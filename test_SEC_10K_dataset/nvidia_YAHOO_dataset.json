    "context": "00:00 Brian Sozzi\n\nThere's something called liberation day was heaved on to all our plates in April. Tariffs are in effect, crypto has finally been embraced by major financial institutions, and the Federal Reserve has started to cut interest rates again. But as soon as the Yahoo Finance team sat down to discuss who deserves to win our 11th annual company of the year award, one thing became abundantly clear. How can this year's winner of our news room's highest honor not be super grounded in AI? They can't. 2025 has been the year where AI has permeated markets and infiltrated our everyday lives. Nvidia is still seen as the leader in AI chips, but Google is now nipping at its heels. Nvidia was also the first public company to ever reach a staggering $5 trillion dollar valuation. Rival AMD managed to make inroads into Nvidia's domination, inking a headline making deal with OpenAI. The deal will bring massive money into AMD and find OpenAI as a long-term investor. Microsoft and OpenAI tightened up their relationship with an eye toward the next decade of AI. Qualcomm said it would get in on the AI chip game next year. Intel got two new investors in the US government and Nvidia. The Mag 7 players earmarked billions of dollars to build more data centers to support their AI ambitions. With that as a backdrop, it's my honor to reveal the three contenders for our 11th annual company of the year award, OpenAI, Oracle, and Nvidia. Over the next week and a half, you will see us preview each of these companies and discuss why they are in the running to take home the crown. The big reveal of the winner winner will be on the morning of December 8th right on the Yahoo Finance homepage and our app with a full day of live coverage on this network. In the meantime, I want to hear from you. Who do you think should win our company of the year award and why out of these three? Have other worthy names? I would love to hear them too. Just drop me a line at Brian Sozzi on X, Instagram, or LinkedIn. Be sure to tag Yahoo Finance.",

When you're ready to invest, check out this top 10 list of stocks to buy.\n\nA full transcript is below.\n\nThis podcast was recorded on Nov.15, 2025.\n\nTim Beyers: What are the opportunities outside the world of AI you're listening Motley Fool Money. Welcome Fools. I'm your host, Tim Byers, and with me are longtime Fools, Karl Thiel and first time Monday pot guest Anthony Schiavone. At how you feeling? Fellas we doing we doing well? Fully caffeinated, I hope.\n\nAnthony Schiavone: Fully caffeinated, Tim.\n\nKarl Thiel: Feeling good.\n\nTim Beyers: Excellent. This is good. Today we're talking about non-AI stocks. Seriously, we are being serious about this. Non-AI stocks, did you even know that there was such a thing as non AI stocks? We'll be digging into reports from four stocks, really three stocks that we don't often talk about and give a buy seller hold rating on each as we do. Let's get into it, starting with Karl, this close to $10 billion deal. I'm rounding up, but it's not quite 10 billion, but a $10 billion deal between Sadara, that is Ticker CDTX, and Merck, the pharmaceutical giant MRK. What's going on here? This is a strategic purchase. I assume here, it's a lot of money. What are we getting here?\n\nKarl Thiel: This is a good old fashioned product/platform deal in the sector. What Sadara does is they're making a most directly what Merck is buying right now is a influenza drug that is not really it shouldn't be subject to year to year variation. It's a different way of going after influenza, and you can see why that would be a relatively big deal. There's a lot of flu shots given out every year.\n\nTim Beyers: Seems timely.\n\nKarl Thiel: I think it's interesting on a number of levels. I mean, one is just that, usually MNA in the pharma sector is just dominated by oncology, and it still is. But we've seen a lot more start going to these broader health issues around obesity and around, in this case, infectious disease, so influenza. The other reason I think it's super interesting is just that it came at a huge premium. I'll say, $9.2 billion all cash deal, 109% premium to where Sadara was trading before that. I just think that gets at the continuing, I think, some mispricing in the sector. I mean, you expect an M&A deal to come at some premium, but that's a pretty big one.\n\nTim Beyers: One of the things I saw here, Karl, so again, $221.50 in cash, that is more than double the prior closing price. Huge premium here. I want to ask whether or not that is a premium that Merck feels it must pay in order to get an active drug that fills a pipeline because one of the things I saw in the notes and bear in mind, I rely on you for 100% of my insights as it relates to pharmaceuticals and biotech. But there is apparently a patent cliff upcoming for Merck in the form of a blockbuster cancer drug called Keytruda. Does this help fill the gap, and is that the reason the premium is so big?\n\nKarl Thiel: Yes, it helps fill the gap. The Keytruda Patten Cliff is a major, major deal for Merck, and it's no mystery to anybody who invests in the stock. Is it the reason the premium is so big? Not necessarily. I actually don't think that Merck is paying an outrageous amount for the company, given that this could be not only a broader drug. This was initially looked at as something that's just for very high risk influenza. Patients, FDA has actually come back and given them the green light to make it slightly potentially a slightly broader drug. Then you could turn around and use this same platform and plug it into other infectious disease agents like fungal disease and things like that. I don't think they're paying an outrageous amount, actually. It's a little different than, say, another $10 billion deal that just closed last week, which is Pfizer Met Sarah, where I think they paid a huge premium.\n\nTim Beyers: Then let me get your take on this, then, and then we're going to keep moving. Buy, sell or hold Merck on the basis of this deal. Is this one that you expect to see compounding value at Merck or where are you at?\n\nKarl Thiel: I think I'm OK. I think I'm going to buy on Merck, just because I think Merck is attractively priced relative to the rest of the market as to whether this deal comes out a winner. I mean, obviously, that depends on a lot of things. But the data has looked good for this approach. I'm, modestly bullish on this. It is possible that this specific deal will end up being a disappointment, but I still think it's not unreasonable move by Merck looking to shore things up.\n\nTim Beyers: Fair enough. Let's move on, Ant. We're going to move on to some earnings, starting with UPS. Apparently, people want to be delivering packages again. Talk to me about what we saw from the UPS earnings report.\n\nAnthony Schiavone: Tim, I think it's fair to say that UPS is firmly in a turnaround. But this quarter, I think investors finally receive some hope that this turnaround is in the early stages of turning. Revenue declined nearly 4% year of a year, and admittedly, that does not sound great. But to put some context around that, the decline was primarily driven by the planned decrease in Amazon package volume that it delivers, as well as some business divestitures. Just looking at UPS's domestic business in the US, and I think this is really interesting, revenue declined nearly 3%, but volumes declined by 12%. That tells me that UPS is shedding lower margin, Amazon, commerce volume and instead focusing on higher margin volumes in healthcare, business to business, and international markets. The result of that is that the revenue per piece, which is a key metric that they track grew 10%, and that's the fastest growth rate they've had in three years. Their domestic operating margin actually expanded slightly, even though the volumes fell 12%. I think that's a really good sign that management's better, not bigger strategy is progressing. On the expense side, with the glide down of those Amazon volumes, UPS expects to reduce expenses by 3.5 billion this year. With that lower volume, UPS needs fewer trailers, they need fewer trucks, fewer aircraft, doesn't need as many buildings. Unfortunately, it also means they need fewer employees, too. But all these decisions are aimed toward becoming a smaller, more efficient UPS. I really think this quarter was a big step in the right direction for the company.\n\nTim Beyers: This does seem to be a real play on, forget about growth, focus on profitability. Are we at the beginning of a surge in profitability for UPS? Do you think is that too bold a statement, or is it are we on the beginnings at the beginnings of a real profitability improvement at this company?\n\nAnthony Schiavone: I was hoping the beginning the profitability improvement would have occurred like two years ago because this plan has been in place for a while now, and there's been a lot of volatility around UPS's quarterly earnings with their labor contract tariffs and all of that. There's a lot of noise in their quarterly results, but this does seem to be that first step toward eventually improving free cash flow, improving operating margins, and improving return on invested capital and just becoming more efficient.\n\nTim Byers: I like all of those things. But let's move on to Chevron. That was up slightly on earnings, so Ticker CVX here. This is a very big company, and up about 1.5% for the week. What did the results look like here and do we like them? Where are you at on this one?\n\nAnthony Schiavone: As a shareholder, I liked them. I thought it was a strong quarter for Chevron, despite lower commodity prices. Production of 4.1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day was a record quarter for the company and 21% higher than last year. Adjusted free cash flow came in at seven billion, and Chevron returned 6 billion to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and buybacks. I thought this was pretty cool. Chevron mentioned that they have returned 78 billion through dividends and buybacks over just the last three years. That's a massive amount of capital relative to what is roughly a $300 billion company today. I think that's really the thesis for traditional energy companies. Whereas in the past, oil and gas companies just wanted to drill and produce as much as possible. Now they're much more focused on returns on capital and returns of capital through dividends and buybacks.\n\nAnthony Schiavone: Chevron's really been at the forefront of the industry shift in capital allocation. That standpoint.\n\nTim Beyers: I want to make sure I got this right, so $300 billion company. Did you say 78 billion returned? Is that three years?\n\nAnthony Schiavone: Three years.\n\nTim Beyers: Over 20 billion a year, really over 25 billion a year, so roughly 25% of its market value returned in terms of cash used for repurchases and dividends.\n\nAnthony Schiavone: Yeah, and I think that should continue, too. They actually just held their Analyst Day I think last week, and they plan to return, I believe the number is $10-20 billion annually through 2030. That is. They're still returning a lot of cash to shareholders, even as commodity prices have come down.\n\nTim Beyers: That's extraordinary. Fair enough. Let's get your buy sell on hold on each of these, Ant quickly. On UPS, a more profitable UPS are you buying this?\n\nAnthony Schiavone: I am buying it. If you look at a dividend yield. It's about 7% today. Now, that dividend payout is not currently covered by free cash flow, but I do think it's sustainable, considering the balance sheet and the investments it's making today to support that higher free cash flow in the future. I think that 7% dividend yield alone might be enough to beat the market over, like a 5-10 year period, considering where market valuations are today. I think it's a buy.\n\nTim Beyers: How about Chevron? Same question, buy sell or hold.\n\nAnthony Schiavone: Also going with the buy. Roughly 4.3% dividend yield today, management expects to grow free cash flow at a 10% annual rate through 2030. That represents a double digit expected return over the next five years, and I think that beats the market.\n\nTim Beyers: Fair enough. There you go. There is your non-AI stocks overview. Up next, we're going to do a variation on our faker or breaker game. We're going to give it a little dividend twist. We're calling it back it or bid in. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.\n\nFools, it's time for back it or bid it and apologies for the name change here, but we wanted to try something a little bit different. We're going to go with a dividend bent here. The companies, three companies that haven't necessarily been let's say, very aggressive in raising their dividends over the past few years. I want your takes. You back it or bid to increase the dividend in 2026. We're going to start with Wabtec, which is the former Westinghouse Air Brakes Technology Corporation. This is essentially making equipment systems, maybe some digital software for rail transportation, including freight rail transit rail. They've been around for quite some time. They make train control systems. Ant let me start with you here. I'll give you some stats. For 2025, they are forecasting 6.6% revenue growth. This is definitely a free cash flow generator. They have been converting a huge amount of their operating cash as free cash flow. They have a free cash flow margin of well over 12% here, but they only have a dividend payout ratio of 12%. Why is this dividend not higher? Do you expect it to go up in 2026? Back or bid it, what do you say?\n\nAnthony Schiavone: I'm going to back it. You mentioned that dividend payout ratio is only about 12%. That's at the low end of management's targeted payout ratio of about 10%-15%. They have a stated goal to increase dividends. That dividend growth rate is accelerating over the last two years, so I think a dividend increase this year or even next year is probable.\n\nTim Beyers: Ticker WAB, that is Wabtec, so we back it for some dividend growth here. Carl, I'm going to go to you on stock that you own. We're talking toys, Hasbro. By the way, I had forgotten. Did you know this that Hasbro is the home of Plato? I didn't know that. I mean, I knew they were the home of monopoly and D&D. I didn't know they were the home of Plato.\n\nKarl Thiel: No, Plato's been a thing for a long time.\n\nTim Beyers: The total revenue up 7% for the first nine months of 2025. They have a significant free cash flow margin, 75% of free cash flow is what they dedicate to the dividend today. Where are you at, Carl here, 75% of free cash flow for the dividend is that's not a small amount. Do you back it or bid it to grow that dividend for you as a shareholder?\n\nKarl Thiel: I'm going to say bid it for 2026. I hope they don't honestly increase the dividend, and this company they already pay something like a 3.6% yield. It's not a terrible yield on this stock, and they've got a number of challenges. I think if you just think of a company that's making things going into the consumer market, a lot of them are manufactured in China, you can fill in the blanks on what some of the challenges might be. They've got a fair bit of debt. They've been focused on that. They're in a multi year turnaround plan and doing OK. I do think that they're starting to come up out of it, so I think they're doing reasonably well. I don't think this is a bad time to come to investors and say, look, the capital, we don't need to increase the dividend, right now. We've got better uses for the capital.\n\nTim Beyers: Fair enough. Ant, let's come to you on our final one, Hasbro's Ticker HAS. This one is pretty simple ticker, CF Industries Ticker CF. Talking about fertilizer here. Ant, this is fertilizer. Hydrogen and nitrogen. This is a big supplier to the agricultural sector. A lot of ammonia based, ammonium nitrate, fertilizer and so forth. This is an interesting company. They generate a huge amount of free cash flow. For the trailing 12 months, free cash flow, according to Alpha sense was 1.7 billion. That's through September 30th. Payout ratio on the dividend is pretty low. It is averaged between 24% and 35%. For a company that doesn't generate, I mean, they generate decent revenue growth. They generate a ton of cash. Do you back CF to increase the dividend to raise that payout ratio, or is it bid it? What do you say?\n\nAnthony Schiavone: I think this is a company that has the ability to raise its dividend and probably will looking over like a five plus year time horizon. But will it increase it in 2026? I'm not so sure. Management seems to prefer share buybacks right now. They did just increase the dividend considerably in 2022 and 2023. I think looking at 2026, I think a dividend increase is largely going to depend on commodity prices and trying to predict what commodity prices are going to do in a one year window is pretty difficult. I think I'm going to bid it with CF Industries.\n\nTim Beyers: Fair enough. Bidding it. There are your there's your three stocks, dividend growth over the next year. Wabtec, Ant says back it, Hasbro, Carl's has bid it and CF Industries, Ants has bid it. If you want dividend growth, the Old Westinghouse Airbrake Technologies Corporation, that's your one to go with maybe. We can't give you personalized advice on this popcast sorry.

    "key_insights": "Merck executed a highly strategic, all-cash acquisition of Cidara Therapeutics for $9.2 billion, paying a significant 109% premium to acquire an influenza drug platform designed to help offset the massive upcoming patent cliff faced by its blockbuster cancer drug, Keytruda. Concurrently, UPS demonstrated progress in its 'better, not bigger' strategy, intentionally reducing domestic volume by 12% (primarily Amazon-related packages) to boost profitability, which resulted in a 10% surge in revenue per piece and a slight expansion of domestic operating margins despite the overall volume contraction.",

How much larger was the percentage drop in volume compared to the percentage drop in revenue, and what key metric confirmed that this disparity was achieved by shedding lower-margin business?",
        "answer": "The volume decline (12%) was approximately 9 percentage points greater than the revenue decline (nearly 3%). This disparity confirmed that the company was successfully shedding lower-margin volumes while retaining or growing higher-margin volumes, which was evidenced by the key metric of revenue per piece growing by 10%, achieving its fastest growth rate in three years."

The recently signed US$128 million Washington conversion deal has become the most important short-term catalyst, as it directly accelerates the company's move to AI data centers, while delays in regulatory approval remain the biggest near-term threat to the narrative.\n\nAmong the recent announcements, Bitfarms’ Q3 report is especially relevant: year-over-year revenue surged 156%, attributed in part to increased energy infrastructure and mining activity, and the company finalized a US$588 million convertible note offer. Together with the US$128 million Washington project, this improved liquidity positions Bitfarms to advance its buildout and pursue its AI-focused ambitions, but execution risk and the need for ongoing access to financing are still front of mind.\n\nOn the other hand, for investors, concerns still linger around whether the regulatory path for megawatt conversion will be clearly defined and timely...\n\nRead the full narrative on Bitfarms (it's free!)\n\nBitfarms' outlook anticipates $504.8 million in revenue and $58.8 million in earnings by 2028.

    "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/11/29/could-the-nvidia-killer-be-hiding-in-plain-sight-3/",
    "context": "Nvidia was an early leader in AI and has reaped the rewards. But it may soon need to defend its crown.\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) market is booming, and could grow from $235 billion last year to $631 billion by 2028. The top AI stocks have already enjoyed tremendous returns since early 2023, and the future looks bright. Remember, the internet hasn't stopped growing since its initial boom decades ago.\n\nNvidia has arguably been the most apparent AI winner thus far. Its GPU chips have become the de facto choice for AI hyperscalers training and operating AI models, a Golden Goose that has generated $187 billion in revenue over the past four quarters alone.\n\nBut most of that has come from a relatively small handful of these hypercalers. As spending for all these data center projects adds up, the pressure is building for hyperscalers to cut costs.\n\nThese three companies, which are, ironically, Nvidia's own customers, could kill Nvidia's Golden Goose. They are threats sitting in plain sight.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nAfter the recent unveiling of its Gemini 3 AI model, Alphabet (GOOGL +0.07%)(GOOG 0.05%) might pose the most serious threat to Nvidia's AI dominance. From most accounts, Gemini 3 is a highly impressive step forward for AI models. But perhaps the most remarkable thing about Gemini 3 is that Alphabet apparently trained it on its own proprietary AI chips rather than Nvidia's GPUs.\n\nExpand NASDAQ : GOOGL Alphabet Today's Change ( 0.07 %) $ 0.23 Current Price $ 320.18 Key Data Points Market Cap $3864B Day's Range $ 316.79 - $ 326.85 52wk Range $ 140.53 - $ 328.83 Volume 26M Avg Vol 38M Gross Margin 59.18 % Dividend Yield 0.26 %\n\nNvidia's GPUs use the company's CUDA programming to efficiently harness the immense computing power of GPUs for AI tasks. However, Alphabet's Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) are application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), meaning they are designed and built for one job and one job only. In this case, that's Alphabet's AI.\n\nAlphabet's success in training Gemini 3 with its TPUs shows that Nvidia's GPUs aren't irreplaceable. That doesn't mean other companies will easily do what Alphabet did, but it does send the message that it's possible. Over time, other hyperscalers could design their own AI ASICs, potentially eating into Nvidia's business.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nOther hyperscalers have also developed custom AI chips. Amazon (AMZN +1.77%) operates AWS, the world's leading cloud computing services platform. AI has created tailwinds for AWS because it primarily runs in the cloud, as does most modern software. Amazon continues to build data centers to increase its cloud capacity, and those data centers require many chips.\n\nExpand NASDAQ : AMZN Amazon Today's Change ( 1.77 %) $ 4.06 Current Price $ 233.22 Key Data Points Market Cap $2493B Day's Range $ 230.22 - $ 233.28 52wk Range $ 161.38 - $ 258.60 Volume 20M Avg Vol 48M Gross Margin 50.05 % Dividend Yield N/A\n\nAmazon has developed its own AI chip, Trainium, and has begun to assert it more. The company has a partnership with Anthropic, the developer of the AI application Claude. The two companies recently announced the activation of Project Rainier, a massive AI chip cluster. It's using nearly half a million Trainium2 chips, and that will scale to over 1 million by the end of this year.\n\nIt doesn't necessarily mean Nvidia is out of the picture, but it loosens Nvidia's stranglehold on the market. At the very least, Nvidia, which has enjoyed 70% gross margins over the past year, could begin feeling some pressure. Between Amazon's own chip needs and those of a prominent AI developer such as Anthropic, further leaning into Trainium is another potential headwind for Nvidia's growth.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nIf you've noticed a theme by now, you'd be correct. Some of Nvidia's biggest customers have begun looking for ways to reduce their dependence on Nvidia's GPUs. Microsoft (MSFT +1.34%) is yet another name on this list for similar reasons. Not only is Microsoft's Azure the world's second-leading cloud services platform, but it also has a close partnership with ChatGPT developer OpenAI.\n\nExpand NASDAQ : MSFT Microsoft Today's Change ( 1.34 %) $ 6.51 Current Price $ 492.01 Key Data Points Market Cap $3657B Day's Range $ 486.65 - $ 492.63 52wk Range $ 344.79 - $ 555.45 Volume 14M Avg Vol 22M Gross Margin 68.76 % Dividend Yield 0.69 %\n\nOpenAI is the leading AI developer, as ChatGPT is the most popular AI app. However, the company is operating at heavy losses and has recently faced intensifying scrutiny over how it will fund $1.4 trillion in AI infrastructure it has signed agreements for. It seems that the days of writing blank checks for GPUs are nearly over.\n\nMicrosoft and OpenAI recently restructured their partnership and will work more closely on custom AI chips. OpenAI has been designing custom chips with Broadcom, and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently suggested that Microsoft will contribute to those efforts so that both companies can benefit. Once again, it's a shot across Nvidia's bow, a signal that its lucrative dominance in AI data center chips may soon face serious challenges.",
    "key_insights": "Nvidia faces an existential threat to its highly profitable GPU business, which recently generated $187 billion in revenue with 70% gross margins, as its key customers aggressively pursue custom chips. Hyperscalers like Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft are developing proprietary ASICs (TPUs, Trainium) to cut rising data center costs and reduce dependency on Nvidia’s hardware and CUDA ecosystem. The successful training of Alphabet’s Gemini 3 on its own TPUs and Amazon’s plan to scale Trainium deployment to over 1 million chips signals a definitive shift away from the era of writing blank checks for Nvidia GPUs.",

    "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/11/29/what-is-the-smartest-quantum-computing-stock-to/",
    "context": "Pure-plays like IonQ, Rigetti Computing, and D-Wave Quantum remain the most popular opportunities in quantum computing at the moment.\n\nFor the past three years, investing in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks was reserved almost exclusively for companies designing semiconductors or developing next-generation software.\n\nOver the last year, however, a new pocket of the AI landscape has become increasingly popular. Investors are now complementing their core AI positions with quantum computing stocks. As is the case with any new trend, there are a number of opportunities in the quantum AI market -- some more established than others.\n\nBelow, I'll break down why Nvidia (NVDA 1.83%) could be the smartest quantum computing stock to buy right now and detail how the chip giant's approach to this emerging technology differs from the competition.\n\nWho are the major players in quantum computing?\n\nThe quantum computing market can be split into two categories. On one side are such pure plays as IonQ, Rigetti Computing, and D-Wave Quantum. In addition, cloud hyperscalers like Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon have also made investments in quantum computing.\n\nFor the most part, the pure plays have garnered limited business traction so far. One reason for that is quantum computing is still an exploratory technology with little in the way of commercial applications.\n\nIn addition, all three pure-plays are investing heavily into research and development. They're trying to prove that their trapped ion and quantum superconducting approaches will actually yield a technological breakthrough that leads to widespread adoption at the enterprise level. Until this happens, companies like IonQ, Rigetti, and D-Wave will likely continue burning cash.\n\nIn big tech, Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft are each designing their own custom quantum computing chips. While such an approach could lead to additional products and services that can be integrated into their broader cloud infrastructures, none of these companies uses quantum AI within their respective ecosystems yet.\n\nExpand NASDAQ : NVDA Nvidia Today's Change ( -1.83 %) $ -3.30 Current Price $ 176.96 Key Data Points Market Cap $4301B Day's Range $ 176.50 - $ 179.28 52wk Range $ 86.62 - $ 212.19 Volume 3.6M Avg Vol 193M Gross Margin 70.05 % Dividend Yield 0.02 %\n\nHow is Nvidia involved with quantum computing?\n\nIn order to appreciate Nvidia's role in the quantum computing realm, it's important to first understand how this technology actually works.\n\nIn classical computing, developers write code in a series of binary bits -- 0's and 1's. In quantum computing systems, these bits can exist in multiple places at the same time through a property known as superposition. For this reason, the underlying code in quantum architecture is written in qubits (quantum bits) as opposed to a binary structure.\n\nWhile quantum computers can theoretically process complex simulations at much faster speeds compared to traditional computing systems, qubits themselves are quite fragile and prone to errors.\n\nThis is where Nvidia enters the equation. Nvidia sells a full stack of hardware and software tools that can be paired with quantum supercomputers. For instance, the company's GPUs, CPUs, CUDA-Q software platform, and NVQLink interconnect all serve as the infrastructure backbone for a hybrid quantum-classical computing environment.\n\nNvidia isn't trying to build its own computer or design the best quantum chip. Instead, Nvidia's approach is more agnostic. It's seeking to integrate with different types of quantum systems, all while leveraging its core AI infrastructure stack along with newer quantum-oriented product lines as well.\n\nThis playbook is quite savvy, as Nvidia's approach allows the company to continue selling its GPU hardware while simultaneously parlaying its existing infrastructure into a new series of quantum computing services. In essence, Nvidia is taking more of a pick-and-shovel approach to quantum computing -- using this emerging technology to remain an industry leader within the broader AI opportunity.\n\nIs Nvidia stock a buy right now?\n\nAs of this writing (Nov. 24), Nvidia's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple is 23.4. To put this into perspective, the stock was trading around 34 times forward earnings this time last year. I think this level of multiple compression tells a lot about how the market views Nvidia right now. Just three years ago, the company was seen as the ultimate darling of the AI revolution.\n\nHowever, with concerns about AI becoming a stock market bubble on the rise, in combination with new competition from Advanced Micro Devices and custom silicon designs from the hyperscalers, some investors may fear that Nvidia's best days are behind it.\n\nMeanwhile, the company continues to innovate at a rapid pace -- introducing new GPU architectures as well as positioning itself for emerging opportunities across robotics, autonomous systems, telecoms, and of course, quantum computing. Each of these efforts is a calculated move to expand Nvidia's long-run total addressable market (TAM).\n\nAgainst this backdrop, I think Nvidia stock is becoming too cheap to ignore. In my eyes, the market is heavily discounting the company's next wave of growth -- making Nvidia a compelling opportunity to buy and hold as sentiment eventually catches up with the underlying fundamentals of a company that continues to execute at a record pace.",
    "key_insights": "Nvidia is employing a savvy, agnostic \"pick-and-shovel\" strategy in quantum computing, focusing on providing essential hardware and software infrastructure (GPUs, CUDA-Q) rather than building proprietary quantum chips. This allows the company to leverage its existing AI infrastructure, insulating it from the high capital burn and commercial uncertainty currently facing pure-play competitors. Despite concerns over AI market saturation, the analyst views the stock as a compelling buy due to its compressed forward P/E multiple of 23.4 and rapid innovation across emerging markets.",

        "question": "Given Nvidia’s 52-week trading range and its Gross Margin of 70.05%, what is the theoretical dollar amount represented by the gross margin percentage when applied to the full 52-week price fluctuation?",
        "answer": "The 52-week high is $212.19 and the low is $86.62, resulting in a fluctuation of $125.57. Applying the 70.05% Gross Margin to this figure yields an approximate dollar value of $87.95 ($125.57 * 0.7005)."

        "answer": "Nvidia mitigates the risk of cash burning by adopting an agnostic approach, selling essential infrastructure (GPUs, CUDA-Q) that immediately leverages its existing AI hardware stack within hybrid computing environments. In contrast, pure-play firms face high financial risk because they are investing heavily in exploratory R&D to prove technological breakthroughs, meaning they will likely continue burning cash until widespread commercial applications materialize."

    "context": "Nvidia's customers recently offered investors a glimpse of what lies ahead.\n\nNvidia (NVDA 1.83%) has been a massive winner for investors over the long term, for example, climbing 1,200% over the past five years. But in 2025, performance of the artificial intelligence (AI) chip giant, though still positive as the stock is heading for a 34% gain, has experienced some ups and downs. News of President Donald Trump's import tariffs, as well as export restrictions on chip sales to China, hurt the stock in the spring. And though it rebounded in the following months, in recent weeks, concern about the possibility of an AI bubble forming put new pressure on the stock.\n\nMoving forward, though, Nvidia has what it takes to deliver significant growth in earnings and stock price gains, too. Let's check out the real reason this AI stock could be a huge winner in 2026.\n\nNvidia's GPU dominance\n\nFirst, though, let's catch up on the full Nvidia story. The company designs the fastest graphics processing units (GPUs) on the market -- these are the chips that power the training of AI and the actual application of the technology to real-world situations and problems. Nvidia entered the space early, well before AI became an investment theme, and this has helped it stay ahead of rivals -- and the company's ongoing innovation is part of this success story, too.\n\nAll of this has brought Nvidia explosive earnings growth, with annual revenue and profit climbing in the double- and triple-digits to reach record levels. And in the recent quarter, this growth continued, with Nvidia again surpassing analysts' expectations and speaking of strong demand for its Blackwell architecture and its update, Blackwell Ultra.\n\nAs mentioned, though, general concern about tariffs and economic growth, as well as the valuations of AI stocks, have weighed on investor appetite for Nvidia stock at certain moments this year. Even the company's recent blowout earnings report didn't offer the stock a lift.\n\nExpand NASDAQ : NVDA Nvidia Today's Change ( -1.83 %) $ -3.30 Current Price $ 176.96 Key Data Points Market Cap $4301B Day's Range $ 176.50 - $ 179.28 52wk Range $ 86.62 - $ 212.19 Volume 3.6M Avg Vol 193M Gross Margin 70.05 % Dividend Yield 0.02 %\n\nAn interesting prediction from Jensen Huang\n\nStill, I'm optimistic about the tech giant in 2026, and I think the following will be the real reason for earnings and stock price gains. A few months ago, Nvidia chief Jensen Huang made an interesting prediction: He said he expects AI infrastructure spending to reach between $3 trillion and $4 trillion by the end of the decade.\n\nMeanwhile, customers of Nvidia, such as cloud service providers Amazon and Microsoft, recently spoke of soaring demand and their plans to expand capacity. All of this points to an increase in need for the world's top-performing chips, and these are Nvidia's GPUs.\n\nAs this AI infrastructure spending story starts to unfold, Nvidia should see the results in its earnings reports -- this, along with the fact that Nvidia's valuation remains reasonable at 38x forward earnings estimates, might put Nvidia back on investors' \"buy list.\" And all of this could make Nvidia a huge winner in 2026.",
    "key_insights": "Despite phenomenal long-term returns and recent blowout earnings fueled by its GPU market dominance and strong demand for the Blackwell architecture, Nvidia's stock has faced significant recent headwinds. These pressures include macroeconomic concerns like import tariffs, export restrictions to China, and generalized fears of an 'AI bubble,' which have prevented the stock from achieving a lift from positive news. However, the anticipated massive AI infrastructure spending, projected to reach $3 trillion to $4 trillion by the end of the decade, remains the core strategic driver positioning Nvidia for substantial stock price gains in 2026.",

        "answer": "The minimum predicted AI infrastructure spending of $3 trillion, when compared to Nvidia's current Market Cap of $4301 billion ($4.301 trillion), represents approximately 69.75% of the company's valuation. This comparison underscores the enormous scale of the total addressable market opportunity that Nvidia is poised to capture through its GPU dominance, driving expected future earnings growth."

This calculation (($212.19 - $176.96) / $212.19) demonstrates that even with positive long-term fundamentals, the stock is trading significantly below its recent high, reflecting the substantial investor pressure caused by macroeconomic and valuation concerns."

    "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marjorie-taylor-greene-stocks-jumped-181500027.html",
    "context": "But critics point to unusually well-timed trades — purchases that seemed to anticipate market-moving announcements from the Trump administration. Whether savvy investing or something more concerning, her five biggest wins offer lessons for any investor navigating volatile markets.\n\nGreene attributes her success to a portfolio manager who handles all trades under a fiduciary agreement. \"I don't place my buys and sells,\" she told reporters at a Georgia town hall (2). \"He did a great job. Guess what he did. He bought the dip.\"\n\nMTG has been on fire in 2025. Out of 216 total trades this year, 161 are currently profitable — a hedge-fund-like 74.5% win rate. A remarkable 92 of those trades have gained more than 10%.\n\nIn 2024, Greene ranked as the 23rd best-performing trader in Congress, with her portfolio gaining 30.2% compared to the S&P 500's 24.9% return. She's executed over 450 stock trades since joining the House and bought $3.89 million in stocks in 2024 alone.\n\nAt time of writing, Greene will leave Congress in January with an estimated net worth of $25 million according to Quiver Quantitative (1). That’s a 33% increase in overall wealth — but the real story is in her stock portfolio, which has ballooned to an estimated $2.6 million to $4 million, up 476% since 2021.\n\nApproaching retirement with no savings? Don’t panic, you’re not alone. Here are 6 easy ways you can catch up (and fast)\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nThat detail has been widely misunderstood. Several outlets have reported a pre-Congress net worth of $700,000 — a figure that appears to refer only to her stock holdings. Her 2020 disclosure makes clear she was already a multi-millionaire before taking office.\n\nGreene’s 2020 candidate financial disclosure showed a total net worth of roughly $18.8 million. Most of that came from her 51% stake in Taylor Commercial, Inc., valued between $5 million and $25 million, plus several million in real estate. Her stock portfolio at the time was relatively small: about $630,000 spread across roughly 50 individual holdings.\n\nOn Nov. 21, 2025, the Georgia Republican announced she would resign effective Jan. 5, 2026, citing a bitter falling out with President Donald Trump over her demands to release the Jeffrey Epstein files.\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene is leaving Congress, but not before one of the best investment runs ever by a sitting politician.\n\nStory Continues\n\n5. AMD (NASDAQ: AMD): The AI chip play\n\nGreene has been one of AMD's most consistent congressional buyers, purchasing shares of Advanced Micro Devices over a dozen times since 2021. In 2025 alone, she's made multiple purchases and the timing has paid off.\n\nHer April 2025 AMD buys shot up over 80% from her first purchase and roughly 50% from her second. The semiconductor giant has been one of her best-performing positions this year. What's the play? AMD is a direct beneficiary of the AI boom, competing with Nvidia for data center and AI chip dominance. Greene's repeated purchases suggest a long-term conviction in the sector, or at least her advisor's conviction.\n\nThe lesson: Dollar-cost averaging into a high-conviction position can smooth out volatility and build substantial gains over time. Greene didn't try to time a single perfect entry, she kept buying through dips and rallies alike.\n\n4. The big tech basket: Buying what she knows\n\nIndividual blockbusters aside, Greene has consistently accumulated shares in familiar tech giants:\n\nAdobe: Purchased in 6 of 10 months in 2025\n\nAmazon: Frequent purchases throughout 2024-2025\n\nAlphabet: Bought five days before a favorable court ruling sent shares higher\n\nApple, Microsoft, Meta: Regular additions\n\nHer most dramatic sequence came with CrowdStrike. After buying shares on June 24, 2024 at $377.93 — just before the July IT outage that sent the stock crashing — her advisor doubled down with additional purchases in September. Today CrowdStrike trades around $507 and recently reached an all-time high of $557.53. The post-crash buys are up 75–100%, and even her poorly timed June purchase is still up about 34%.\n\nThe lesson: Don't bet everything on one stock. Greene's strategy spreads risk across multiple tech giants — if one stumbles (like CrowdStrike after the outage), others can carry the portfolio. Sector diversification within a high-conviction theme reduces the pain of any single miss.\n\nAnother lesson: The best gains come from stocks everyone else has given up on. Greene's advisor turned CrowdStrike from her worst-timed trade into one of her best by buying the crash. When a quality company stumbles on a fixable problem, that's often an opportunity for investors.\n\nHonorable mention: Bitcoin ETF (NASDAQ: IBIT)\n\nGreene also made headlines for her iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF purchases in early 2025. She bought shares on Jan. 8 just before Trump's inauguration, and doubled down on March 3, purchasing $15,000 to $50,000 worth just three days before Trump signed an executive order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.\n\nAt Bitcoin's October 2025 peak of around $126,000, those trades were up roughly 30-37%. But the crypto crash in November dragged prices back down to roughly $91,000 — erasing her gains and leaving the position near break-even.\n\nThe lesson: Crypto's volatility is not to be underestimated. Even well-timed trades can take a round-trip back to below your starting position if you don't take profits. Greene's Bitcoin bet looked brilliant in October — and far less impressive by Thanksgiving. It remains to be seen if it'll look brilliant again.\n\n3. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA): A MAGA momentum play\n\nGreene has been accumulating Tesla shares throughout 2024 and 2025, buying the stock in at least five of the first 10 months of 2025. Her best-timed Tesla purchase came in September 2024, when she bought shares at around $210. By late October, the stock had surged to $269 — an 85.6% gain.\n\nThe trade came before Tesla's impressive third-quarter 2024 earnings, which helped the company recover from its controversial \"Robotaxi\" event. Greene also bought shares on Nov. 1, 2024 — just days before the presidential election that would send Tesla soaring as Elon Musk's relationship with Trump deepened.\n\nWhile Greene chaired the Subcommittee on Delivering on Government Efficiency (DOGE), she also defended Tesla publicly and pushed for investigations into anti-Tesla activism. Critics argue this created conflict-of-interest concerns.\n\nThe lesson: Pay attention to who's in power. Investing in companies with political tailwinds is great pattern recognition. Tesla surged after Trump's election as Musk became the administration's closest billionaire ally. Make sure to take a look at what new government contracts companies close to the administration are likely to close.\n\n2. Palantir (NASDAQ: PLTR): Government contract goldmine\n\nGreene purchased Palantir shares on April 7 and April 8, 2025, paying $77.32 and $92.01 per share respectively. Three days later, on April 11, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement awarded Palantir a $29.9 million contract for a surveillance system to prioritize deportation cases. The deal was made public on April 17.\n\nBy early July, Palantir stock had reached $144.25 — an 86.5% gain from her first trade. By August 2025, the stock was up 142% from her purchase price.\n\nGreene encountered controversy over this as she sits on the House Committee on Homeland Security, which oversees ICE. Palantir regularly lands government contracts for intelligence and surveillance work. Several of Palantir's co-founders, including Peter Thiel, are prominent Trump supporters.\n\nGreene says she doesn't sit on the specific subcommittee that oversees ICE (she's on Counterterrorism and Intelligence), and that her portfolio manager made the trade without her knowledge. \"I learned about my Palantir trades when I saw it in the media,\" she said in an emailed statement to Snopes (3).\n\nIn total, Greene has bought Palantir stock four times in 2025 alone.\n\nThe lesson: Government contractors can be lucrative investments — Palantir stock is up over 420% in the past year. But for everyday investors, it's key to pay attention to companies with \"sticky\" revenue streams from long-term government contracts. Microsoft is a great example of this.\n\n1. The tariff trades: 'Liberation Day' timing\n\nOn April 8-9, 2025, Greene disclosed buying between $21,000 and $315,000 worth of stocks in 17 companies — including Amazon, Apple, Nike, Tesla, Nvidia and Palantir according to a public disclosure. She also sold between $50,000 and $100,000 in Treasury bills at the same time.\n\nHours later, President Trump announced a 90-day pause on his sweeping \"reciprocal tariffs.\" Markets soared. The stocks Greene had just purchased jumped immediately:\n\nPalantir: +44% since April 9\n\nNvidia: +23%\n\nTesla: +24%\n\nAmazon: +11%\n\nRH (Restoration Hardware): +24.6%\n\nLam Research: +13%\n\nDell: +10%\n\nDemocratic lawmakers, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Chuck Schumer, sent a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission requesting an investigation into whether insider knowledge influenced Greene's trades. Greene's response? \"I think that criticism is laughable. President Trump has been talking about tariffs for decades,\" she said in the Georgia town hall mentioned earlier (2).\n\nShe maintains her portfolio manager made the trades independently based on publicly available information.\n\nThe lesson: Buying when others are selling — \"buying the dip\" — has historically been a winning strategy. The April 2025 tariff chaos was a textbook example of market overreaction. The challenge? Most retail investors don't have the nerve (or the information) to buy during panic selling.\n\nRead More: Are you richer than you think? 5 clear signs you’re punching way above the average American\n\nIs any of this actually legal?\n\nMembers of Congress are allowed to buy and sell stocks. The Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act of 2012 requires them to disclose trades over $1,000 within 45 days. But that 45-day delay means retail investors can't copy trades in real time.\n\nGreene has faced calls for investigation from both Democrats and Republicans:\n\nApril 2025: Warren and Schumer requested an SEC investigation into her tariff-adjacent trades\n\nAugust 2025: House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries called her \"exhibit A\" for congressional corruption (4)\n\nRepublican criticism: Rep. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.) said her trades are \"just another reason why stock trading by members of Congress or their spouses should be banned\" (5)\n\nSen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) has introduced the \"PELOSI Act\" — the Preventing Elected Leaders from Owning Securities and Investments Act — which would ban members of Congress from trading stocks. The PELOSI Act is named after the poster-child of congressional trading controversy, Nancy Pelosi, whose investments were revealed to be up over 16,000%. Both Speaker Mike Johnson and President Trump have voiced support for such a ban.\n\nGreene rejects the criticism and argues, \"I refuse to hide my stock trades in a blind trust like many others do. All of my investments are reported with full transparency.\" (3)\n\nWhere does Greene's money actually come from?\n\nGreene's wealth isn't solely from stock trading. According to her 2020 candidate disclosure and subsequent annual filings, here's the breakdown:\n\nMajor assets (2020 pre-Congress disclosure):\n\nTaylor Commercial Inc.: Greene and her then-husband owned 100% of her family's construction business, valued at $5 million to $25 million, generating $100,001 to $1 million annually in distributions\n\nMarconi Drive Offices, Inc.: Real estate holding valued at $1 million to $5 million, generating $100,001 to $1 million in rent\n\nGreene Raleigh Gardens, LLC: Real estate valued at $50,001 to $100,000\n\nCash accounts: $100,001 to $250,000 in Schwab and Wells Fargo accounts\n\nRetirement accounts: Approximately $465,000 across various 401K plans\n\nIndividual stocks: Roughly $630,000 across 50+ holdings\n\nCurrent assets (2025):\n\nTaylor Commercial Inc.: Now valued at $5 million to $25 million, but Greene retains only a 51% stake following her 2022 divorce\n\nPMLTD, Inc.: Real estate company valued at $1 million to $5 million\n\nCongressional Federal Credit Union: $1 million to $5 million in cash\n\nWashington D.C. condo: Non-primary residence worth $500,001 to $1 million\n\nStock portfolio: Estimated $2.6 million to $4 million in publicly traded assets\n\nCongressional salary: $174,000 annually\n\nBook royalties: $178,229.99 in 2024 from her autobiography MTG\n\nIn August 2025 she pushed back against critics and her commonly cited 2021 $700,000 net worth figure on X: “I’ve owned my family’s construction business for well over two decades and made all of my net worth BEFORE I became a Member of Congress… Go to hell.” (6).\n\nThe bottom line\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene's trading record — 30.2% returns in 2024, a 74.5% win rate in 2025, and a 476% increase in her stock portfolio since 2021 — is extraordinary by any measure. Whether it reflects a shrewd eye, fortunate timing or something more troubling is up to regulators.\n\nHer departure from Congress won't end the scrutiny. If anything, Greene's resignation puts a spotlight on just how lucrative stock trading can be for members of Congress. She entered with a stock portfolio worth roughly $630,000 and left with one worth an estimated $3-4 million — plus a book deal, a media profile and holdings stuffed with tech stocks and Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nFor regular investors, the actionable lessons are simpler: build positions in quality names over time, don't panic during volatility, and pay attention to where government money is flowing.\n\nJust remember: you're playing a different game than members of Congress. They may have access to information you don't — and that's exactly why the debate over congressional stock trading isn't going away anytime soon.\n\nYou May Also Like\n\nWriter's note: I do not currently hold positions in any of these companies.

    "key_insights": "Marjorie Taylor Greene's investment portfolio, managed by an external advisor, achieved exceptional returns, including a 74.5% win rate in 2025 and a 30.2% gain in 2024, significantly outpacing the S&P 500. However, the timing of several highly profitable trades (e.g., Palantir, Tesla) immediately preceding favorable political or governmental announcements has drawn criticism regarding potential conflicts of interest, despite the use of a fiduciary agreement.",

        "question": "Based on the documented financial figures, what percentage of Marjorie Taylor Greene's estimated absolute increase in overall net worth since 2020 can be attributed to the minimum estimated absolute growth of her stock portfolio?",
        "answer": "The total net worth increased from roughly $18.8 million (2020 disclosure) to an estimated $25 million, resulting in an absolute gain of $6.2 million. The stock portfolio, starting at $630,000, grew by 476%, equating to an absolute minimum gain of approximately $3.0 million ($630,000 * 4.76). Therefore, the minimum stock portfolio growth accounts for approximately 48.4% of the overall $6.2 million wealth increase.",
        "supporting_analysis": "Requires synthesizing the 2020 net worth ($18.8M) and current net worth ($25M) to find the absolute total increase ($6.2M), calculating the absolute gain of the stock portfolio ($630k * 476% = $3.0M), and then finding the ratio of stock gain to total wealth increase ($3.0M / $6.2M)."

      {
        "question": "Considering the performance metrics provided for Greene's trading in 2024, what was the required return percentage of her portfolio to achieve the $3.89 million in stock purchases she executed that year?",
        "answer": "The text states her portfolio gained 30.2% in 2024. The amount of stock purchased ($3.89 million) is an input or investment metric, separate from the rate of return achieved on the existing portfolio during that period. No return percentage is 'required' to execute a specific dollar amount of purchases; the 30.2% return is the outcome of the trading activity, independent of the volume of new capital deployed.",
        "supporting_analysis": "This question tests the understanding of the difference between capital deployment (purchases: $3.89M) and portfolio performance (return: 30.2%). The data points are independent, making the query unanswerable as posed because purchases do not dictate the return percentage, but rather capital allocation."

    "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/11/29/is-the-ai-hype-cycle-just-beginning-why-the-bigges/",
    "context": "Soaring spending on AI and the many proven use cases for the technology should ease investors' fears about an AI stock bubble.\n\nNvidia (NVDA 1.83%) set the foundation for one of the biggest multiyear stock market rallies in recent memory. Artificial intelligence (AI) became the buzzword of the moment, and investors poured their capital into shares of every company that had any connection to the innovative technology.\n\nThe current AI boom resembles the dot-com boom. New technology has captivated people's imaginations, and on Wall Street, the question to ponder is just how much companies can boost their revenue by using it.\n\nWhen the dot-com bubble burst, the result was a steep decline and significant losses, even though eventually, the internet ended up changing every industry. And in the wake of the remarkable run-ups that so many tech stocks have experienced in the past few years, some investors are worried that AI stocks are in a bubble of their own. However, there are key differences between the dot-com era and this one that suggest the AI hype cycle is just beginning.\n\nAI is already producing profits\n\nOne critical weakness of the dot-com bubble was that most of the companies that participated in it weren't profitable, but adding \".com\" to the end of a struggling corporation's name was enough to send its shares soaring. This is also the period when Mark Cuban sold unprofitable Broadcast.com to Yahoo for $5.7 billion, giving it a price-to-sales ratio of 57.\n\nAI doesn't just deliver headlines. It also generates profits for its investors. Nvidia made almost $32 billion in its fiscal 2026 Q3, in large part due to sales of GPUs that will be used to power AI workloads. Tech giants like Meta Platforms and Microsoft have also boosted their profits with AI-related revenues and by using AI tools.\n\nExpand NASDAQ : MSFT Microsoft Today's Change ( 1.34 %) $ 6.52 Current Price $ 492.02 Key Data Points Market Cap $3657B Day's Range $ 486.68 - $ 492.63 52wk Range $ 344.79 - $ 555.45 Volume 489K Avg Vol 22M Gross Margin 68.76 % Dividend Yield 0.69 %\n\nThe technology is also helping companies improve their products and services, while boosting growth. For instance, CrowdStrike uses AI to enhance its cybersecurity services. Walmart is also using the technology to streamline warehouse tasks and save its workers time.\n\nFollow the money\n\nBig tech is projected to spend over $400 billion on AI infrastructure this year, and the companies involved have already told investors that they will spend even more on AI next year. Tech giants don't spend money just for the sake of it. They aim to generate positive returns on investment from every dollar. When these corporations compete against each other to throw money at AI, it's a big deal.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG 0.05%) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is investing in AI to ensure that Google's dominance in the search space remains intact as AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Grok threaten to change how people seek information online. It's also pouring capex into Google Cloud and its Waymo autonomous vehicle business, two segments with high growth potential that rests in part on AI.\n\nExpand NASDAQ : GOOG Alphabet Today's Change ( -0.05 %) $ -0.15 Current Price $ 320.13 Key Data Points Market Cap $3863B Day's Range $ 316.95 - $ 326.79 52wk Range $ 142.66 - $ 328.67 Volume 906K Avg Vol 24M Gross Margin 59.18 % Dividend Yield 0.26 %\n\nAI spending has become so massive that it's impacting U.S. gross domestic product more than consumer spending. The companies that win the AI race could end up operating autonomous vehicle fleets, selling robots that can perform any task, and offering the most competitive software. No tech giant wants to wind up in a position like Eastman Kodak found itself in when smartphones came out, and that's why they continue to spend heavily on AI.\n\nSmaller AI companies are the next opportunity\n\nAt this stage of the \"AI hype cycle,\" investors are starting to realize that there are far more AI stock opportunities than Nvidia, its hyperscaler customers, and the rest of the big tech megacaps. So instead of focusing their attention on companies that have market caps above $1 trillion, some are looking to invest in smaller companies that are benefiting from AI.\n\nThere are more of these types of opportunities than you'd expect, with most of the five best-performing S&P 500 stocks up by more than 3,000% over the past decade. That list doesn't include Tesla, Shopify, or Palantir, which have each produced remarkable returns for investors who bought early and held on.\n\nEvery year, a few stocks come along that multiply gains rapidly for patient investors. Some small companies that address AI bottlenecks and optimizations look poised to provide those types of results for long-term investors.\n\nIren (IREN 1.32%) and Cipher (CIFR +6.27%) are addressing the need for AI-capable data centers. Nuclear energy startups like NuScale (SMR +5.04%) and Oklo (OKLO +3.03%) are also gaining momentum as investors recognize that small modular reactors could play a long-term role in meeting the voracious energy appetites of AI data centers. Liquid cooling specialists and rare earth miners are among the other businesses that could produce serious long-term winners due to the AI boom.\n\nUsing artificial intelligence makes companies more competitive, and the technology has already delivered meaningful growth. And big tech's parabolic capex budgets and various case studies suggest that new AI investors aren't too late to the party.",
    "key_insights": "The current AI surge is structurally distinct from the dot-com bubble due to the immediate, demonstrated profitability, exemplified by Nvidia achieving nearly $32 billion in revenue during fiscal 2026 Q3. This cycle is fundamentally driven by competitive necessity, compelling Big Tech to allocate projected capital expenditures exceeding $400 billion this year alone, ensuring AI investments yield positive returns rather than relying purely on speculative hype.",

        "question": "Using the financial metrics provided for Broadcast.com during its acquisition by Yahoo, what was the estimated annual revenue that supported its $5.7 billion sale price?",
        "answer": "The estimated annual revenue was $100 million (or $0.1 billion). This is calculated by dividing the $5.7 billion sale price by the stated price-to-sales ratio of 57, highlighting the unprofitable nature of many participants during the dot-com era."
      },
      {
        "question": "If Big Tech's strategic imperative to avoid technological obsolescence (like Eastman Kodak) means that next year's AI infrastructure spending only meets the projected lower bound committed for the current year, what is the minimum combined capital expenditure inferred for AI infrastructure over the two-year period (this year and next)?",
        "answer": "The minimum combined capital expenditure inferred is $800 billion. This is derived by taking the projected spending of 'over $400 billion' for the current year and adding the same baseline amount for the subsequent year, as the text states they will spend 'even more' next year, making $400 billion the minimum floor for the second year."

    "context": "NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. Cramer explained why he “won’t give up” on the stock, as he commented:\n\n“On this news, NVIDIA stock has had the living daylights kicked out of it. Alphabet had been a huge client of NVIDIA, and the press clips say that it’s going to adopt its own chips far more than the ones owned by NVIDIA.

    "key_insights": "The sharp decline in NVIDIA stock (now 'ice cold') is primarily driven by immediate competitive pressure from its major client, Alphabet (Google), which is transitioning to using its own internally developed chips. This threat is amplified because Alphabet is also leveraging its new chip capacity to attract key buyers like Meta, reportedly offering its solutions at a considerable savings and directly undercutting NVIDIA's market position. Despite this serious short-term disruption, Jim Cramer maintains a strong long-term positive outlook, advising investors to 'Own, Don’t Trade' the stock.",

      {
        "question": "Based on the market actions described, what is the two-pronged competitive threat posed by Alphabet that contributes to the 'ice cold' performance of NVDA stock?",
        "answer": "The threat is twofold: First, Alphabet, a formerly 'huge client' of NVIDIA, is pivoting away from purchasing NVDA's chips by adopting its own internally developed chips, leading to a significant loss of demand. Second, Alphabet is using its new chip supply chain to become a direct competitor by selling these products to other major industry players, such as Meta, reportedly offering them at a 'considerable savings,' thereby putting immediate pricing pressure on NVIDIA’s offerings."

      {
        "question": "How does the implied risk/reward assessment provided by Jim Cramer compare structurally to the view held by the external commentary regarding the relative attractiveness of NVDA versus other opportunities in the AI sector?",
        "answer": "Cramer demonstrates confidence in NVDA's fundamental value by advising to 'Own,' suggesting a belief that the long-term reward justifies weathering the current stock turbulence. Conversely, the external commentary implies NVDA carries an unfavorable risk/reward profile compared to competitors, stating that certain alternative AI stocks offer 'greater upside potential and carry less downside risk' relative to NVIDIA."
