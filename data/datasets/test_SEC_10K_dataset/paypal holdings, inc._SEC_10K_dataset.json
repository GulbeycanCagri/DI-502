    "context": "OVERVIEW PayPal Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in January 2015 and is a leading technology platform that enables digital payments and simplifies commerce experiences on behalf of merchants and consumers worldwide. PayPal is committed to democratizing financial services to help improve the financial health of individuals and to increase economic opportunity for entrepreneurs and businesses of all sizes around the world. Our goal is to enable our merchants and consumers to manage and move their money anywhere in the world in the markets we serve, anytime, on any platform, and using any device when sending payments or getting paid, including person-to-person (“P2P”) payments. We believe that effective management of non-financial risks and opportunities, including environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) topics, helps to create value for our stakeholders and deliver on our mission and strategy. We also believe that our core values help stimulate the creativity and engagement of our global workforce to deliver products and services designed to meet the diverse needs of our customers. Unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires, references to “we,” “our,” “us,” “the Company,” or “PayPal” refer to PayPal Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. 4 PayPal’s payment solutions enable our customers to connect, transact, and send and receive payments, whether they are online or in person. We provide proprietary payment solutions accepted by merchants that enable the completion of payments on our platform on behalf of our customers. We operate a global, two-sided network at scale that connects merchants and consumers with 426 million active accounts (consisting of 391 million consumer active accounts and 35 million merchant active accounts) across approximately 200 markets as of December 31, 2023. We offer our customers the flexibility to use their PayPal or Venmo accounts to send and receive payments for goods and services, as well as the ability to transfer and withdraw funds. We enable consumers to exchange funds more safely with merchants using a variety of funding sources, which may include a bank account, a PayPal or Venmo account balance, PayPal and Venmo branded credit products including our installment products, a credit card, a debit card, certain cryptocurrencies, or other stored value products such as gift cards, and eligible rewards. Our PayPal and Venmo products also make it safer and simpler for friends and family to transfer funds to each other. We offer merchants an end-to-end payments solution that provides authorization and settlement capabilities, as well as instant access to funds and payouts. We help merchants connect with their customers, and offer tools and insights to help increase sales, power omnichannel experiences, and manage risk. We also help reduce the friction typically involved in cross-border commerce by offering consumers a simple payment experience and by enabling merchants to extend their reach to consumers in the global markets in which our services are available. We earn revenues primarily by charging fees for completing payment transactions for our customers and other payment-related services, which are typically based on the volume of activity processed on our payments platform. We also generate revenue from customers for currency conversion, for instant transfers from their PayPal or Venmo account to their bank account or debit card, and to facilitate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies; however, we generally do not charge customers to fund or draw from their accounts. We also earn revenue by providing other value-added services, which primarily comprise revenue earned through partnerships, interest and fees from our merchant and consumer credit products, interest earned on certain assets underlying customer balances, referral fees, subscription fees, and gateway services. 5 KEY PERFORMANCE METRICS We measure the scale of our platform and the relevance of our products and services to our customers through certain metrics, including total payment volume, payment transactions, and active accounts:Total payment volume (“TPV”) is the value of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions.Number of payment transactions are the total number of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions.An active account is an account registered directly with PayPal or a platform access partner that has completed a transaction on our platform, not including gateway-exclusive transactions, within the past 12 months. A platform access partner is a third party whose customers are provided access to PayPal’s platform or services through such third-party’s login credentials, including individuals and entities that utilize Hyperwallet’s payout capabilities. A user may register on our platform to access different products and may register more than one account to access a product. Accordingly, a user may have more than one active account. The number of active accounts provides management with additional perspective on the overall scale of our platform, but may not have a direct relationship to our operating results. OUR STRENGTHS Our business is built on a strong foundation designed to drive growth and differentiate us from our competitors. A critical element of our overall growth strategy involves increasing the engagement of our active accounts, which we expect will contribute to growth in payment transactions, total payment volume, and net revenues. We believe that our competitive strengths include the following:•Two-sided network—our payments platform connecting merchants and consumers enables PayPal to offer unique end-to-end product experiences designed to remove friction for consumers and drive sales conversion for merchants while gaining valuable insights into how our customers use our platform. Our payments platform provides for digital and in-store (at the point of sale) transactions while being both technology and platform agnostic.•Merchant and consumer choice—our branded and unbranded card processing payment solutions support an open ecosystem that provides choice to both merchants and consumers, enabling flexibility to make and receive payments using a wide variety of different funding options and digital wallet solutions. 6 •Scale—our global scale helps us to drive organic growth. As of December 31, 2023, we had 426 million active accounts, consisting of 391 million consumer active accounts and 35 million merchant active accounts in approximately 200 markets around the world. A market is a geographic area or political jurisdiction, such as a country, territory, or protectorate, in which we offer some or all of our products and services. A country, territory, or protectorate is identified by a distinct set of laws and regulations. In 2023, we processed $1.53 trillion of TPV.•Trusted brands—we have built and strengthened well-recognized and trusted brands, including PayPal, Braintree, and Venmo. Our communications and marketing efforts across multiple geographies and demographic groups play an important role in building brand visibility, usage, and overall preference among customers. •Risk and compliance management—our enterprise risk and compliance management program is designed to help keep customer information secure and ensure we process legitimate transactions around the world, while identifying and minimizing illegal, high-risk, or fraudulent transactions.•Regulatory licenses—we believe that our regulatory licenses, which enable us to operate in markets around the world, are a distinct advantage and help support business growth. MERCHANT AND CONSUMER PAYMENT SOLUTIONS In late 2023, we reorganized our operations to be more closely aligned to the customers we serve—consumers, small businesses, and large enterprises—and to help enable our teams to deliver more seamless and differentiated end-to-end experiences. Merchant value proposition We partner with our merchants to help grow and expand their businesses by providing global reach and powering all aspects of digital checkout. We offer alternative payment methods including access to credit solutions, provide fraud prevention and risk management solutions, reduce merchant losses through proprietary protection programs, and offer tools and insights for utilizing data analytics to help merchants attract and engage customers and improve sales conversion. We employ a technology and platform agnostic approach intended to enable merchants of all sizes to quickly and easily provide digital checkout online, including through PayPal-branded checkout and unbranded card processing (primarily consisting of Braintree), as well as in person at the point of sale, across all platforms and devices, and to securely and simply receive payments from their customers. 7 PayPal’s payments platform enables merchants to accept all types of online and in person payments, including those made with the PayPal and Venmo digital wallets, our consumer credit products, credit cards and debit cards, and competing digital wallets, as well as other popular local payment methods. Our diversified suite of products and services is tailored to meet the needs of merchants regardless of their size or business complexity. We offer a seamless, omnichannel solution that helps merchants manage and grow their business. By offering simplified and personalized shopping experiences for consumers, we help merchants drive increased engagement and sales conversion.We offer access to merchant financing products for eligible small and medium-sized businesses through the PayPal Working Capital and PayPal Business Loan products, which we collectively refer to as our merchant financing solutions. The PayPal Working Capital product allows businesses to access a loan or cash advance for a fixed fee, based on their annual payment volume processed by PayPal. The PayPal Business Loan product provides businesses with access to short-term financing for a fixed fee or interest based on an evaluation of both the applying business as well as the business owner. In the United States (“U.S.”), these products are provided under a program agreement with an independent chartered financial institution. We believe that our merchant financing solutions enable us to deepen our engagement with our existing small and medium-sized merchants and expand services to new merchants by providing access to capital that may not be available from traditional banks or other lenders. We generate revenues from merchants primarily by charging fees for completing their payment transactions and other payment-related services. We also earn revenues from interest and fees earned on our merchant loans receivables. Consumer value proposition We focus on providing affordable, convenient, and secure consumer financial products and services intended to facilitate the management and movement of money. We provide consumers with a digital wallet that enables them to send payments to merchants more safely using a variety of funding sources, which may include a bank account, a PayPal or Venmo account balance, our consumer credit products, a credit card, a debit card, certain cryptocurrencies, or other stored value products such as gift cards, and eligible rewards. Our goal is to create the simplest checkout experience possible for consumers both online and on mobile devices.We also offer consumers P2P payment solutions for domestic and international transfers through our PayPal, Venmo, and Xoom products and services. Our Venmo digital wallet in the U.S. is a leading mobile application used to move money between our customers and to make purchases at select merchants. Our Xoom international money transfer service enables our customers to send money to people around the world in a secure, fast, and cost-effective way. P2P is an important source of customer engagement and also serves as a customer acquisition channel that facilitates organic growth by enabling potential users to establish active accounts with PayPal or Venmo at the time they make or receive a P2P payment. We also focus on simplifying and personalizing shopping experiences for our consumers by offering tools for product discovery, price tracking, saving through deals and offers, convenient package tracking, and redemption of shopping rewards, which help our merchants to increase consumer engagement and sales conversion.We offer credit products to eligible consumers in certain markets as a funding source at checkout. Our consumer credit offerings include our buy now, pay later products in the U.S., United Kingdom (“U.K.”), France, and Germany, among other markets, and in Japan through our Paidy brand. A key attribute of our buy now, pay later products is the absence of interest or consumer late fees for missed payments in most of the geographies where we offer them. Further, we offer interest-bearing installment products for consumers in the U.S. (issued by an independent chartered financial institution) and in Germany. In the U.S., consumers may apply for our PayPal- and Venmo-branded consumer credit cards and our PayPal Credit revolving consumer credit product, which are offered through a partnership with an independent chartered financial institution. We offer a PayPal-issued PayPal Credit product in the U.K. We believe that our consumer credit products help us to increase engagement with consumers and merchants on our two-sided network. We have expanded our consumer value proposition through enhancements to the PayPal and Venmo digital wallets, which provide functionality to enable consumers to more easily check out, explore deals and offers, track and redeem rewards, and to transact with certain cryptocurrencies, including buying, holding, selling, sending, and receiving them in certain markets. Our goal is to drive increased consumer engagement by providing consumers with a wide range of services to manage their finances and enhance their ability to shop online and in person.We generate revenue from consumers from: foreign currency conversions, instant transfers from their PayPal or Venmo account to their bank account or debit card, and facilitating the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies; interest, fees, or other revenue from our credit products; and other miscellaneous fees. 8 PROTECTING MERCHANTS AND CONSUMERS Protecting merchants and consumers on our payments platform from financial and fraud loss is important to successfully compete and sustainably grow our business. Fraudulent activities, such as account takeover, identity theft (including stolen financial information), and malicious activities by counterparties, represent a significant risk to merchants and consumers, as well as their payment partners. In addition to the protections afforded by applicable law, we provide merchants and consumers with protection programs for certain purchase transactions completed on our payments platform. Our protection programs help protect both merchants and consumers from financial loss resulting from, among other things, counterparty non-performance. These programs are designed to promote confidence on the part of both consumers, who will not be required to pay in certain circumstances, such as not receiving their purchased item in the condition significantly as described, and merchants, who will receive payment for delivering an item to the customer. We believe that these programs are generally consistent with or broader than protections provided by other participants in the payments industry.Our ability to help protect both merchants and consumers is based largely on our proprietary, end-to-end payments platform and our ability to utilize the data from both sides of transactions on our two-sided network, specifically from buyers and sellers and from senders and receivers of payments. Our ongoing investment in systems and processes is designed to enhance the safety and security of our products and reflects our goal of having PayPal recognized as one of the world’s most trusted payments brands. COMPETITION The global payments industry is highly competitive, dynamic, highly innovative, and increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny and oversight. Many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with innovative and disruptive technologies, shifting user preferences and needs, price sensitivity of merchants and consumers, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Competition also may intensify as new competitors emerge, businesses combine or enter into new partnerships, and established companies in other segments expand to become competitive with various aspects of our business.Our business faces competition from a wide range of businesses and from all forms of physical and electronic payments. We face competition from banks and financial institutions, which provide traditional payment methods (particularly credit cards and debit cards (collectively, “payment cards”), electronic bank transfers, credit, and installment methods), payment networks that facilitate payments for payment cards or proprietary retail networks, payment card processors, and “card on file” services. We also face competition from providers offering a variety of payment products and services, including tokenized and contactless payment cards, digital wallets and mobile payments solutions, credit, installment or other buy now pay later methods, real-time payment systems, P2P payments and money remittance services, card readers and other devices or technologies for payment at point of sale (such as contactless cards, tokenized cards, Near Field Communication (NFC) based solutions, and Quick Response (QR) code based solutions), virtual currencies (such as cryptocurrencies and stablecoins) and distributed ledger technologies, and tools that simplify and personalize shopping experiences for consumers and merchants. Our products and services also face competition from paper-based payments (primarily cash and checks).We differentiate ourselves to merchants through our ability to innovate and develop products and services that offer new payment experiences for our merchants, demonstrate that they may achieve incremental sales by using and offering our services to consumers, and support transactions on our payments platform across varied technologies and payment methods; through the simplicity and transparency of our fee structure; and through our seller protection programs, analytics, and risk management, as well as other merchant services. In addition, we differentiate ourselves to consumers through our broad acceptance and the ability to use our products and services across multiple commerce channels, including e-commerce, mobile, and in person payments, and without sharing their financial information with the merchant or any other party they are paying; our customer service, dispute resolution, and purchase protection programs; and our ability to simplify and personalize shopping experiences. We invest resources towards improving our products and services and expanding their acceptance, offering choice in payment options, providing excellent customer service, and building brands that merchants and consumers trust.In addition to the discussion in this section, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” under the caption “We face substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry” for further discussion of the potential impact of competition on our business. 9 STRATEGY Our ability to grow revenue is affected by, among other things, the macroeconomic environment and its impact on consumer spending patterns, adoption of digital payment methods, the expansion of multiple commerce channels, the growth of mobile devices and merchant and consumer applications on those devices, the growth of merchants and consumers globally with internet and mobile access, the pace of transition from cash and checks to digital forms of payment, our share of digital payments, and our ability to innovate and introduce new products, services, and features that merchants and consumers value. Our strategy to drive growth in our business includes the following:•Growing our core business: through expanding our global capabilities, customer base and scale, increasing our customers’ engagement with our products and services by better addressing their everyday needs to access, manage, and move money, creating seamless checkout experiences, and expanding the adoption of our solutions by merchants and consumers;•Expanding our value proposition for merchants and consumers: by being technology- and platform- agnostic, partnering with our merchants to grow and expand their business online and in person, including offering merchants risk management and seller protection programs, and providing consumers with simple, secure, and flexible ways to manage and move money across different markets, merchants, and platforms, including offering buyer protection programs and simplifying their shopping experiences; •Forming and expanding strategic partnerships: by building new strategic partnerships and deepening existing ones to provide better experiences for our customers, offer greater choice and flexibility, acquire new customers, and reinforce our role in the payments ecosystem; and•Seeking new areas of growth: by focusing on innovation in both the digital and physical worlds and finding opportunities to expand and improve upon our existing products and capabilities. TECHNOLOGY Our payments platform utilizes a combination of proprietary and third-party technologies and services intended to facilitate transactions efficiently and securely between millions of merchants and consumers worldwide across different channels, markets, and networks. Our payments platform connects with financial services providers around the world and allows consumers to make purchases using a wide range of payment methods, regardless of where a merchant is located. Consumers who use our payments platform can send payments in approximately 200 markets around the world and in approximately 150 currencies, withdraw funds to their bank accounts in 56 currencies, and hold balances in their PayPal accounts in 24 currencies. We have developed intuitive user interfaces, customer tools, transaction management databases, and payment network integrations on our platform designed to enable our customers to utilize our suite of products and services. Our payments platform, open application programming interfaces, and developer tools are designed to enable developers to innovate with ease and offer robust solutions to our global ecosystem of merchants and consumers, while at the same time helping to maintain the security of our customers’ information. The technology infrastructure supporting our payments platform is designed to simplify the storage and processing of large amounts of data and facilitate the deployment and operation of large-scale global products and services in both our own data centers and when hosted by third-party cloud service providers. Our technology infrastructure is designed around industry best practices intended to reduce downtime and help ensure the resiliency of our payments platform in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences. Our payments platform incorporates multiple layers of protection for business continuity and system redundancy purposes and to help mitigate cybersecurity risks. We have a comprehensive cybersecurity program designed to protect our technology infrastructure and payments platform against cybersecurity threats, which includes regularly testing our systems to identify and address potential vulnerabilities. We strive to continually improve our technology infrastructure and payments platform to enhance the customer experience and to increase efficiency, scalability, and security. For additional information regarding risks relating to our technology infrastructure and cybersecurity, see the information in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” under the captions “Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to our reputation, business, and financial condition” and “Business interruptions or systems failures may impair the availability of our websites, applications, products or services, or otherwise harm our business.” 10 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Our total research and development expense was $1.6 billion, $1.7 billion, and $1.6 billion in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY The protection of our intellectual property, including our trademarks, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, patents, and trade secrets, is important to the success of our business. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on applicable laws, regulations, and administrative procedures in the U.S. and internationally. We have registered our core brands as domain names and as trademarks in the U.S. and many international jurisdictions. We also have an active program to secure and enforce trademarks and domain names that correspond to our brands in markets of interest. We have filed and continue to file patent applications in the U.S. and in international jurisdictions covering certain aspects of our proprietary technology and new innovations. We also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights when offering or procuring products and services. We routinely enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and non-disclosure agreements with parties with whom we conduct business to control access to, and use and disclosure of, our proprietary information.For additional information regarding risks relating to our intellectual property, see the information in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” under the captions “Third parties may allege that we are infringing their patents and other intellectual property rights” and “We may be unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property.” GOVERNMENT REGULATION We operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened focus by regulators globally on all aspects of the payments industry, including anti-money laundering, countering terrorist financing, privacy, cybersecurity, and consumer protection. The laws and regulations applicable to us, including those enacted prior to the advent of digital payments, continue to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation. New or changing laws and regulations, including changes to their interpretation and implementation, as well as increased penalties and enforcement actions related to non-compliance, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We monitor these areas closely and are focused on designing compliant solutions for our customers.Government regulation impacts key aspects of our business. We are subject to the laws and regulations applicable to the payments industry in the markets we operate, which are subject to interpretation and change.Payments regulation. Various laws and regulations govern the payments industry in the U.S. and internationally. In the U.S., PayPal, Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary) holds licenses to operate as a money transmitter (or its equivalent) in the states where such licenses are required, as well as in the District of Columbia and certain territories. These licenses include not only our PayPal-branded products and services, but also our Venmo, Hyperwallet, and Xoom products and services, to the extent offered in these locations. As a licensed money transmitter, PayPal is subject to, among other requirements, restrictions on the investment of customer funds, reporting requirements, bonding requirements, and inspection by state regulatory agencies. In certain cases, these licenses also generally cover PayPal’s service enabling customers to buy, hold, transfer, and sell cryptocurrency directly from their PayPal or Venmo account. In the State of New York, PayPal holds a full Bitlicense issued by the New York Department of Financial Services to offer cryptocurrency services in the state. Outside the U.S., we provide similar services customized for various countries and foreign jurisdictions through our foreign subsidiaries. The activities of those non-U.S. entities are, or may be, supervised by a financial regulatory authority in the jurisdictions in which they operate. Among other regulatory authorities, the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (the “CSSF”), the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, the People’s Bank of China, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Reserve Bank of India, the Central Bank of Russia, and the Central Bank of Brazil have asserted jurisdiction over some or all of our activities in their respective jurisdictions. This list is not exhaustive, and there are numerous other regulatory agencies which have asserted or may assert jurisdiction over our activities.In addition, financial services regulators in various jurisdictions, including the U.S. and the European Union (“EU”), have implemented authentication requirements for banks and payment processors intended to reduce online fraud, which could impose significant costs, make it more difficult for new customers to open PayPal accounts, and reduce the ease of use of our products. 11 Financial Services supervision. We serve our customers in the U.K. through PayPal U.K. Limited (“PayPal U.K.”), a wholly-owned subsidiary that is subject to regulation as an electronic money institution in the U.K. by the FCA. PayPal U.K. is authorized and regulated by the FCA from November 1, 2023. We serve our customers in the EU (and the U.K. through October 31, 2023) through PayPal (Europe) S.à.r.l. et Cie, S.C.A. (“PayPal (Europe)”), a wholly-owned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a credit institution in Luxembourg by the CSSF. Accordingly, we must comply with rules and regulations of the U.K. and European banking industry, including those related to capitalization, funds management, corporate governance, anti-money laundering, disclosure, reporting, and inspection. We are, or may be, subject to banking-related regulations in other countries now or in the future related to our role in the financial industry. In addition, based on our relationships with our partner financial institutions, we are, or may be, subject to indirect regulation and examination by the regulators of these partner financial institutions.Lending regulation. Our U.S. consumer short-term, interest-free, installment product is subject to federal and state laws governing consumer credit and debt collection, and PayPal holds multiple state licenses as the lender for this product. Paidy, Inc. holds multiple licenses for the issuance of its consumer installment products in Japan and is registered with the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry as a Comprehensive Credit Purchase Intermediary. In Australia, PayPal Credit Pty Limited offers a consumer short-term, interest-free, installment product that is exempt from regulation by the primary consumer credit legislation, but is subject to other laws which cover the provision of financial services, credit reporting, debt collection, and privacy. PayPal’s consumer short-term, interest-free, installment products in the U.K., France, Germany, Spain, and Italy are generally exempt from primary consumer credit legislation; however, certain consumer lending laws, consumer protection, and banking transparency regulations apply to this activity. Our U.S. consumer interest-bearing installment product is subject to federal and state laws and is offered by an independent chartered financial institution. PayPal’s interest-bearing installment product for consumers in Germany is subject to applicable local laws such as consumer (lending) laws, consumer protection, or banking transparency regulations. These loans are originated by PayPal (Europe). PayPal and Venmo co-branded consumer credit cards and the PayPal Credit revolving consumer credit product are issued by an independent chartered financial institution in the U.S., and are subject to laws and regulations governing these programs. PayPal Credit in the U.K. is a regulated, revolving consumer credit product subject to applicable local laws and regulations.Our U.S. merchant lending products are subject to federal and state regulations and are offered by an independent chartered financial institution. Our merchant lending products offered in Germany and France are subject to the laws of Luxembourg and certain local laws, and our merchant lending product offered in the U.K. is subject to U.K. regulation. The loans offered to European and U.K. merchants are originated by PayPal (Europe) and PayPal U.K., respectively. Our merchant lending product in Australia is subject to the laws of Australia and originated by PayPal Credit Pty Limited.Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). The CFPB has significant authority to regulate consumer financial products in the U.S., including consumer credit, deposits, payments, and similar products. As a larger market participant of remittance transfers, we are subject to the direct supervisory authority of the CFPB. The CFPB and similar regulatory agencies in other jurisdictions may have broad consumer protection mandates that could result in the promulgation and interpretation of rules and regulations that may affect our business. Anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, and sanctions. PayPal is subject to anti-money laundering (“AML”) laws and regulations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, as well as laws designed to prevent the use of the financial systems to facilitate terrorist activities. Our AML program is designed to prevent our payments platform from being used to facilitate money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit activities, or to do business in countries or with persons and entities included on designated country or person lists promulgated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls and equivalent authorities in other countries. Our AML and sanctions compliance programs, overseen by our AML/Bank Secrecy Act Officer, are composed of policies, procedures, and internal controls, and are designed to address these legal and regulatory requirements and assist in managing money laundering and terrorist financing risks.Interchange fees. Interchange fees (the transaction fees for processing credit and debit card transactions) are subject to regulation in certain jurisdictions. For example, in the EU, the Multilateral Interchange Fee Regulation caps interchange fees and provides for business rules to be complied with by any company dealing with payment card transactions. Interchange fees are being reviewed or challenged in various jurisdictions. As a result, the fees that we collect in certain jurisdictions may become the subject of regulatory challenge. 12 Data protection and privacy. We are subject to a number of laws, rules, directives, and regulations (“privacy and data protection laws”) relating to the collection, use, retention, security, processing, and transfer (collectively, “processing”) of personally identifiable information about our customers, our merchants’ customers, and employees (“personal data”) in the countries where we operate. Our business relies on the processing of personal data in many jurisdictions and the movement of data across national borders. As a result, much of the personal data that we process, which may include certain financial information associated with individuals, is subject to one or more privacy and data protection laws in one or more jurisdictions. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between or among us, our subsidiaries, and other parties with which we have commercial relationships.Regulatory scrutiny of privacy, data protection, cybersecurity practices, and the processing of personal data is increasing around the world. Regulatory authorities are continuously considering numerous legislative and regulatory proposals and interpretive guidelines that may contain additional privacy and data protection obligations. Many jurisdictions in which we operate have adopted, or are in the process of adopting or amending data privacy legislation or regulation aimed at creating and enhancing individual privacy rights. In addition, the interpretation and application of these privacy and data protection laws in the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere are subject to change and may subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny and business costs.Anti-corruption. PayPal is subject to applicable anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Anti-corruption laws generally prohibit offering, promising, giving, accepting, or authorizing others to provide anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to or from a government official or private party in order to influence official action or otherwise gain an unfair business advantage, such as to obtain or retain business. We have implemented policies, procedures, and internal controls that are designed to comply with these laws and regulations.Additional regulatory developments. Various regulatory agencies continue to examine and implement laws governing a wide variety of issues, including virtual currencies, identity theft, account management guidelines, disclosure rules, cybersecurity, competition, and marketing, which may impact PayPal’s business. Certain governments around the world are adopting laws and regulations pertaining to ESG performance, transparency, and reporting, including those related to general corporate ESG disclosures (e.g., the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive) as well as topical reporting and risk management disclosure requirements, such as obligations related to disclosure of the management of climate-related risks.For an additional discussion on governmental regulation affecting our business, please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” included in this Form 10-K. ESG MANAGEMENT PayPal is committed to creating a more inclusive global economy and advancing our core values of Inclusion, Innovation, Collaboration, and Wellness across our communities, workforce, and strategies. We manage priority ESG risks and opportunities organized across responsible business practices, employees and culture, social innovation, and environmental sustainability. We believe this integrated, enterprise-wide approach to managing our global business responsibly helps to enable us to create value for our stakeholders, including our stockholders, employees, partners, and communities. We continue to advance and prioritize efforts to manage key non-financial factors critical to our long-term business, including further enhancements to support the safety and security of our products and platform, ongoing programmatic development intended to foster an inclusive culture across the employee experience, and progress on our science-based approach to reducing our climate change impacts. We take this commitment seriously and endeavor to provide transparent disclosures on our progress through our annual Global Impact Report and other communications. HUMAN CAPITAL At PayPal, we consider the management of our global talent (human capital) to be essential to the ongoing success of our business. As of December 31, 2023, we employed approximately 27,200 people globally, with 45% in the Americas, 42% in Asia-Pacific, and 13% in Europe and the Middle East. Our global employees work predominantly full-time and represent 144 nationalities, across 27 countries, including approximately 10,200 located in the U.S. 13 Attracting, recruiting, developing, and retaining diverse talent enables us to provide our customers with products and services that help them to thrive in the global economy. In 2023, we continued to build employee awareness and engagement in our leadership principles, which were launched in 2022, to establish a common set of expectations for all employees. We continued to integrate these principles across our global talent strategy to help shape our programs throughout the employee lifecycle and achieve key business priorities. A year after launch, 78% of employees responding to a global survey reported that the leadership principles are now part of their day-to-day work. We also remain focused on promoting the physical, mental, and financial wellness of our employees, particularly as our workforce continues to navigate changes in where and how we work and operate in a dynamic and competitive environment. Employee engagement We use employee feedback to directly inform the ongoing development of our employee programs. In addition to administering an annual survey to gather input from our global workforce, we also conducted specific surveys to gather direct employee feedback on our specific topics. This year, our 2023 annual employee survey was conducted in September, between the announcement of the appointment of Alex Chriss as PayPal’s new CEO and his assumption of the role. We heard from 82% of our global employees. Our engagement score, which reflects whether employees would recommend PayPal to their peers and/or are happy at PayPal, was 77%. Our score measuring intent to stay was 77%, which reflects an employee’s expectation to remain employed with the company in two years. Talent acquisition, development, and retention As a leading technology platform that enables digital payments and simplifies commerce experiences, we compete for top global talent around the world. We believe that a strong culture focused on employee experiences that enables advancement, learning, and individual career insights is essential to the successful acquisition, development, and retention of diverse talent. Accordingly, we have implemented programs focused on inclusive hiring practices and extending our talent pipeline through targeted partnerships, revise our career development program for individuals and managers, extended individual coaching and mentorship programs (particularly for technical and underrepresented talent), and advanced efforts for employees to grow through self-paced and community learning experiences. Employee wellness We remain focused on promoting the holistic well-being of our employees, including resources, programs, and services to support our employees’ physical, mental, and financial wellness. Benefits include Global Wellness Days for all employees, resources to foster emotional well-being, and providing workplace flexibility through Crisis Leave and other programs. We promote employee financial wellness, including by offering individual employee financial coaching. Through our global Community Impact program, we support our employees’ individual passions and communities by matching eligible employee donations and volunteer time with non-profit organizations up to $2,500 annually per employee. Diversity, inclusion, equity, and belonging We believe that fostering diversity, inclusion, equity, and belonging (“DIE&B”) is critical to our global talent strategy and pivotal to building a culture that embraces individual characteristics, values diversity, minimizes barriers, and enhances feelings of security and support across the workplace. We are committed to equal pay for equal work and promoting enterprise-wide inclusive learning opportunities. We believe that our strong commitment to DIE&B is evident at all levels of the organization from our Board of Directors to our executive leadership team to our global workforce. As of December 31, 2023, 46% of our Board and 75% of our senior leadership team identified as women and/or from a diverse ethnic group. Across our workforce, we reached 55% overall diverse workforce representation, including 43% global gender diversity (inclusive of self-identified women and non-binary employees) and 54% U.S. ethnic diversity, as of December 31, 2023. Additional U.S. workforce diversity metrics can be found in our public EEO-1 reports and annual Global Impact Report available at https://about.pypl.com/values-in-action/reporting/default.aspx. 14 Workforce representation is only one aspect of our broader DIE&B strategy. In 2023, we continued our support for underrepresented communities and employees, including through activities such as inclusion-focused employee learning modules and our enterprise-wide sponsorship program. We continue to evaluate DIE&B progress across the company and as part of the individual performance assessment under our 2023 annual incentive plan for our senior executives. In addition, we empower eight employee resource groups, which are open to all employees, to promote community and belonging for employees that identify as Black, Latinx/Hispanic, women, interfaith, veterans, LGBTQ+, Asian, and disabled persons and their allies. Our evolving workplace We remain focused on creating a culture of flexibility and community by designing ways to collaborate across diverse workplace models, whether working virtually, on-site, or using a hybrid approach. We empower functional leadership to determine the most appropriate workplace strategy for their teams to optimize employee productivity and engagement and deliver on business priorities. Across PayPal, we are focused on providing tools and resources to support our diverse and distributed teams. We believe this flexible approach has broadened our potential global talent pools.

RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, in addition to other information appearing in this Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, for important information regarding risks and uncertainties that could affect us. These risk factors do not identify all risks we face, and additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, future prospects, and the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected. CYBERSECURITY AND TECHNOLOGY RISKS Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to our reputation, business, and financial condition. The techniques used to attempt to obtain unauthorized or illegal access to systems and information (including customers’ personal data), disable or degrade service, exploit vulnerabilities, or sabotage systems are constantly evolving. In some circumstances, these attempts may not be recognized or detected until after they have been launched against a target. Unauthorized parties will continue to attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means, including through hacking into our systems or facilities or those of our customers, partners, or vendors, and attempting to fraudulently induce users of our systems (including employees, vendor and partner personnel and customers) into disclosing user names, passwords, payment card information, multi-factor authentication application access or other sensitive information used to gain access to such systems or facilities. This information may, in turn, be used to access our customers’ confidential personal or proprietary information and financial instrument data that are stored on or accessible through our information technology systems and those of third parties with whom we partner. This information may also be used to execute fraudulent transactions or otherwise engage in fraudulent actions. Numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats, including advanced and persisting cyberattacks, cyberextortion, distributed denial-of-service attacks, ransomware, spear phishing and social engineering schemes, the introduction of computer viruses or other malware, and the physical destruction of all or portions of our information technology and infrastructure and those of third parties with whom we partner or that are part of our information technology supply chain, are becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex, may be difficult to detect, and could compromise the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the data in our systems, as well as the systems themselves. We believe that hostile actors, who may comprise individuals, coordinated groups, sophisticated organizations, or nation state supported entities may target PayPal due to our name, brand recognition, types of data (including sensitive payments- and identity-related data) that customers provide to us, and the widespread adoption and use of our products and services. We have experienced from time to time, and may experience in the future, cybersecurity incidents, including breaches of our security measures, network breaches, and compromise of personally identifiable customer information due to human error, deception, malfeasance, insider threats, system errors, defects, vulnerabilities, or other issues.Any cybersecurity incidents, including cyberattacks or data security breaches affecting the information technology or infrastructure of companies we acquire or of our customers, partners, or vendors (including data center and cloud computing providers) could have similar negative effects. Under payment card network rules and our contracts with our payment processors, if there is a breach of payment card information stored by us or our direct payment card processing vendors, we could be liable to the payment card issuing banks, including for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses. Cybersecurity breaches and other exploited security vulnerabilities could subject us to significant costs and third-party liabilities, result in improper disclosure of data and violations of applicable privacy and other laws, require us to change our business practices, cause us to incur significant remediation costs, lead to loss of customer confidence in, or decreased use of, our products and services, damage our reputation and brands, divert the attention of management from the operation of our business, result in significant compensation or contractual penalties from us to our customers and their business partners as a result of losses to or claims by them, or expose us to litigation, regulatory investigations, and significant fines and penalties. While we maintain insurance policies intended to help offset the financial impact we may experience from these risks, our coverage may be insufficient to compensate us for all losses caused by security breaches and other damage to or unavailability of our systems. Business interruptions or systems failures may impair the availability of our websites, applications, products or services, or otherwise harm our business. Our systems and operations and those of our service providers and partners have experienced from time to time, and may experience in the future, business interruptions or degradation of service because of distributed denial-of-service and other cyberattacks, insider threats, hardware and software defects or malfunctions, human error, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, 16 and other natural disasters, public health crises (including pandemics), power losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist attacks, computer viruses or other malware, or other events. The frequency and intensity of weather events related to climate change are increasing, which could increase the likelihood and severity of such disasters as well as related damage and business interruption. Our corporate headquarters are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a seismically active region in California. A catastrophic event that could lead to a disruption or failure of our systems or operations could result in significant losses and require substantial recovery time and significant expenditures to resume or maintain operations. Further, some of our systems, including those of companies that we have acquired, are not fully redundant and any failure of these acquired systems, including due to a catastrophic event, may lead to operational outages or delays. While we engage in disaster recovery planning and testing intended to mitigate risks from outages or delays, our planning and testing may not be sufficient for all possible outcomes or events. As a provider of payments solutions, we are also subject to heightened scrutiny by regulators that may require specific business continuity, resiliency and disaster recovery plans, and rigorous testing of such plans, which may be costly and time-consuming to implement, and may divert our resources from other business priorities. Any of the foregoing risks could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, system failures, cyberattacks, unplanned outages, and other events or conditions from time to time that have and may interrupt the availability, or reduce or adversely affect the speed or functionality, of our products and services. A prolonged interruption of, or reduction in, the availability, speed, or functionality of our products and services could materially harm our business. Frequent or persistent interruptions in our services could permanently harm our relationship with our customers and partners and our reputation. If any system failure or similar event results in damage to our customers or their business partners, they could seek significant compensation or contractual penalties from us for their losses. These claims, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and costly for us to address.We continue to undertake system upgrades and re-platforming efforts designed to improve the availability, reliability, resiliency, and speed of our payments platform. These efforts are costly and time-consuming, involve significant technical complexity and risk, may divert our resources from new features and products, and may ultimately not be effective. Frequent or persistent site interruptions could lead to regulatory scrutiny, significant fines and penalties, and mandatory and costly changes to our business practices, and ultimately could cause us to lose existing licenses that we need to operate or prevent or delay us from obtaining additional licenses that may be required for our business.We also rely on facilities, components, applications, software, and services supplied by third parties, including data center facilities and cloud data storage and processing services. From time to time, we have experienced interruptions in the provision of such facilities and services provided by these third parties. If these third parties experience operational interference or disruptions (including a cybersecurity incident), fail to perform their obligations, or breach their agreements with us, our operations could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected, which could result in customer dissatisfaction, regulatory scrutiny, and damage to our reputation and brands, and materially and adversely affect our business. While we maintain insurance policies intended to help offset the financial impact we may experience from these risks, our coverage may be insufficient to compensate us for all losses caused by interruptions in our service due to systems failures and similar events.In addition, any failure to successfully implement new information systems and technologies, or improvements or upgrades to existing information systems and technologies in a timely manner could adversely impact our business, internal controls, results of operations, and financial condition. If we cannot keep pace with rapid technological developments to provide new and innovative products and services, the use of our products and services and, consequently, our revenues, could decline. Rapid, significant, and disruptive technological changes impact the industries in which we operate, including payment technologies (including real-time payments, payment card tokenization, virtual currencies, distributed ledger and blockchain technologies, and proximity payment technology such as Near Field Communication and other contactless payments); internet browser technologies, that enable users to easily store their payment card information for use on any retail or e-commerce website; artificial intelligence and machine learning; developments in technologies supporting our regulatory and compliance obligations; and in-store, digital, and social commerce.We expect that new technologies applicable to the industries in which we operate will continue to emerge and may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies we currently use in our products and services. We cannot predict the effects of technological changes on our business, which technological developments or innovations will become widely adopted, and how those technologies may be regulated. Developing and incorporating new technologies into new and existing products and services may require significant investment, take considerable time, and may not ultimately be successful. We rely in part on 17 third parties, including some of our competitors, for the development of and access to new or evolving technologies. These third parties may restrict or prevent our access to, or utilization of, those technologies, as well as their platforms or products. Our ability to develop, provide or incorporate new technologies and adapt our existing products and services or develop future and new products and services using new technologies may be limited or restricted by industry-wide standards, platform providers, payments networks, changes to laws and regulations, changing customer expectations, third-party intellectual property rights, and other factors. If we are unable to develop and incorporate new technologies and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards in a timely or cost-effective manner, our business could be harmed. LEGAL, REGULATORY AND COMPLIANCE RISKS Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight. Our failure to comply with extensive, complex, overlapping, and frequently changing rules, regulations, and legal interpretations could materially harm our business. Our business is subject to complex and changing laws, rules, regulations, policies, and legal interpretations in the markets in which we offer services directly or through partners, including, but not limited to, those governing: banking, credit, deposit taking, cross-border and domestic money transmission, prepaid access, foreign currency exchange, privacy, data protection, data governance, cybersecurity, banking secrecy, digital payments, cryptocurrency, payment services (including payment processing and settlement services), lending, fraud detection, consumer protection, antitrust and competition, economic and trade sanctions, anti-money laundering, and counter-terrorist financing.Regulators and legislators globally have been establishing, evolving, and increasing their regulatory authority, oversight, and enforcement in a manner that impacts our business. As we introduce new products and services and expand into new markets, including through acquisitions, we expect to become subject to additional regulations, restrictions, and licensing requirements. As we expand and localize our international activities, we expect that our obligations in the markets in which we operate will continue to increase. In addition, because we facilitate sales of goods and provide services to customers worldwide, one or more jurisdictions may claim that we or our customers are required to comply with their laws, which may impose different, more specific, or conflicting obligations on us, as well as broader liability. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or new laws, regulations, or orders of any government authority (including changes to or expansion of their interpretation) may subject us to significant fines, penalties, criminal and civil lawsuits, forfeiture of significant assets, and enforcement actions in one or more jurisdictions; result in additional compliance and licensure requirements; cause us to lose existing licenses or prevent or delay us from obtaining additional licenses that may be required for our business; increase regulatory scrutiny of our business; divert management’s time and attention from our business; restrict our operations; lead to increased friction for customers; force us to make changes to our business practices, products, or operations; require us to engage in remediation activities; or delay planned transactions, product launches, or improvements. Any of the foregoing could, individually or in the aggregate, harm our reputation, damage our brands and business, and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The complexity of U.S. federal and state and international regulatory and enforcement regimes, coupled with the global scope of our operations and the evolving global regulatory environment, could result in a single event prompting a large number of overlapping investigations and legal and regulatory proceedings by multiple government authorities in different jurisdictions. While we have implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, and agents will not violate such laws and regulations. Payments Regulation In the U.S., PayPal, Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary) holds licenses to operate as a money transmitter (or its equivalent) in the states where such licenses are required, as well as in the District of Columbia and certain territories. If we fail to comply with applicable laws or regulations required to maintain our licenses, we could be subject to liability and/or additional restrictions, forced to cease doing business with residents of certain states or territories, forced to change our business practices, or required to obtain additional licenses or regulatory approvals, which could impose substantial costs and harm our business. While we currently allow our customers to send payments from approximately 200 markets, we allow customers in only approximately half of those markets (including the U.S.) to also receive payments, in some cases with significant restrictions on the manner in which customers can hold balances or withdraw funds. These restrictions may limit our ability to grow our business.Outside of the U.S., we principally provide our services to customers in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) through PayPal (Europe) S.à.r.l. et Cie, S.C.A. (“PayPal (Europe)”), our wholly-owned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a credit institution in Luxembourg and PayPal U.K. Limited (“PayPal U.K.”), a wholly-owned subsidiary that is subject to 18 regulation as an electronic money institution in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) by the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”). PayPal (Europe) or PayPal U.K. may be subject to enforcement actions and significant fines if either violates applicable requirements. If the business activities of PayPal (Europe) exceed certain thresholds, or if the European Central Bank (“ECB”) so determines, PayPal (Europe) may be deemed a significant supervised entity and certain activities of PayPal (Europe) would become directly supervised by the ECB, rather than by the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier. PayPal (Europe) is also subject to regulation by the ECB under the oversight framework for electronic payment instruments, schemes and arrangements (PISA). Compliance with applicable laws and regulations could become more costly and operationally difficult to manage due to additional supervision, potentially inconsistent interpretations, and domestic regulations by various countries in the region. Applicable regulation relating to payments, anti-money laundering, and digital services, which are key focus areas of regulators and subject to extensive new regulation, could subject us to additional and complex obligations, risks, and associated costs, and impact our ability to expand our business in Europe.In many of the other markets outside the U.S. in which we do business, we serve our customers through PayPal Pte. Ltd., our wholly-owned subsidiary based in Singapore. PayPal Pte. Ltd. is supervised by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”). As of July 1, 2023, PayPal Pte. Ltd. has been issued a Major Payment Institution license by the MAS under the Payment Services Act 2019 to continue providing payments services. In order to maintain this license and certain other licenses or registrations we hold in certain markets, we are required to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, which will result in increased operational complexity and costs for our Singapore and international operations. In many of the markets outside the U.S. (other than Singapore) served by PayPal Pte. Ltd. or by local branches or subsidiaries subject to local regulatory supervision or oversight, as the case may be, there may be uncertainty whether our Singapore-based service is subject only to Singapore law or also to other local laws, and whether such local laws might require a payment processor like us to be licensed as a payments service, bank, financial institution, or otherwise. There are substantial costs and potential product and operational changes involved in maintaining and renewing licenses, certifications, and approvals, and we could be subject to enforcement actions, fines, and litigation if we are found to violate any of these requirements. There can be no assurance that we will be able to (or decide to) continue to apply for or obtain any licenses, renewals, certifications, and approvals in any jurisdiction. In certain markets, we may need to rely on local banks or other partners to process payments and conduct foreign currency exchange transactions in local currency, and local regulators may use their authority over such local partners to prohibit, restrict, or limit us from doing business. Any of the foregoing could, individually or in the aggregate, result in substantial additional costs, delay or preclude planned transactions, product launches or improvements, require significant and costly operational changes, impose restrictions, limitations, or additional requirements on our business, products and services, or prevent or limit us from providing our products or services in a given market. Cryptocurrency Regulation and Related Risks Our customer cryptocurrency offerings could subject us to additional regulations, licensing requirements, or other obligations or liabilities. Within the U.S., we are regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services as a virtual currency business, which does not qualify us to engage in securities brokerage or dealing activities. The regulatory status of particular cryptocurrencies is unclear under existing law. For example, if the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) were to assert that any of the cryptocurrencies we support are securities, the SEC could assert that our activities involving that cryptocurrency require securities broker-dealer registration or other obligations under the federal securities laws. The rapidly evolving regulatory landscape with respect to cryptocurrency may subject us to additional licensing and regulatory obligations or to additional inquiries or investigations from the SEC or other regulators and governmental authorities, and require us to make product changes, restrict or discontinue product offerings in certain markets, implement additional and potentially costly controls, or take other actions. In August 2023, a third-party issuer with which we have partnered commercially (the “PYUSD Issuer”) launched a U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoin named PayPal USD (“PYUSD”), which was initially available to PayPal U.S. customers and subsequently made available to Venmo customers in September 2023. These PayPal and Venmo customers may, if provisioned for external transfers and subject to our sanctions and anti-money laundering controls, send PYUSD to external wallets not controlled by PayPal. The PYUSD Issuer may also allow institutional users to directly purchase PYUSD from the PYUSD Issuer (as per the PYUSD Issuer’s stablecoin terms and conditions). The regulatory treatment of stablecoins is evolving and has drawn significant attention from legislative and regulatory bodies around the world, including the SEC. There are uncertainties on how ongoing changes to federal, state, and international laws and regulations would apply to stablecoins in practice, and we and the PYUSD Issuer may face substantial costs to operationalize and comply with any additional or changed requirement. If we or the PYUSD Issuer fail to comply with regulations, requirements, prohibitions or other obligations applicable to us, we could face regulatory or other enforcement actions, potential fines, and other consequences. In addition, we could face 19 reputational harm through our relationship with the PYUSD Issuer if the PYUSD Issuer were to face regulatory scrutiny, PYUSD is deemed to be a security, or PYUSD is alleged to be used for transactions in connection with illicit or illegal activities.We hold our customers’ cryptocurrency assets through one or more third-party custodians. Financial and third-party risks related to our customer cryptocurrency offerings, such as inappropriate access to, theft, or destruction of cryptocurrency assets held by our custodians, insufficient insurance coverage by a custodian to reimburse us for all such losses, a custodian’s failure to maintain effective controls over the custody and settlement services provided to us, a custodian’s inability to purchase or liquidate cryptocurrency holdings, the failure of the PYUSD Issuer to maintain sufficient reserve assets backing PYUSD and defaults on financial or performance obligations by a custodian, banks with which the PYUSD Issuer maintains reserve assets or counterparty financial institutions, could expose our customers and us to loss, and therefore significantly harm our business, financial performance, and reputation. We have selected custodian partners and the PYUSD Issuer, and may in the future select additional custodian partners and stablecoin issuing entities, that are subject to regulatory oversight, capital requirements, maintenance of audit and compliance industry certifications, and cybersecurity procedures and policies. Nevertheless, operational disruptions at any such custodian or issuer, or such custodians’ or issuer’s failure to safeguard cryptocurrency holdings (or reserve assets) could result in losses of customer assets, expose us to customer claims, reduce consumer confidence and materially impact our operating results and our cryptocurrency product offerings.Custodial arrangements to safeguard cryptocurrency assets involve unique risks and uncertainties in the event of a custodian’s bankruptcy. While other types of assets and some custodied cryptocurrencies have been deemed not to be part of the custodian’s bankruptcy estate under various regulatory regimes, bankruptcy courts have not yet definitively determined the appropriate treatment of custodial holdings of digital assets in a bankruptcy proceeding. In the event of a custodian’s bankruptcy, the lack of precedent and the highly fact-dependent nature of the determination could delay or preclude the return of custodied cryptocurrency assets to us or to our customers. Although we contractually require our custodians to segregate our customer assets and not commingle them with proprietary or other assets, we cannot be certain that these contractual obligations, even if duly observed by a custodian, will be effective in preventing such assets from being treated as part of the custodian’s estate under bankruptcy or other insolvency law. In that event, our claim on behalf of such customers against a custodian’s estate for our customers’ cryptocurrency assets could be treated as a general unsecured claim against the custodian, in which case our customers could seek to hold us liable for any resulting losses.In addition, our cryptocurrency product offerings could have the effect of heightening or exacerbating many of the risk factors described in this “Risk Factors” section. Lending Regulation We hold a number of U.S. state lending licenses for our U.S. consumer short-term installment loan product, which is subject to federal and state laws governing consumer credit and debt collection. While the consumer short-term installment loan products that we offer outside the U.S. are generally exempt from primary consumer credit legislation, certain consumer lending laws, consumer protection or banking transparency regulations continue to apply to these products. Increased global regulatory focus on short-term installment products and consumer credit more broadly could result in laws or regulations requiring changes to our policies, procedures, operations, and product offerings, and restrict or limit our ability to offer credit products. Consumer Protection Violations of federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations, including the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (“EFTA”) and Regulation E as implemented by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), could result in the assessment of significant actual damages or statutory damages or penalties (including treble damages in some instances) and plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees. We are subject to, and have paid amounts in settlement of, lawsuits containing allegations that our business violated the EFTA and Regulation E or otherwise advance claims for relief relating to our business practices (e.g., that we improperly held consumer funds or otherwise improperly limited consumer accounts).In addition, the CFPB, pursuant to its market-monitoring authority, may require us to provide extensive information on our products and offerings. From time to time, we have received orders from the CFPB pursuant to such market-monitoring authority requiring us to provide, among other items, extensive information on our payment products, including with respect to the collection, use of, and access to data and consumer protections, as well as our Buy Now, Pay Later offerings. 20 Following the departure of the U.K. from the European Union (“EU”) and the EEA on January 31, 2020 (commonly referred to as “Brexit”), effective November 1, 2023, PayPal’s wholly-owned U.K. subsidiary received authorizations from the FCA as an electronic money institution and consumer credit firm, and registration as a cryptoasset business, subject to certain conditions that will require further implementation action by us. If we are unable to meet these requirements, our U.K. business and operations may be impacted and we may be subject to enforcement actions. Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing; Economic and Trade Sanctions Regulators globally continue to increase standards and expectations regarding anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing, and to expand the scope of existing laws and regulations to emerging products and markets, which may require us to further revise or expand our compliance program globally and/or in specific jurisdictions, including the procedures we use to verify the identity of our customers and to monitor international and domestic transactions. Such changes could have the effect of making compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage, lead to increased friction for customers, and result in a decrease in business. Regulators regularly re-examine the transaction volume thresholds at which we must obtain and keep applicable records or the circumstances in which we must verify identities of customers, and any change to such obligations could result in greater compliance costs and impact our business. We are also required to comply with economic and trade sanctions administered by the U.S., the EU and its member states, the U.K., and other jurisdictions in which we operate. Non-compliance with anti-money laundering laws and regulations or economic and trade sanctions may subject us to significant fines, penalties, lawsuits, and enforcement actions, result in regulatory sanctions and additional compliance requirements, increase regulatory scrutiny of our business, restrict our operations, and damage our reputation and brands. Our compliance history may be considered by OFAC and other regulators as part of any potential future investigation of our sanctions regulation. Privacy and Protection of Customer Data The legal and regulatory environment relating to privacy and data protection laws continues to develop and evolve in ways we cannot predict, including with respect to technologies such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, machine learning, cryptocurrency, and blockchain technology. Any failure or alleged failure by us to comply with our privacy policies as communicated to customers or with privacy and data protection laws relating to our collection, use, storage, transfer, or sharing of customer data with third parties could result in proceedings or actions against us by data protection authorities, other government agencies, or others, which could subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments, and negative publicity, require us to change our business practices, increase the costs and complexity of compliance, result in reputational harm, and materially harm our business. Compliance with inconsistent privacy and data protection laws may also restrict or limit our ability to provide products and services to our customers.PayPal relies on a variety of compliance methods to transfer personal data of EEA individuals to the U.S., including Binding Corporate Rules for internal transfers of certain types of personal data and Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”) as approved by the European Commission for transfers to and from third parties. Additionally, in July 2023, the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the U.K. Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework became effective as additional mechanisms to enable transfers of personal data to the U.S. from the EU/EEA, the U.K., and Switzerland, respectively. The new Data Protection Framework (DPF) replaces prior transatlantic personal data transfer regimes that were invalidated by the Court of Justice of the European Union. As such, there are risks in solely relying on the DPF for internal transfers of personal data to the U.S. While PayPal intends to continue to rely on Binding Corporate Rule and SCCs and will evaluate the circumstances under which the DPF may be leveraged for transfers of personal data to the U.S., we may be subject to regulatory enforcement actions if our approach is deemed to be noncompliant.Many jurisdictions in which we operate globally have enacted, or are in the process of enacting, data privacy legislation or regulations aimed at creating and enhancing individual privacy rights. For example, numerous U.S. states have enacted or are in the process of enacting state level data privacy laws and regulations governing the collection, use, and retention of their residents’ personal information. The continued proliferation of privacy laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate is likely to result in a disparate array of privacy rules with unaligned or conflicting provisions, accountability requirements, individual rights, and national or local enforcement powers, which may subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny and business costs and could lead to unintended consumer confusion. We are subject to regulatory scrutiny and may be subject to legal proceedings under antitrust and competition laws. We are subject to scrutiny by various government agencies regarding antitrust and competition laws and regulations in the U.S. and internationally, including in connection with proposed or implemented business combinations, acquisitions, investments, 21 partnerships, commercial agreements and business practices. Some jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to assert claims of anticompetitive conduct. Companies and government agencies have in the past alleged, and may in the future allege, that our actions violate the antitrust or competition laws in the U.S. or other jurisdictions in which we operate or otherwise constitute unfair competition, or that our products and services are used so broadly that otherwise uncontroversial business practices could be deemed anticompetitive. Any claims or investigations, even if without merit, may be costly to defend or respond to, involve negative publicity, and cause substantial diversion of management’s time and effort, and could result in reputational harm, significant judgments, fines and other remedial actions against us, require us to change our business practices, make product or operational changes, or delay or preclude planned transactions, product launches or improvements. We are regularly subject to general litigation, regulatory scrutiny, and government inquiries. We are regularly subject to claims, individual and class action lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government and regulatory investigations, inquiries, actions or requests, and other proceedings alleging violations of laws, rules, and regulations with respect to competition, antitrust, intellectual property, privacy, data protection, information security, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, sanctions, anti-bribery, anti-corruption, consumer protection (including unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices), the terms of our customer agreements, fraud, accessibility, securities, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, services, charitable fundraising, contract disputes, escheatment of unclaimed or abandoned property, product liability, use of our services for illegal purposes, the matters described in “Note 13—Commitments and Contingencies—Litigation and Regulatory Matters—General Matters” to our consolidated financial statements, and other matters. The number and significance of these disputes and inquiries is expected to continue to increase as our products, services, and business expand in complexity, scale, scope, and geographic reach, including through acquisitions of businesses and technology. Investigations and legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, expensive and disruptive to our operations, and could result in substantial judgments, fines, penalties or settlements, negative publicity, substantial diversion of management’s time and effort, reputational harm, criminal sanctions, or orders that prevent or limit us from offering certain products or services; require us to change our business practices or customer agreement terms in ways that may increase costs or reduce revenues, develop non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies, or pay substantial royalty or licensing fees; or delay or preclude planned transactions or product launches or improvements. Determining legal reserves or possible losses from such matters involves significant estimates and judgments and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes. We may be exposed to losses in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material. If our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Third parties may allege that we are infringing their patents and other intellectual property rights. We are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. Intellectual property infringement claims against us may result from, among other things, our expansion into new business areas, including through acquisitions of businesses and technology, or new or expanded products and services and their convergence with technologies not previously associated with areas related to our business, products, and services. The ultimate outcome of any allegation or claim is often uncertain and any such claim, with or without merit, may be time-consuming to defend, result in costly litigation, divert management’s time and attention from our business, result in reputational harm, and require us to, among other things, redesign or stop providing our products or services, pay substantial amounts to settle claims or lawsuits, satisfy judgments, or pay substantial royalty or licensing fees. We may be unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property. The protection of our proprietary rights, including our trademarks, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, patents and trade secrets, is important to the success of our business. Effective protection of our proprietary rights may not be available in every jurisdiction in which we offer our products and services. Although we have generally taken measures to protect our intellectual property, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in protecting or enforcing our rights in every jurisdiction, that our contractual arrangements will prevent or deter third parties from infringing or misappropriating our intellectual property, or that third parties will not independently develop equivalent or superior intellectual property rights. We may be required to expend significant time and resources to prevent infringement and enforce our rights, and we may be unable to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. If we are unable to prevent third parties from infringing or otherwise violating our proprietary rights, the uniqueness and value of our products and services could be adversely affected, the value of our brands could be diminished, and our business could be adversely affected. We expect to continue to license in the future certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to others. These licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation. Any failure to adequately protect or enforce our 22 proprietary rights, or significant costs incurred in doing so, could diminish the value of our intangible assets and materially harm our business. BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS RISKS We face substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry. The global payments industry is highly competitive, dynamic, highly innovative, and increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny and oversight. Many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with innovative and disruptive technologies, shifting user preferences and needs, price sensitivity of merchants and consumers, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Competition also may intensify as new competitors emerge, businesses enter into business combinations and partnerships, and established companies in other segments expand to become competitive with various aspects of our business.We compete with a wide range of businesses in every aspect of our business. Some of our current and potential competitors are or may be larger than we are, have larger customer bases, greater brand recognition, longer operating histories, a dominant or more secure position, broader geographic scope, volume, scale, resources, and market share than we do, or offer products and services that we do not offer. Other competitors are or may be smaller or younger companies that may be more agile in responding to regulatory and technological changes and customer preferences. Our competitors may devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of products and services, and/or offer lower prices or more effectively offer their own innovative programs, products, and services. We often partner with other businesses, and the ability to continue establishing these partnerships is important to our business. Competition for relationships with these partners is intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to establish, grow, or maintain these partner relationships. If we are unable to differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors, drive value for our customers, or effectively and efficiently align our resources with our goals and objectives, we may not be able to compete effectively. See “Item 1. Business—Competition” of this Form 10-K for further discussion of the competitive environment in the markets where we operate. Changes to payment card networks or bank fees, rules, or practices could harm our business. To process certain transactions, we must comply with applicable payment card, bank or other network (collectively, “network”) rules. The rules govern all aspects of a transaction on the networks, including fees and other practices. From time to time, the networks have increased the fees and assessments that they charge for transactions that access their networks. Certain networks have also imposed special fees or assessments for transactions that are executed through a digital wallet such as the one that PayPal offers. Our payment processors may have the right to pass any increases in fees and assessments on to us and to increase their own fees for processing. Any increase in interchange fees, special fees, or assessments for transactions that we pay to the networks or our payment processors could make our pricing less competitive, increase our operating costs, and reduce our operating income, which could materially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.In some jurisdictions, government regulations have required payment card networks to reduce or cap interchange fees. Any changes in interchange fee rates or limitations, or their applicability to PayPal, could adversely affect our competitive position against payment card service providers and the revenue we earn from our branded card programs, require us to change our business practices, and harm our business.We may also be subject to fines and other penalties assessed by networks resulting from any rule violations by us or our merchants. The networks set and interpret their rules, and have alleged from time to time that various aspects of our business model violate these rules, or our agreements with the networks. Such allegations may result in significant fines, penalties, damages, or other liabilities, adversely impact benefits to us under the agreements, or require changes in our business practices that may be costly and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The network rules may also increase the cost of, impose restrictions on, or otherwise impact the development of, our products which may negatively affect product deployment and adoption. The networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or re-interpret existing rules that we or our payment processors might find difficult or impractical to follow, or costly to implement, which could require us to make significant changes to our products, increase our operational costs, and negatively impact our business. If we become unable or limited in our ability to accept certain payment types such as debit or credit cards, our business would be materially and adversely affected. Changes in how consumers fund their PayPal transactions could harm our business. We pay transaction fees when consumers fund payment transactions using credit cards, lower fees when consumers fund payments with debit cards, and nominal fees when consumers fund payment transactions by electronic transfer of funds from bank accounts, from an existing PayPal account balance or Venmo account balance, or through our PayPal branded consumer 23 credit products. Our financial performance is sensitive to changes in the rate at which our consumers fund payments using payment cards, which can significantly increase our costs. Although we provide consumers in certain markets with the opportunity to use their existing PayPal account balance or Venmo account balance to fund payment transactions, some of our consumers may prefer to use payment cards, which may offer features and benefits not provided as part of their PayPal accounts. Any increase in the portion of our payment volume funded using payment cards or in fees associated with our funding mix, or other events or developments that make it more difficult or costly for us to fund transactions with lower-cost funding options, could materially and adversely affect our financial performance and significantly harm our business. Our credit products expose us to additional risks. We offer credit products to a wide range of consumers and merchants in the U.S. and various international markets. The financial success of these products depends largely on the effective management of related risk. The credit decision-making process for our consumer credit products uses proprietary methodologies and credit algorithms and other analytical techniques designed to analyze the credit risk of specific consumers based on, among other factors, their past purchase and transaction history with PayPal or Venmo and their credit scores. Similarly, proprietary risk models and other indicators are applied to assess merchants who desire to use our merchant financing offerings to help predict their ability to repay. These risk models may not accurately predict the creditworthiness of a consumer or merchant due to inaccurate assumptions, including those related to the particular consumer or merchant, market conditions, economic environment, or limited transaction history or other data. The accuracy of these risk models and the ability to manage credit risk related to our credit products may also be affected by legal or regulatory requirements, changes in consumer behavior, changes in the economic environment, issuing bank policies, and other factors. We generally rely on the activities and charters of unaffiliated financial institutions to provide PayPal and Venmo branded consumer credit and merchant financing offerings to our U.S. customers. As a service provider to these unaffiliated financial institutions, which are federally supervised U.S. financial institutions, we are subject from time to time to examination by their federal banking regulators. In the event of any termination or interruption in a partner bank’s ability or willingness to lend, our ability to offer consumer credit and merchant financing products could be interrupted or limited, which could materially and adversely affect our business. We may be unable to reach a similar arrangement with another unaffiliated financial institution on favorable terms or at all. Obtaining and maintaining the lending licenses required for us to originate such loans ourselves would be a costly, time-consuming and uncertain process, and would subject us to additional laws and regulatory requirements, which could significantly increase our costs and compliance obligations and require us to change our business practices.Merchant loans under our U.S. PayPal Working Capital (“PPWC”) and PayPal Business Loan (“PPBL”) products and certain U.S. installment loan products are provided by a state-chartered industrial bank under a program agreement with us, and we acquire the receivables generated by those loans from the state-chartered bank after origination. In June 2020, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) approved a final rule clarifying that loans validly originated by state-chartered banks or insured branches of foreign banks remain valid throughout the lifetime of the loan, reflecting a similar rule finalized by the Office of the Comptroller of Currency (“OCC”) in May 2020 for nationally chartered banks. The final rule reaffirms and codifies the so-called “valid-when-made doctrine,” which provides that the permissibility of an interest rate for a loan is determined when the loan is made and will not be affected by subsequent events such as sale, assignment, or other transfer. While a number of state attorneys general have unsuccessfully challenged these FDIC and OCC rules, there remains some uncertainty whether non-bank entities purchasing loan receivables originated by FDIC-insured, state-chartered banks may rely on federal preemption of state usury laws and other state laws. An adverse outcome of these or similar challenges, or changes to applicable laws and regulations or regulatory policy, could materially impact our U.S. PPWC, PPBL, certain installment products, and our business.We are subject to the risk that account holders who use our credit products will default on their payment obligations. The non-payment rate among account holders may increase due to, among other factors, changes to underwriting standards, risk models not accurately predicting the creditworthiness of a user, worsening economic conditions, such as a recession or government austerity programs, increases in prevailing interest rates, and high unemployment rates. Account holders who miss payments often fail to repay their loans, and account holders who file for protection under the bankruptcy laws generally do not repay their loans. Any deterioration in the performance of loans facilitated through our platform or unexpected losses on such loans may increase the risk of potential charge-offs, increase our allowance for loans and interest receivable, negatively impact our revenue share arrangement with an independent chartered financial institution with respect to our U.S. consumer credit products, and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.We currently purchase receivables related to our U.S. PayPal-branded merchant financing offerings and certain U.S. consumer installment loan products and extend credit for our consumer and merchant products outside the U.S. through our international 24 subsidiaries. In June 2023, we entered into a multi-year agreement to sell up to €40 billion of U.K. and European buy now, pay later (“BNPL”) loan receivables originated by PayPal (Europe) and PayPal U.K., consisting of the sale of a substantial majority of the U.K. and European BNPL loan portfolio held on PayPal (Europe)’s balance sheet at the closing of the transaction and a forward-flow arrangement for the sale of future originations of eligible loans, and in October 2023, we began selling those receivables. The sale of future eligible receivables is subject to certain conditions. If these conditions are not satisfied or waived or if the parties are unable to fulfill their obligations under these arrangements, the sale of these receivables could be delayed and we may not realize the expected benefits of this arrangement. From time to time, we may consider other third-party sources of funding (including asset sales, warehouse facilities, forward-flow arrangements, securitizations, partnerships or other funding structures) for our credit portfolio or other receivables. The availability of such third-party funding is subject to a number of factors, including economic conditions and interest rates, and there can be no assurance that any such funding arrangements can be obtained on favorable terms or at all. If we are unable to fund our credit products or the purchase of the receivables related to our credit products and offerings adequately or in a cost-effective manner, the growth of our credit products and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted. We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk. We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, including networks, banks, payment processors, and payment gateways that link us to the payment card and bank clearing networks to process transactions; unaffiliated third-party lenders to originate our U.S. credit products to consumers, U.S. merchant financing, and branded credit card products; branded debit card and savings products issued by unaffiliated banks; cryptocurrency custodial service providers; and external business partners and contractors who provide key functions (e.g., outsourced customer support and product development functions; facilities; information technology, data center facilities and cloud computing). We are subject to additional risks inherent in engaging and relying upon third-party providers, including legal, regulatory, information security, reputational and operational risks. We are undertaking efforts to diversify our reliance on a small number of third-party payment processors in various markets. We are working with our primary payment processor in the U.S. to facilitate the migration of our arrangements to other payment processors over a transition period in connection with the wind-down of our agreement; however, if we are unable to timely and efficiently migrate our business to other payment processors or experience disruptions in connection with this transition, our business could be harmed. If we are unable to effectively manage our third-party relationships, these third parties are unable to meet their obligations to us, or we experience substantial disruptions in these relationships, our operations, results of operations, and financial results could be adversely impacted. Additionally, our relationships with third parties inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, governance, and compliance, which potentially increases our financial, legal, reputational, and operational risk. Any factors that reduce cross-border trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business. Cross-border trade (i.e., transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries) is an important source of our revenues and profits. Cross-border transactions generally provide higher revenues and operating income than similar transactions that take place within a single country or market. In certain markets, cross-border trade represents our primary (and in some instances our only) presence. Cross-border trade may be negatively impacted by various factors including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, tariffs, trade barriers or restrictions, sanctions, import or export controls, and the interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions in the context of cross-border trade and foreign exchange. Any factors that increase the costs of cross-border trade for us or our customers or that restrict, delay, or make cross-border trade more difficult or impractical could reduce our cross-border transactions and volume, negatively impact our revenues and profits, and harm our business. Failure to deal effectively with fraud, abusive behaviors, bad transactions, and negative customer experiences may increase our loss rate and could negatively impact our business and severely diminish merchant and consumer confidence in and use of our services. We expect that third parties will continue to attempt to abuse access to and misuse our payments services to commit fraud by, among other things, creating fictitious PayPal accounts using stolen or synthetic identities or personal information, making transactions with stolen financial instruments, abusing or misusing our services for financial gain, or fraudulently inducing users of our systems into engaging in fraudulent transactions. Due to the nature of PayPal’s digital payments services, third parties may seek to engage in abusive schemes or fraud attacks that are often difficult to detect and may be deployed at a scale that would otherwise not be possible in physical transactions. Measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud and abusive 25 behavior are complex, require continuous improvement, and may not be effective in detecting and preventing fraud, particularly new and continually evolving forms of fraud or in connection with new or expanded product offerings. If these measures are not effective, our business could be negatively impacted. We also incur substantial losses from erroneous transactions and situations where funding instruments used for legitimate transactions are closed or have insufficient funds to satisfy payments, or the payment is initiated to an unintended recipient in error. Numerous and evolving fraud schemes and misuse of our payments services could subject us to significant costs and liabilities, require us to change our business practices, cause us to incur significant remediation costs, lead to loss of customer confidence in, or decreased use of, our products and services, damage our reputation and brands, divert the attention of management from the operation of our business, and result in significant compensation or contractual penalties from us to our customers and their business partners as a result of losses or claims. While we actively seek to recover transaction losses where possible, such recoveries may be insufficient to compensate us for such losses. Our Purchase and Seller Protection Programs (“protection programs”) are intended to reduce the likelihood of losses for consumers and merchants from unauthorized and fraudulent transactions. Our Purchase Protection Program also protects consumers who do not receive the item ordered or who receive an item that is significantly different from its description. We incur substantial losses from our protection programs as a result of disputes filed by our customers. We seek to recover losses from our protection programs from the merchant, but may not be able to fully recover our losses (for example, if the merchant is unwilling or unable to pay, the transaction involves a fraudulent merchant, or the merchant provides sufficient evidence that the item was delivered). In addition, consumers who pay through PayPal or Venmo may have reimbursement rights from their payment card issuer, which in turn will seek recovery from us. If losses incurred by us related to payment card transactions become excessive, we could lose the ability to accept payment cards for payment, which would negatively impact our business. Regulators and card networks may also adapt error resolution and chargeback requirements to account for evolving forms of fraud, which could increase PayPal’s exposure to fraud losses and impact the scope of coverage of our protection programs. Increases in our loss rate, including as a result of changes to the scope of transactions covered by our protection programs, could negatively impact our business. See “Note 13—Commitments and Contingencies—Protection Programs” to our consolidated financial statements.Failure to effectively monitor and evaluate the financial condition of our merchants may expose PayPal to losses. In the event of the bankruptcy, insolvency, business failure, or other business interruption of a merchant that sells goods or services in advance of the date of their delivery or use (e.g., airline, cruise, or concert tickets, custom-made goods, and subscriptions), we could be liable to the buyers of such goods or services, including through our Purchase Protection Program or through chargebacks on payment cards used by customers to fund their purchase. Allowances for transaction losses that we have established may be insufficient to cover incurred losses. Use of our payments services for illegal activities or improper purposes could harm our business. We expect that users will continue to attempt to use our payments platform for illegal activities or improper uses, including money laundering, terrorist financing, sanctions evasion, illegal online gambling, fraudulent sales of goods or services, illegal telemarketing activities, illegal sales of prescription medications or controlled substances, piracy of software, movies, music, and other copyrighted, trademarked or digital goods, bank fraud, child pornography, human trafficking, prohibited sales of alcoholic beverages or tobacco products, securities fraud, pyramid or Ponzi schemes, or the facilitation of other illegal or improper activity. Moreover, certain activity that may be legal in one jurisdiction may be illegal in another jurisdiction, and a merchant may be found responsible for intentionally or inadvertently importing or exporting illegal goods, resulting in liability for us. Owners of intellectual property rights or government authorities may seek to bring legal action against providers of payments solutions, including PayPal, that are peripherally involved in the sale of infringing or allegedly infringing items by a user. While we invest in measures intended to prevent and detect illegal activities that may occur on our payments platform, these measures require continuous improvement and may not be effective in detecting and preventing illegal activity or improper uses.Any illegal or improper uses of our payments platform or failure by us to detect or prevent illegal or improper activity by our users may subject us to claims, individual and class action lawsuits, and government and regulatory requests, inquiries, or investigations that could result in liability, restrict our operations, impose additional restrictions or limitations on our business or require us to change our business practices, harm our reputation, increase our costs, and negatively impact our business. 26 Acquisitions, dispositions, strategic investments, and other strategic transactions could result in operating difficulties and could harm our business. We expect to continue to consider and evaluate a wide array of potential strategic transactions as part of our overall business strategy, including business combinations, acquisitions, and dispositions of certain businesses, technologies, services, products, and other assets; strategic investments; and commercial and strategic partnerships (collectively, “strategic transactions”). At any given time, we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more strategic transactions, any of which could, individually or in the aggregate, be material to our financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying, negotiating, consummating and integrating transaction opportunities. Strategic transactions may involve additional significant challenges, uncertainties, and risks, including challenges of obtaining regulatory or other approvals, integrating new employees, products, systems, technologies, operations, and business cultures; challenges associated with operating acquired businesses in markets or business areas in which we may have limited or no experience; disruption of our ongoing operations and diversion of our management’s attention; inadequate data security, cybersecurity, or operational and information technology resilience; failure to identify, or our underestimation of, commitments, liabilities, deficiencies and other risks associated with acquired businesses or assets; potential exposure to new or incremental risks associated with acquired businesses and entities, strategic investments or other strategic transactions, including potential new or increased regulatory oversight and uncertain or evolving legal, regulatory, and compliance requirements, particularly with respect to companies in new or developing businesses or industries; challenges associated with dispositions of business or operations, including disruption to other parts of our business, potential loss of employees or customers, the transfer of technology and/or certain intellectual property rights to third-party purchasers, or exposure to unanticipated liabilities or ongoing obligations to us following any such dispositions; failure of the transaction to advance our business strategy or for its anticipated benefits to materialize; potential impairment of goodwill or other acquisition-related intangible assets; and the potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities or the incurrence of significant additional debt. Strategic transactions are inherently risky, may not be successful, and may harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Strategic investments in which we have a minority ownership stake inherently involve a lesser degree of influence over business operations. The success of our strategic investments may be dependent on controlling shareholders, management, or other persons or entities that may have business interests, strategies, or goals that are inconsistent with ours. Business decisions or other actions or omissions of the controlling shareholders, management, or other persons or entities who control companies in which we invest may adversely affect the value of our investment, result in litigation or regulatory action against us, and damage our reputation. Our international operations subject us to increased risks, which could harm our business. Our international operations generate a significant portion of our net revenues. Our international operations subject us to significant challenges, uncertainties, and risks, including local regulatory, licensing, reporting, and legal obligations; costs and challenges associated with operating in markets in which we may have limited or no experience, including effectively localizing our products and services and adapting them to local preferences; difficulties in developing, staffing, and simultaneously managing a large number of varying foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences and in light of varying laws, regulations, and customs; differing employment practices and the existence of works councils; difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified employees and maintaining our company culture; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; exchange control regulations; profit repatriation restrictions; potential tariffs, sanctions, fines, or other trade barriers or restrictions; import or export regulations; compliance with U.S. and foreign anti-bribery, anti-corruption, sanctions, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws and regulations; the interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions; and national or regional political, economic, or social instability.Our international operations also may heighten many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section. Any violations of the complex foreign and U.S. laws, rules and regulations that may apply to our international operations may result in lawsuits, enforcement actions, criminal actions, or sanctions against us and, our directors, officers, and employees; prohibit or require us to change our business practices; and damage our reputation. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies. These risks are inherent in our international operations, may increase our costs of doing business internationally, and could materially and adversely affect our business. Global and regional economic conditions could harm our business. 27 Adverse global and regional economic conditions such as turmoil affecting the banking system or financial markets, including, but not limited to, tightening in the credit markets, extreme volatility or distress in the financial markets (including the fixed income, credit, currency, equity, and commodity markets), higher unemployment, high consumer debt levels, recessionary or inflationary pressures, supply chain issues, reduced consumer confidence or economic activity, government fiscal, monetary and tax policies, U.S. and international trade relationships, agreements, treaties, tariffs and restrictive actions, the inability of a government to enact a budget in a fiscal year, government shutdowns, government austerity programs, and other negative financial news or macroeconomic developments could have a material adverse impact on the demand for our products and services, including a reduction in the volume and size of transactions on our payments platform. Additionally, any inability to access the capital markets when needed due to volatility or illiquidity in the markets or increased regulatory liquidity and capital requirements may strain our liquidity position. Such conditions may also expose us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates that could materially and adversely affect our financial results. If our reputation or our brands are damaged, our business and operating results may be harmed. Our reputation and brands are globally recognized, important to our business, and affect our ability to attract and retain our customers. There are numerous ways our reputation or brands could be damaged. We may experience scrutiny or criticism from customers, partners, employees, government entities, media, advocacy groups, and other influencers or stakeholders that disagree with, among other things, our product offering decisions or public policy positions. Damage to our reputation or our brands may result from, among other things, new features, products, services, operational efforts, or terms of service (or changes to the same), or our decisions regarding user privacy, data practices, or information security. The proliferation of social media may increase and compound the likelihood, speed, magnitude, and unpredictability of negative brand events. If our brands or reputation are damaged, our business and operating results may be adversely impacted. Real or perceived inaccuracies in our key metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business. Our key metrics are calculated using internal company data based on the activity we measure on our payments platform and compiled from multiple systems, including systems that are internally developed or acquired through business combinations. While the measurement of our key metrics is based on what we believe to be reasonable methodologies and estimates, there are inherent challenges and limitations in measuring our key metrics globally at scale. The methodologies used to calculate our key metrics require significant judgment. We regularly review our processes for calculating these key metrics, and from time to time we may make adjustments to improve the accuracy or relevance of our metrics. For example, we continuously apply models, processes and practices designed to detect and prevent fraudulent account creation on our platforms, and work to improve and enhance those capabilities. When we detect a significant volume of illegitimate activity, we generally remove the activity identified from our key metrics. Although such adjustments may impact key metrics reported in prior periods, we generally do not update previously reported key metrics to reflect these subsequent adjustments unless the retrospective impact of process improvements or enhancements is determined by management to be material. Further, as our business develops, we may revise or cease reporting metrics if we determine that such metrics are no longer appropriate measures of our performance. If investors, analysts, or customers do not consider our reported measures to be sufficient or to accurately reflect our business, we may receive negative publicity, our reputation may be harmed, and our business may be adversely impacted. Environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) issues may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and damage our reputation. Investors, customers, employees, regulators, legislators and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on ESG matters and related disclosures, including with respect to cybersecurity, data privacy and protection, global talent and climate. If we are unable to comply with new laws and regulations or changes to legal or regulatory requirements concerning ESG matters, or fail to meet investor, industry or stakeholder expectations and standards, our reputation may be harmed, customers may choose to refrain from using our products and services, we may be subject to fines, penalties, regulatory or other enforcement actions, and our business or financial condition may be adversely affected. We may also experience additional scrutiny or criticism from investors, customers, partners, media, government entities, and other stakeholders if they perceive PayPal to not have acted appropriately with respect to ESG matters. If our ESG-related data, processes and reporting are incomplete or inaccurate, or if we fail to achieve progress with respect to ESG-related goals on a timely basis, or at all, our reputation, business, financial performance and growth could be adversely affected.We specifically recognize the inherent physical climate-related risks where we conduct business. Our primary locations may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. For example, California, where our headquarters are located, has 28 historically experienced, and is projected to continue to experience, extreme weather and natural disaster events more frequently, including drought, water scarcity, flooding, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality impacts, and power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention. Such events may disrupt our business and may cause us to experience additional costs to maintain or resume operations and higher attrition. If one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their financial or performance obligations to us or fail, we may incur significant losses. We have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents, receivables outstanding, and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the U.S. and international jurisdictions. As part of our foreign currency hedging activities, we regularly enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments with various financial institutions. Certain banks and other financial institutions are also lenders under our credit facilities. We regularly monitor our concentration of, and exposure to counterparty risk, and actively manage this exposure to mitigate the associated risk. Despite these efforts, we may be exposed to the risk of default on obligations by, or deteriorating operating results or financial condition or failure of, these counterparty financial institutions. If one of our counterparty financial institutions were to become insolvent, placed into receivership, or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or to access or recover our assets that are deposited, held in accounts with, or otherwise due from, such counterparty may be limited due to the insufficiency of the failed institutions’ estate to satisfy all claims in full or the applicable laws or regulations governing the insolvency, bankruptcy, or resolution proceedings. In the event of default on obligations by, or the failure of, one or more of these counterparties, we could incur significant losses, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. If we are unable, or perceived as unable, to effectively manage customer funds, our business could be harmed. We hold a substantial amount of funds belonging to our customers, including balances in customer accounts and funds being remitted to sellers of goods and services or recipients of person-to-person transactions. In certain jurisdictions where we operate, we are required to comply with applicable regulatory requirements with respect to customer balances. Our success is reliant on public confidence in our ability to effectively manage our customers’ balances and handle substantial transaction volumes and amounts of customer funds. Any failure to manage customer funds in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, or any public loss of confidence in us or our ability to effectively manage customer balances, could lead customers to discontinue or reduce their use of our products or reduce customer balances held with us, which could significantly harm our business. There are risks associated with our indebtedness. We have incurred indebtedness, and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations and generate sufficient cash flows to service such debt. Our outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness we incur may have significant consequences, including the need to use a significant portion of our cash flow from operations and other available cash to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes, including capital expenditures, acquisitions, strategic investments, and share repurchases; the reduction of our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business, competitive pressures and market conditions; and limits on our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, strategic investments, share repurchases, or other general corporate purposes.Our revolving credit facilities and the indentures for our senior unsecured notes pursuant to which certain of our outstanding debt securities were issued contain financial and other covenants that restrict or could restrict, among other things, our business and operations. If we fail to pay amounts due under a debt instrument or breach any of its covenants, the lenders or noteholders would typically have the right to demand immediate repayment of all borrowings thereunder (subject in certain cases to a grace or cure period). Moreover, any such acceleration and required repayment of, or default in respect of, our indebtedness could, in turn, constitute an event of default under other debt instruments, thereby resulting in the acceleration and required repayment of our indebtedness. Any of these events could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.Changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity securities and increase our borrowing costs. If our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, the interest rates payable by us under our indebtedness may increase, and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected. 29 Changes in tax laws, exposure to unanticipated additional tax liabilities, or implementation of reporting or record-keeping obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business. An increasing number of U.S. states, the U.S. federal government, and governments of foreign jurisdictions, such as the EU Commission, as well as international organizations, such as the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”), are focused on tax reform and other legislative or regulatory action to increase tax revenue. For example, various countries have proposed or enacted digital services taxes and global minimum tax provisions under the Pillar Two OECD model rules. These actions may materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate, net income, and cash flows. The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation and significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are currently undergoing a number of investigations, audits, and reviews by tax authorities in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could result in unforeseen tax-related liabilities that differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements, which may, individually or in the aggregate, materially affect our financial results in the periods for which such determination is made. While we have established reserves based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventualities, these reserves may prove to be insufficient.In addition, our future income taxes could be adversely affected by the incurrence of losses or earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates, and earnings being higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, including as a result of gains on our foreign currency exchange risk management program; by changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles; or by certain discrete items.A number of U.S. states, the U.S. federal government, and foreign jurisdictions have implemented and may impose reporting or record-keeping obligations on companies that engage in or facilitate e-commerce to improve tax compliance. A number of jurisdictions are also reviewing whether payment service providers and other intermediaries could be deemed to be the legal agent of merchants for certain tax purposes. We have modified our systems to meet applicable requirements and expect that further modifications will be required to comply with future requirements, which may negatively impact our customer experience and increase operational costs. Any failure by us to comply with these and similar reporting and record-keeping obligations could result in substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions, adversely impact our ability to do business in certain jurisdictions, and harm our business. We may be unable to attract, retain, and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our business. Competition for key and other highly skilled personnel is intense, especially for executive talent, software engineers, and other technology talent. We may be limited in our ability to recruit or hire internationally, including due to restrictive laws or policies on immigration, travel, or availability of visas for skilled workers. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel, or our inability to attract, hire, develop, motivate and retain key and other highly qualified and diverse talent, whether in a remote or in-office environment, or protect the safety, health and productivity of our workforce could harm our overall business and results of operations. We are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our products and services. We may be subject to claims relating to information disseminated through our online services, including claims alleging defamation, libel, harassment, hate speech, breach of contract, invasion of privacy, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through the services, among other things. We invest in measures intended to detect and block activities that may occur on our payments platform in violation of our policies and applicable laws. These measures require continuous improvement and may not be sufficiently effective in detecting and preventing the exchange of information in violation of our policies and applicable laws. If these measures are not sufficiently effective, our business could be negatively impacted. If the laws or regulations that provide protections for online dissemination of information are invalidated or are modified to reduce protections available to us and we become liable for information provided by our customers and carried on our products and services, we could be directly harmed and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure, including expending substantial resources or discontinuing certain product or service offerings, which could harm our business. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. 30 ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY CYBERSECURITY RISK MANAGEMENT AND STRATEGY Our Information Security Program is designed to support the Company in identifying, protecting, detecting, responding to, and recovering from cybersecurity threats and incidents (collectively, “cybersecurity risks”) with the intention to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our critical systems and information. We design and regularly assess our Information Security Program guided by National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) and ISO standards (including ISO 27001), proprietary controls and industry best practices.Our Information Security Program is built on a three lines of defense model integrated into our overall Enterprise Risk and Compliance Management Program (“ERCM Program”). It shares common methodologies, reporting channels, and governance processes that apply across the ERCM Program to other legal, compliance, strategic, operational, and financial risk areas. The Program is governed by the Technology, Information Security, and Privacy Risk Management Committee and overseen by our Board of Directors (“Board”) and its Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee (“ARC Committee”).The three lines of defense model is designed to provide a structure for risk accountability in the first line of defense (“FLOD”), effective challenge by the second line of defense (“SLOD”), and independent risk assurance by the third line of defense (“TLOD”). Our Office of the Chief Information Security Officer serves as FLOD and provides operational and technical controls and capabilities to protect against cybersecurity risks. The Technology and Information Security team serves as SLOD and provides independent oversight of our technology and cybersecurity risk mitigation practices and capabilities. As TLOD, Internal Audit independently assesses the effectiveness of our first and second line of defense organizations in managing cybersecurity risk and independently reports the results of audits to our ARC Committee to assist it in its oversight duties. Our Information Security Program includes:•Risk assessments designed to help identify material cybersecurity risks to our critical systems, information, products, services, and our broader enterprise Information Technology (“IT”) environment;•Regular testing of our systems to identify and address potential vulnerabilities;•Integrated planning and preparedness activities supporting business continuity and operational resiliency;•Security teams principally responsible for managing (1) our annual cybersecurity risk assessment processes, (2) our security controls, and (3) our response to cybersecurity incidents;•A cybersecurity incident response plan that includes procedures for responding to cybersecurity incidents; •24/7 monitoring and measurement of cybersecurity threats through our PayPal Cyber Defense Center (“CDC”);•The use of external service providers, where appropriate, to assess, test or otherwise assist with aspects of our security controls;•An information training and awareness program for our employees, contractors, incident response personnel, and senior management; and•A third-party risk management framework designed to monitor and address risks from cybersecurity incidents of service providers, suppliers, and vendors that includes due diligence over third-party’s information security and technology control environment at onboarding and periodically throughout the lifecycle of the relationship. In addition, our standard contractual terms require notification and communication from third parties in the event of a cybersecurity incident. We maintain procedures to respond to, manage and mitigate third-party cybersecurity events and vulnerabilities when identified.For a description of risks from known cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any prior cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our operations, business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” under the captions “Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to our reputation, business, and financial condition” and “Business interruptions or systems failures may impair the availability of our websites, applications, products or services, or otherwise harm our business.” 31 CYBERSECURITY GOVERNANCE Our Board considers cybersecurity risk as part of its risk oversight function and has delegated to our ARC Committee oversight of cybersecurity and other information technology risks. The ARC Committee oversees PayPal’s overall risk framework, including management’s implementation of our cybersecurity risk management program, and reports to the full Board of Directors on a regular basis on cybersecurity and information technology risk management.The ARC Committee receives periodic reports from the Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”) on our cybersecurity risks. Our CISO has numerous years of experience at PayPal and other organizations building security products, managing security infrastructure, providing a variety of security services, and overseeing incident response and management, escalation of security events, vulnerability scanning, and security defect management. Management also updates the ARC Committee, as necessary, regarding cybersecurity incidents. The ARC Committee reports to the Board regarding its activities, including those related to cybersecurity risk oversight. The Board also receives briefings at least annually from management on our Information Security Program. Board members receive presentations on cybersecurity topics from our CISO and external experts from time to time as part of our continuing education to Board on topics relevant to their service as a member of our Board.Our cybersecurity teams, overseen by our CISO, are responsible for assessing and managing our risks from cybersecurity threats, including defining security policy and board reporting of security risk. The CISO approves all security policies and oversees the identification, assessment, and management of cybersecurity risks, which provides a proactive and comprehensive approach to safeguarding our information assets. The teams have primary responsibility for our overall Information Security Program and supervise both our internal cybersecurity personnel and our external cybersecurity consultants. Our cybersecurity teams’ experience includes cybersecurity incident response, in-depth security assessments and security emulation exercises to evaluate security profile, security research, education and outreach, and security tool development. Our cybersecurity teams, in coordination with the CDC, supervise efforts to prevent, detect, mitigate, and remediate cybersecurity threats and incidents through the operation of our incident response plan and various other means, which may include briefings from internal security personnel, threat intelligence and other information obtained from governmental, public or private sources, including external consultants engaged by us, as well as alerts and reports produced by security tools deployed in the IT environment. The CDC team oversees, identifies, and addresses security threats aimed at safeguarding PayPal employees, consumers, and merchants.Our CISO organization is responsible for independently identifying, measuring, monitoring, controlling and reporting aggregate risks and for setting policies for the management and oversight of risk. The organization monitors cyber regulation requirements, reviews impacts of new products and initiatives, conduct reviews of cyber assessments and testing activities and provides effective challenge to the FLOD risk management activities. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, in addition to other information appearing in this Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, for important information regarding risks and uncertainties that could affect us. These risk factors do not identify all risks we face, and additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, future prospects, and the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected. We own and lease various properties in the United States (“U.S.”) and other countries around the world. We use these properties for executive and administrative offices, customer services and operations centers, product development offices, and data centers.

    "context": "OVERVIEW PayPal Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in January 2015 and is a leading technology platform that enables digital payments and simplifies commerce experiences on behalf of merchants and consumers worldwide. PayPal is committed to democratizing financial services to help improve the financial health of individuals and to increase economic opportunity for entrepreneurs and businesses of all sizes around the world. Our goal is to enable our merchants and consumers to manage and move their money anywhere in the world in the markets we serve, anytime, on any platform, and using any device when sending payments or getting paid, including person-to-person (“P2P”) payments. Our core values of Inclusion, Innovation, Collaboration, and Wellness, reflected in our leadership principles, are the driving forces behind our mission and form the foundation of our operating philosophy. We believe that our core values help stimulate the creativity and engagement of our global workforce to deliver products and services designed to meet the diverse needs of our customers. We also believe that effective management of environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) risks and opportunities is essential to deliver on our mission and strategy. Unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires, references to “we,” “our,” “us,” “the Company,” or “PayPal” refer to PayPal Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. 4 PayPal’s payment solutions enable our customers to connect, transact, and send and receive payments, whether they are online or in person. We provide proprietary payment solutions accepted by merchants that enable the completion of payments on our platform on behalf of our customers. We operate a global, two-sided network at scale that connects merchants and consumers with 435 million active accounts (consisting of 400 million consumer active accounts and 35 million merchant active accounts) across more than 200 markets as of December 31, 2022. We offer our customers the flexibility to use their PayPal or Venmo accounts to purchase and receive payments for goods and services, as well as the ability to transfer and withdraw funds. We enable consumers to exchange funds more safely with merchants using a variety of funding sources, which may include a bank account, a PayPal or Venmo account balance, PayPal and Venmo branded credit products including our installment products, a credit card, a debit card, certain cryptocurrencies, or other stored value products such as gift cards, and eligible rewards. Our PayPal, Venmo, and Xoom products also make it safer and simpler for friends and family to transfer funds to each other. We offer merchants an end-to-end payments solution that provides authorization and settlement capabilities, as well as instant access to funds and payouts. We also help merchants connect with their customers, process exchanges and returns, and manage risk. We help reduce the friction typically involved in cross-border commerce by offering consumers a simple payment experience and by enabling merchants to extend their reach to consumers in the global markets in which our services are available. We earn revenues primarily by charging fees for completing payment transactions for our customers and other payment-related services, which are typically based on the volume of activity processed on our payments platform. We also generate revenue from customers on fees charged for foreign currency conversion, for instant transfers from their PayPal or Venmo account to their bank account or debit card, and to facilitate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies; however, we generally do not charge customers to fund or draw from their accounts. We also earn revenue by providing other value added services, which are comprised primarily of revenue earned through partnerships, interest and fees from our merchant and consumer credit products, interest earned on certain assets underlying customer balances, referral fees, subscription fees, and gateway services. 5 KEY PERFORMANCE METRICS We measure the scale of our platform and the relevance of our products and services to our customers through certain metrics, including total payment volume, payment transactions, and active accounts:Total payment volume (“TPV”) is the value of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions.Number of payment transactions are the total number of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions.An active account is an account registered directly with PayPal or a platform access partner that has completed a transaction on our platform, not including gateway-exclusive transactions, within the past 12 months. A platform access partner is a third party whose customers are provided access to PayPal’s platform or services through such third-party’s login credentials, including individuals and entities that utilize Hyperwallet’s payout capabilities. A user may register on our platform to access different products and may register more than one account to access a product. Accordingly, a user may have more than one active account. The number of active accounts provides management with additional perspective on the overall scale of our platform, but may not have a direct relationship to our operating results. OUR STRENGTHS Our business is built on a strong foundation designed to drive growth and differentiate us from our competitors. A critical element of our overall growth strategy involves increasing the engagement of our active accounts, which we expect will contribute to growth in payment transactions, total payment volume, and net revenues. We believe that our competitive strengths include the following:•Two-sided network—our payments platform connecting merchants and consumers enables PayPal to offer unique end-to-end product experiences while gaining valuable insights into how our customers use our platform. Our payments platform provides for digital and in-store (at the point of sale) transactions while being both technology and platform agnostic.•Merchant and consumer choice—our branded and unbranded card processing payment solutions support an open ecosystem that provides choice to both merchants and consumers, enabling flexibility to make and receive payments using a wide variety of different funding options and digital wallet solutions. 6 •Scale—our global scale helps us to drive organic growth. As of December 31, 2022, we had 435 million active accounts, consisting of 400 million consumer active accounts and 35 million merchant active accounts in more than 200 markets around the world. A market is a geographic area or political jurisdiction, such as a country, territory, or protectorate, in which we offer some or all of our products and services. A country, territory, or protectorate is identified by a distinct set of laws and regulations. In 2022, we processed $1.36 trillion of TPV.•Trusted brands—we have built and strengthened well-recognized and trusted brands, including PayPal, Braintree, Venmo, Xoom, Hyperwallet, PayPal Zettle, PayPal Honey, and Paidy. Our communications and marketing efforts across multiple geographies and demographic groups play an important role in building brand visibility, usage, and overall preference among customers. •Risk and compliance management—our enterprise risk and compliance management program is designed to help secure customer information and to help ensure we process legitimate transactions around the world, while identifying and minimizing illegal, high-risk, or fraudulent transactions.•Regulatory licenses—we believe that our regulatory licenses, which enable us to operate in markets around the world, are a distinct advantage and help support business growth. MERCHANT AND CONSUMER PAYMENT SOLUTIONS During 2022, we reorganized our product organization to better align with merchants and consumers to help simplify decision making and enable our teams to innovate and launch new products and features more quickly and efficiently. Merchant value proposition We partner with our merchants to help grow and expand their businesses by providing global reach and powering all aspects of digital checkout. We offer alternative payment methods (including access to credit solutions), provide fraud prevention and risk management solutions, reduce merchant losses through proprietary protection programs, and offer tools and insights for utilizing data analytics to attract and engage customers and improve sales conversion. We employ a technology and platform agnostic approach intended to enable merchants of all sizes to quickly and easily provide digital checkout online, including through PayPal-branded checkout and unbranded card processing (primarily consisting of Braintree), as well as in-store at the point of sale, across all platforms and devices, and to securely and simply receive payments from their customers. 7 PayPal’s payments platform enables merchants to accept all types of online and offline payments, including those made with the PayPal and Venmo digital wallets, our consumer credit products, credit cards and debit cards, and competing digital wallets, as well as other popular local payment methods. Our diversified suite of products and services is tailored to meet the needs of merchants regardless of their size or business complexity. We have expanded our merchant value proposition to enable payment acceptance at the point of sale through our PayPal and Venmo digital wallets and our PayPal Zettle point of sale solutions. We aim to offer a seamless, omni-channel solution that helps merchants manage and grow their business. Through our consumer-focused offerings, we provide simplified and personalized shopping experiences for consumers, including easier exchanges and returns, to help merchants drive increased conversion through higher consumer engagement.We offer access to merchant finance products for certain small and medium-sized businesses through the PayPal Working Capital and PayPal Business Loan products, which we collectively refer to as our merchant finance offerings. The PayPal Working Capital product allows businesses to access a loan or cash advance for a fixed fee and based on their annual payment volume processed by PayPal. The PayPal Business Loan product provides businesses with short-term financing for a fixed fee based on an evaluation of both the applying business as well as the business owner. In the United States (“U.S.”), these products are provided under a program agreement with an independent chartered financial institution. We believe that our merchant finance offerings enable us to deepen our engagement with our existing small and medium-sized merchants and expand services to new merchants by providing access to capital that may not be available from traditional banks or other lending providers. We generate revenues from merchants primarily by charging fees for completing their payment transactions and other payment-related services. We also earn revenues from interest and fees earned on our merchant loans receivables. Consumer value proposition We focus on providing affordable, convenient, and secure consumer financial products and services intended to democratize the management and movement of money. We provide consumers with a digital wallet that enables them to send payments to merchants more safely using a variety of funding sources, which may include a bank account, a PayPal or Venmo account balance, our consumer credit products, a credit card, a debit card, certain cryptocurrencies, or other stored value products such as gift cards, and eligible rewards. Our goal is to create the simplest checkout experience possible for consumers both online and on mobile devices.We also offer consumers P2P payment solutions through our PayPal, Venmo, and Xoom products and services. We enable both domestic and international P2P transfers across our payments platform. Our Venmo digital wallet in the U.S. is a leading mobile application used to move money between our customers and to make purchases at select merchants. Our Xoom international money transfer service enables our customers to send money to people around the world in a secure, fast, and cost-effective way. P2P is an important source of customer engagement and also serves as a customer acquisition channel that facilitates organic growth by enabling potential users to establish active accounts with PayPal or Venmo at the time they make or receive a P2P payment. We also focus on simplifying and personalizing shopping experiences for our consumers by offering tools for product discovery, price tracking, offers, convenient tracking and redemption options for their shopping rewards, and easier exchanges and returns, which help our merchants to increase consumer engagement and sales conversion.We offer credit products to consumers in certain markets as a funding source at checkout, subject to approval of credit for the account holder. Our consumer credit offerings include our buy now, pay later products in the U.S., United Kingdom (“U.K.”), France, and Germany, among others, and in Japan through Paidy. A key attribute of our buy now, pay later products is the absence of interest or consumer late fees for missed payments in most of the geographies where we offer them. Further, we offer consumer interest-bearing installment products for consumers in the U.S., issued by an independent chartered financial institution, and in Germany. In the U.S., consumers may apply for our PayPal- and Venmo-branded consumer credit cards and our PayPal Credit revolving consumer credit product, which are offered through a partnership with an independent chartered financial institution. We offer a PayPal-issued PayPal Credit product in the U.K. We believe that our consumer credit products help enable us to increase engagement with consumers and merchants on our two-sided network. We have expanded our consumer value proposition through enhancements to the PayPal and Venmo digital wallets, which provide functionality to enable consumers to more easily checkout, explore deals and offers, track and redeem rewards, and to transact with cryptocurrencies, including buying, holding, selling, sending, and receiving them in certain markets. Our goal is to drive increased consumer engagement by providing consumers with a comprehensive set of services to manage their finances and enhance their ability to shop online and in person. 8 We generate revenue from consumers on: fees charged for foreign currency conversion, instant transfers from their PayPal or Venmo account to their bank account or debit card, and to facilitate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies; interest, fees, or other revenue from our credit products; and other miscellaneous fees. PROTECTING MERCHANTS AND CONSUMERS Protecting merchants and consumers on our payments platform from financial and fraud loss is important to successfully competing and sustainably growing our business. Fraudulent activities, such as account takeover, identity theft (including stolen financial information), and malicious activities by counterparties, represent a significant risk to merchants and consumers, as well as their payment partners. We provide merchants and consumers with protection programs for certain purchase transactions completed on our payments platform. We believe that these programs, which help protect both merchants and consumers from financial loss resulting from fraud and counterparty non-performance, are generally consistent with or broader than protections provided by other participants in the payments industry. Our protection programs are designed to promote confidence on both the part of consumers, who will only be required to pay in certain circumstances, such as receiving their purchased item in the condition significantly as described, and merchants, who will receive payment for delivering an item to the customer.Our ability to help protect both merchants and consumers is based largely on our proprietary, end-to-end payments platform and our ability to utilize the data from both sides of transactions on our two-sided network, specifically from buyers and sellers and from senders and receivers of payments. Our ongoing investment in systems and processes is designed to enhance the safety and security of our products and reflects our goal of having PayPal recognized as one of the world’s most trusted payments brands. COMPETITION The global payments industry is highly competitive, dynamic, highly innovative, and increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny and oversight. Many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with innovative and disruptive technologies, shifting user preferences and needs, price sensitivity of merchants and consumers, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Competition also may intensify as new competitors emerge, businesses enter into business combinations and partnerships, and established companies in other segments expand to become competitive with various aspects of our business.We compete with a wide range of businesses. Some of our current and potential competitors are or may be larger than we are, have larger customer bases, greater brand recognition, longer operating histories, a dominant or more secure position, broader geographic scope, volume, scale, resources, and market share than we do, or offer products and services that we do not offer. Other competitors are or may be smaller or younger companies that may be more agile in responding to regulatory and technological changes and customer preferences. We differentiate ourselves to merchants through our ability to innovate and develop products and services that offer new payment experiences for our merchants, demonstrate that they may achieve incremental sales by using and offering our services to consumers, support transactions on our payments platform across varied technologies and payment methods, through the simplicity and transparency of our fee structure, our seller protection programs, analytics, and risk management, as well as other merchant services. In addition, we differentiate ourselves to consumers through the ability to use our products and services across multiple commerce channels, including e-commerce, mobile, and payments at the point of sale, and without sharing their financial information with the merchant or any other party they are paying; our customer service, dispute resolution, and purchase protection programs; and our ability to simplify and personalize shopping experiences. We invest resources towards improving our products and services, offering choice in payment options, providing excellent customer service, and building brands that merchants and consumers trust. 9 Our business faces competition from a wide range of businesses and from all forms of physical and electronic payments. We face competition from banks and financial institutions, which provide traditional payment methods (particularly credit cards and debit cards (collectively, “payment cards”), electronic bank transfers, and credit), payment networks that facilitate payments for payment cards or proprietary retail networks, payment card processors, and “card on file” services. We also face competition from providers offering a variety of payment products and services, including tokenized and contactless payment cards, digital wallets and mobile payments solutions, credit, installment or other buy now pay later methods, real-time payment systems, P2P payments and money remittance services, card readers and other devices or technologies for payment at point of sale, virtual currencies and distributed ledger technologies, and tools that simplify and personalize shopping experiences for consumers and merchants. Our products and services face competition from all forms of payments, which include paper-based payments (primarily cash and checks), credit cards, debit cards, electronic bank transfers, account-to-account payments, credit, installment methods, digital wallets and mobile payment solutions, contactless payments (including contactless cards, tokenized cards, Near Field Communication (NFC) based solutions, and Quick Response (QR) code-based solutions), and virtual currencies, such as cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. In addition to the discussion in this section, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” under the caption “We face substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry” for further discussion of the potential impact of competition on our business. STRATEGY Our ability to grow revenue is affected by, among other things, the macroeconomic environment and its impact on consumer spending patterns, merchant and consumer adoption of digital payment methods, the expansion of multiple commerce channels, the growth of mobile devices and merchant and consumer applications on those devices, the growth of consumers globally with internet and mobile access, the pace of transition from cash and checks to digital forms of payment, our share of the digital payments market, and our ability to innovate and introduce new products, services, and features that merchants and consumers value. Our strategy to drive growth in our business includes the following:•Growing our core business: through expanding our global capabilities, customer base and scale, increasing our customers’ engagement and use of our products and services by better addressing their everyday needs to access, manage, and move money, creating seamless checkout experiences, and expanding the adoption of our solutions by merchants and consumers;•Expanding our value proposition for merchants and consumers: by being technology and platform agnostic, partnering with our merchants to grow and expand their business online and in-store, and providing consumers with simple, secure, and flexible ways to manage and move money across different markets, merchants, and platforms, and simplifying their shopping experiences; •Forming and expanding strategic partnerships: by building new strategic partnerships and deepening existing ones to provide better experiences for our customers, offer greater choice and flexibility, acquire new customers, and reinforce our role in the payments ecosystem; and•Seeking new areas of growth: organically and through acquisitions and strategic investments in our existing and new international markets and focusing on innovation in both the digital and physical world. ESG MANAGEMENT PayPal is committed to creating a more inclusive global economy and advancing our core values of Inclusion, Innovation, Collaboration, and Wellness across our communities, workforce, and strategies. We manage priority ESG risks and opportunities organized across four key pillars: (1) employees and culture, (2) social innovation, (3) environmental sustainability, and (4) responsible business practices. We believe this integrated, enterprise-wide approach to managing our global business responsibly helps to enable us to create value for all our stakeholders, including our stockholders, employees, partners, and communities. We continue to advance and prioritize efforts to manage key non-financial factors critical to our long-term business, including progress on our science-based approach to reducing our climate change impacts, targeted investments and partnerships to address the racial wealth gap and empower underserved communities and businesses, ongoing programmatic development intended to foster an inclusive culture across the employee experience, and further enhancements to support the safety and security of our products and platform. We take this commitment seriously and endeavor to provide transparent disclosures on our progress through our annual Global Impact Report and other communications. 10 TECHNOLOGY Our payments platform utilizes a combination of proprietary and third-party technologies and services intended to facilitate transactions efficiently and securely between millions of merchants and consumers worldwide across different channels, markets, and networks. Our payments platform connects with financial service providers around the world and allows consumers to make purchases using a wide range of payment methods, regardless of where a merchant is located. Consumers who use our payments platform can send payments in more than 200 markets around the world and in nearly 150 currencies, withdraw funds to their bank accounts in 56 currencies, and hold balances in their PayPal accounts in 25 currencies. We have developed intuitive user interfaces, customer tools, transaction management databases, and payment network integrations on our platform designed to enable our customers to utilize our suite of products and services. Our payments platform, open application programming interfaces, and developer tools are designed to enable developers to innovate with ease and offer robust solutions to our global ecosystem of merchants and consumers, while at the same time helping to maintain the security of our customers’ information. The technology infrastructure supporting our payments platform is designed to simplify the storage and processing of large amounts of data and facilitate the deployment and operation of large-scale global products and services in both our own data centers and when hosted by third-party cloud service providers. Our technology infrastructure is designed around industry best practices intended to reduce downtime and help ensure the resiliency of our payments platform in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences. Our payments platform incorporates multiple layers of protection for business continuity and system redundancy purposes and to help mitigate cybersecurity risks. We have a comprehensive cybersecurity program designed to protect our technology infrastructure and payments platform against cybersecurity threats, which includes regularly testing our systems to identify and address potential vulnerabilities. We strive to continually improve our technology infrastructure and payments platform to enhance the customer experience and to increase efficiency, scalability, and security. For additional information regarding risks relating to our technology infrastructure and cybersecurity, see the information in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” under the captions “Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to our reputation, business, and financial condition” and “Business interruptions or systems failures may impair the availability of our websites, applications, products or services, or otherwise harm our business.” RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Our total research and development expense was $1.7 billion, $1.6 billion, and $1.4 billion in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY The protection of our intellectual property, including our trademarks, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, patents, and trade secrets, is important to the success of our business. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on applicable laws, regulations, and administrative procedures in the U.S. and internationally. We have registered our core brands as domain names and as trademarks in the U.S. and many international jurisdictions. We also have an active program to secure and enforce trademarks and domain names that correspond to our brands in markets of interest. We have filed and continue to file patent applications in the U.S. and in international jurisdictions covering certain aspects of our proprietary technology and new innovations. We also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights when offering or procuring products and services. We routinely enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and non-disclosure agreements with parties with whom we conduct business to control access to, and use and disclosure of, our proprietary information.For additional information regarding risks relating to our intellectual property, see the information in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” under the captions “Third parties may allege that we are infringing their patents and other intellectual property rights” and “We may be unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property.” 11 GOVERNMENT REGULATION We operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened focus by regulators globally on all aspects of the payments industry, including countering terrorist financing, anti-money laundering, privacy, cybersecurity, and consumer protection. The laws and regulations applicable to us, including those enacted prior to the advent of digital payments, continue to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation. New or changing laws and regulations, including changes to their interpretation and implementation, as well as increased penalties and enforcement actions related to non-compliance, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We monitor these areas closely and are focused on designing compliant solutions for our customers.Government regulation impacts key aspects of our business. We are subject to the laws and regulations applicable to the payments industry in the markets we operate, which are subject to interpretation and change.Payments regulation. Various laws and regulations govern the payments industry in the U.S. and internationally. In the U.S., PayPal, Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary) holds licenses to operate as a money transmitter (or its equivalent) in the states where such licenses are required, as well as in the District of Columbia and certain territories. These licenses include not only the PayPal-branded products and services offered in these locations, but also our Venmo, Hyperwallet, and Xoom products and services to the extent offered in these locations. As a licensed money transmitter, PayPal is subject to, among other requirements, restrictions with respect to the investment of customer funds, reporting requirements, bonding requirements, and inspection by state regulatory agencies. In certain cases, these licenses also generally cover PayPal’s service enabling customers to buy, hold, transfer, and sell cryptocurrency directly from their PayPal or Venmo account. In the State of New York, PayPal holds a full Bitlicense issued by the New York Department of Financial Services to offer cryptocurrency services in the state. Outside the U.S., we provide similar services customized for various countries and foreign jurisdictions through our foreign subsidiaries. The activities of those non-U.S. entities are, or may be, supervised by a financial regulatory authority in the jurisdictions in which they operate. Among other regulatory authorities, the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (the “CSSF”), the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, the People’s Bank of China, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Reserve Bank of India, the Central Bank of Russia, and the Central Bank of Brazil have asserted jurisdiction over some or all of our activities in their respective jurisdictions. This list is not exhaustive, and there are numerous other regulatory agencies which have asserted or may assert jurisdiction over our activities.In addition, financial services regulators in various jurisdictions, including the U.S. and the European Union (“EU”), have implemented authentication requirements for banks and payment processors intended to reduce online fraud, which could impose significant costs, make it more difficult for new customers to open PayPal accounts, and reduce the ease of use of our products.Banking agency supervision. We serve our customers in the EU and U.K. through PayPal (Europe) S.à.r.l. et Cie, S.C.A. (“PayPal (Europe)”), a wholly-owned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a credit institution in Luxembourg by the CSSF. Under the U.K.’s Temporary Permissions Regime, PayPal is deemed to be authorized and regulated by the U.K. FCA as a result of Brexit. Consequently, we must comply with rules and regulations of the European banking industry, including those related to capitalization, funds management, corporate governance, anti-money laundering, disclosure, reporting, and inspection. We are, or may be, subject to banking-related regulations in other countries now or in the future related to our role in the financial industry. In addition, based on our relationships with our partner financial institutions, we are, or may be, subject to indirect regulation and examination by the regulators of these partner financial institutions.Lending regulation. Our U.S. consumer short-term, interest-free, installment product is subject to federal and state laws governing consumer credit and debt collection. PayPal holds multiple state licenses as the lender of this product. Paidy, Inc. holds multiple licenses for the issuance of its consumer installment products in Japan and is registered with the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry as a Comprehensive Credit Purchase Intermediary. In Australia, PayPal Credit Pty Limited offers a consumer short-term, interest-free, installment product that is exempt from regulation by the primary consumer credit legislation, but is subject to other laws which cover the provision of financial services, credit reporting, debt collection, and privacy. PayPal’s consumer short-term, interest-free, installment products in the U.K., France, Germany, Spain, and Italy are generally exempt from primary consumer credit legislation; however, certain consumer lending laws, consumer protection, and banking transparency regulations apply to this activity. 12 Our U.S. consumer interest-bearing installment product is subject to federal and state laws and is offered by an independent chartered financial institution. PayPal’s interest-bearing installment product for consumers in Germany is subject to applicable local laws such as consumer (lending) laws, consumer protection, or banking transparency regulations. These loans are originated by PayPal (Europe). PayPal and Venmo co-branded consumer credit cards and the PayPal Credit revolving consumer credit product are issued by an independent chartered financial institution in the U.S., and are subject to laws and regulations governing these programs. PayPal Credit in the U.K. is a regulated, revolving consumer credit product subject to applicable local laws and regulations.Our U.S. merchant lending products are subject to federal and state regulations and are offered by an independent chartered financial institution. Our merchant lending products offered in Germany, France and the Netherlands are subject to the laws of Luxembourg and certain local laws, and our merchant lending product offered in the U.K. is subject to U.K. regulation. The loans offered to European and U.K. merchants are originated by PayPal (Europe). Our merchant lending product in Australia is subject to the laws of Australia and originated by PayPal Credit Pty Limited.Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). The CFPB has significant authority to regulate consumer financial products in the U.S., including consumer credit, deposits, payments, and similar products. As a large market participant of remittance transfers, the CFPB has direct supervisory authority over our business. The CFPB and similar regulatory agencies in other jurisdictions may have broad consumer protection mandates that could result in the promulgation and interpretation of rules and regulations that may affect our business. Anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, and sanctions. PayPal is subject to anti-money laundering (“AML”) laws and regulations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, as well as laws designed to prevent the use of the financial systems to facilitate terrorist activities. Our AML program is designed to prevent our payments platform from being used to facilitate money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit activities, or to do business in countries or with persons and entities included on designated country or person lists promulgated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls and equivalent authorities in other countries. Our AML and sanctions compliance programs, overseen by our AML/Bank Secrecy Act Officer, are composed of policies, procedures, and internal controls, and are designed to address these legal and regulatory requirements and assist in managing money laundering and terrorist financing risks.Interchange fees. Interchange fees associated with four-party payments systems are being reviewed or challenged in various jurisdictions. For example, in the EU, the Multilateral Interchange Fee Regulation caps interchange fees for credit and debit card payments and provides for business rules to be complied with by any company dealing with payment card transactions, including PayPal. As a result, the fees that we collect in certain jurisdictions may become the subject of regulatory challenge.Data protection and privacy. We are subject to a number of laws, rules, directives, and regulations (“privacy and data protection laws”) relating to the collection, use, retention, security, processing, and transfer (collectively, “processing”) of personally identifiable information about our customers, our merchants’ customers, and employees (“personal data”) in the countries where we operate. Our business relies on the processing of personal data in many jurisdictions and the movement of data across national borders. As a result, much of the personal data that we process, which may include certain financial information associated with individuals, is subject to one or more privacy and data protection laws in one or more jurisdictions. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between or among us, our subsidiaries, and other parties with which we have commercial relationships.Regulatory scrutiny of privacy, data protection, cybersecurity practices, and the processing of personal data is increasing around the world. Regulatory authorities are continuously considering numerous legislative and regulatory proposals and interpretive guidelines that may contain additional privacy and data protection obligations. Many jurisdictions in which we operate have adopted, or are in the process of adopting, or amending data privacy legislation or regulation aimed at creating and enhancing individual privacy rights. In addition, the interpretation and application of these privacy and data protection laws in the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere are subject to change and may subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny and business costs.Anti-corruption. PayPal is subject to applicable anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Anti-corruption laws generally prohibit offering, promising, giving, accepting, or authorizing others to provide anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to or from a government official or private party in order to influence official action or otherwise gain an unfair business advantage, such as to obtain or retain business. We have implemented policies, procedures, and internal controls that are designed to comply with these laws and regulations. 13 Additional regulatory developments. Various regulatory agencies continue to examine and implement laws governing a wide variety of issues, including virtual currencies, identity theft, account management guidelines, disclosure rules, cybersecurity, competition, and marketing, which may impact PayPal’s business. Certain governments around the world are adopting laws and regulations pertaining to ESG performance, transparency, and reporting, including those related to general corporate ESG disclosures (e.g., the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive) as well as topical reporting and risk management requirements, such as obligations related to the management of climate-related risks.For an additional discussion on governmental regulation affecting our business, please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” included in this Form 10-K. HUMAN CAPITAL At PayPal, we consider the management of our global talent (human capital) to be essential to the ongoing success of our business. As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 29,900 people globally, with 44% in the Americas, 43% in Asia-Pacific, and 13% in Europe and the Middle East. Our global employees work predominantly full-time and represent nearly 150 nationalities, across 27 countries, including approximately 11,800 located in the U.S. Attracting, recruiting, developing, and retaining diverse talent enables us to provide our customers with products and services that help them to thrive in the global economy, and serve our other stakeholders. In 2022, we developed 12 leadership principles based on our four core values that establish a common set of expectations for all employees. We began integrating these principles across our global talent strategy to help shape our programs throughout the employee lifecycle and achieve key business priorities. We also remain focused on promoting the physical, mental, and financial wellness of our employees, particularly as our workforce continues to navigate changes in where and how we work. 14 Employee engagement We use employee feedback to directly inform the ongoing development of our employee programs. In addition to administering an annual survey to gather input from our global workforce, we also conducted specific surveys to gather direct employee feedback on our internal communications approach and evolving workplace preferences. For our 2022 annual employee survey, we heard from 83% of our global employees. Our engagement score, which reflects employees that would recommend PayPal to their peers and/or are happy at PayPal was 79%. Our score measuring intent to stay was 78%, which reflects an employee’s expectation to remain employed with the company in two years. Additionally, we observed improvements in employee scores regarding collaboration and manager support. In 2022, we enhanced our survey to incorporate viewpoints on the employee experience, diversity, inclusion, equity, and belonging (“DIE&B”) efforts, and our leadership principles, including specific questions on working style and strategic direction. The detailed scores are shared across the organization and analyzed to understand differences by geography, demographics, business function, and job level, and to help identify opportunities for further improvement. Talent acquisition, development, and retention As a leading technology platform that enables digital payments and simplifies commerce experiences, we compete for top global talent around the world. We believe that a strong culture focused on employee experiences that enables advancement, learning, and individual career insights is essential to the successful acquisition, development, and retention of diverse talent. Accordingly, we have implemented programs focused on inclusive hiring practices and extending our talent pipeline through targeted partnerships, reimagined our career development program for individuals and managers, extended individual coaching and mentorship programs (particularly for underrepresented and technical talent), and advanced efforts for employees to grow through self-paced and community learning experiences. Employee wellness We remain focused on promoting the holistic well-being of our employees, including resources, programs, and services to support our employees’ physical, mental, and financial wellness. In 2022, our initiatives included extending our Global Wellness Days for all employees to take time to rest and recharge, providing resources, trainings, and workshops to foster emotional well-being, preserving workplace flexibility through Crisis Leave and other programs, and strategically extending employee benefits to additional global markets. We also continued our efforts to strengthen employee financial wellness, including offering individual employee financial coaching, promoting the prioritization of employee financial health across the private sector through the Worker Financial Wellness Initiative, and improving our internal measurement and evaluation approaches to identify targeted opportunities for further enhancements. Through our global community impact program, we support our employees’ individual passions and communities by matching eligible employee donations and volunteer time with non-profit organizations up to $2,500 annually per employee. Diversity, inclusion, equity, and belonging We believe that fostering DIE&B is critical to our global talent strategy and pivotal to building a culture that embraces individual characteristics, values diversity, minimizes barriers, and enhances feelings of security and support across the workplace. We are committed to equal pay for equal work, promoting enterprise-wide inclusive learning opportunities, and partnering with leading organizations to embed DIE&B considerations into our talent strategy. We believe that our strong commitment to DIE&B is evident at all levels of the organization from our Board of Directors to our executive leadership team to our global workforce. As of December 31, 2022, 50% of our Board and 64% of our senior leadership team identified as women and/or from a diverse ethnic group. Across our workforce, we reached 56% overall diverse workforce representation, including 44% global gender diversity (inclusive of self-identified women and non-binary employees), and 54% U.S. ethnic diversity, as of December 31, 2022. Additional U.S. workforce diversity metrics can be found in our public EEO-1 reports and annual Global Impact Report available at https://about.pypl.com/values-in-action/reporting/default.aspx. 15 Workforce representation is only one aspect of our broader DIE&B strategy. Through the leadership of our Global Head of DIE&B and dedicated DIE&B team, along with functional collaboration and accountability, we are focused on strengthening existing efforts and piloting new initiatives to promote an inclusive culture. In 2022, we continued our support for underrepresented communities and employees through activities such as enhanced strategic partnerships, new learning modules to promote effective sponsorship and inclusive performance management, and new tools and resources to incorporate DIE&B considerations across the business. We continue to evaluate DIE&B progress across the company and as part of the individual performance assessment under our 2022 annual incentive plan for our senior executives. In addition, we empower eight employee resource groups to promote community and belonging for employees that identify as Black, Latinx/Hispanic, women, interfaith, veterans, LGBTQ+, Asian, and disabled persons and their allies. These groups drive ongoing employee engagement around the world for all employees, regardless of background, to support and champion their peers and related causes. Our evolving workplace We remain focused on creating a culture of flexibility and community by designing ways to collaborate across diverse workplace models, whether working virtually, on-site, or using a hybrid approach. We empower functional leadership to determine the most appropriate workplace strategy for their teams to optimize employee productivity and engagement and deliver on business priorities. Across PayPal, we are focused on providing tools and resources to support our diverse and distributed teams. We believe this flexible approach has broadened our potential global talent pools.As part of our annual ESG reporting, we provide additional information on our global talent strategy, including detailed representation metrics, in our Global Impact Report.

RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, in addition to other information appearing in this Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, for important information regarding risks and uncertainties that could affect us. These risk factors do not identify all risks we face, and additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, future prospects, and the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected. CYBERSECURITY AND TECHNOLOGY RISKS Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to our reputation, business, and financial condition. The techniques used to attempt to obtain unauthorized or illegal access to systems and information (including customers’ personal data), disable or degrade service, exploit vulnerabilities, or sabotage systems are constantly evolving. In some circumstances, these attempts may not be recognized or detected until after they have been launched against a target. Unauthorized parties will continue to attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means, including through hacking into our systems or facilities or those of our customers, partners, or vendors, and attempting to fraudulently induce users of our systems (including employees, vendor and partner personnel and customers) into disclosing user names, passwords, payment card information, multi-factor authentication application access or other sensitive information used to gain access to such systems or facilities. This information may, in turn, be used to access our customers’ confidential personal or proprietary information and financial instrument data that are stored on or accessible through our information technology systems and those of third parties with whom we partner. This information may also be used to execute fraudulent transactions or otherwise engage in fraudulent actions. Numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats, including advanced and persisting cyberattacks, cyberextortion, distributed denial-of-service attacks, ransomware, spear phishing and social engineering schemes, the introduction of computer viruses or other malware, and the physical destruction of all or portions of our information technology and infrastructure and those of third parties with whom we partner, are becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex, may be difficult to detect, and could compromise the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the data in our systems, as well as the systems themselves. We believe that cybercriminals may target PayPal due to our name, brand recognition, types of data (including sensitive payments- and identity-related data) that customers provide to us, and the widespread adoption and use of our products and services. We have experienced from time to time, and may experience in the future, breaches of our security measures due to human error, deception, malfeasance, insider threats, system errors, defects, vulnerabilities, or other irregularities. For example, in November 2017, we suspended the operations of TIO Networks (“TIO”) (acquired in July 2017) as part of an investigation of security vulnerabilities of the TIO platform, and in December 2017, we announced that we had identified evidence of unauthorized access to TIO’s network and the potential compromise of personally identifiable information for approximately 1.6 million TIO customers. Any cyberattacks or data security breaches affecting the information technology or infrastructure of companies we acquire or of our customers, partners, or vendors (including data center and cloud computing providers) could have similar negative effects. Under payment card network rules and our contracts with our payment processors, if there is a breach of payment card information stored by us or our direct payment card processing vendors, we could be liable to the payment card issuing banks, including for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses. Cybersecurity breaches and other exploited security vulnerabilities could subject us to significant costs and third-party liabilities, result in improper disclosure of data and violations of applicable privacy and other laws, require us to change our business practices, cause us to incur significant remediation costs, lead to loss of customer confidence in, or decreased use of, our products and services, damage our reputation and brands, divert the attention of management from the operation of our business, result in significant compensation or contractual penalties from us to our customers and their business partners as a result of losses to or claims by them, or expose us to litigation, regulatory investigations, and significant fines and penalties. While we maintain insurance policies intended to help offset the financial impact we may experience from these risks, our coverage may be insufficient to compensate us for all losses caused by security breaches and other damage to or unavailability of our systems. Business interruptions or systems failures may impair the availability of our websites, applications, products or services, or otherwise harm our business. Our systems and operations and those of our service providers and partners have experienced from time to time, and may experience in the future, business interruptions or degradation of service because of distributed denial-of-service and other 17 cyberattacks, insider threats, hardware and software defects or malfunctions, human error, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, and other natural disasters, public health crises (including pandemics), power losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist attacks, computer viruses or other malware, or other events. The frequency and intensity of weather events related to climate change are increasing, which could increase the likelihood and severity of such disasters as well as related damage and business interruption. Our corporate headquarters are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a seismically active region in California. A catastrophic event that could lead to a disruption or failure of our systems or operations could result in significant losses and require substantial recovery time and significant expenditures to resume or maintain operations. Further, some of our systems, including those of companies that we have acquired, are not fully redundant and any failure of these acquired systems, including due to a catastrophic event, may lead to operational outages or delays. While we engage in disaster recovery planning and testing intended to mitigate risks from outages or delays, our planning and testing may not be sufficient for all possible outcomes or events. As a provider of payments solutions, we are also subject to heightened scrutiny by regulators that may require specific business continuity, resiliency and disaster recovery plans, and rigorous testing of such plans, which may be costly and time-consuming to implement, and may divert our resources from other business priorities. Any of the foregoing risks could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, system failures, cyberattacks, unplanned outages, and other events or conditions from time to time that have and may interrupt the availability, or reduce or adversely affect the speed or functionality, of our products and services and result in loss of revenue. A prolonged interruption of, or reduction in, the availability, speed, or functionality of our products and services could materially harm our business. Frequent or persistent interruptions in our services could permanently harm our relationship with our customers and partners and our reputation. If any system failure or similar event results in damage to our customers or their business partners, they could seek significant compensation or contractual penalties from us for their losses. These claims, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and costly for us to address.We continue to undertake system upgrades and re-platforming efforts designed to improve the availability, reliability, resiliency, and speed of our payments platform. These efforts are costly and time-consuming, involve significant technical complexity and risk, may divert our resources from new features and products, and may ultimately not be effective. Frequent or persistent site interruptions could lead to regulatory scrutiny, significant fines and penalties, and mandatory and costly changes to our business practices, and ultimately could cause us to lose existing licenses that we need to operate or prevent or delay us from obtaining additional licenses that may be required for our business.We also rely on facilities, components, applications, software, and services supplied by third parties, including data center facilities and cloud data storage and processing services. From time to time, we have experienced interruptions in the provision of such facilities and services provided by these third parties. If these third parties experience operational interference or disruptions (including a cybersecurity incident), fail to perform their obligations, or breach their agreements with us, our operations could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected, which could result in customer dissatisfaction, regulatory scrutiny, and damage to our reputation and brands, and materially and adversely affect our business. While we maintain insurance policies intended to help offset the financial impact we may experience from these risks, our coverage may be insufficient to compensate us for all losses caused by interruptions in our service due to systems failures and similar events.In addition, any failure to successfully implement new information systems and technologies, or improvements or upgrades to existing information systems and technologies in a timely manner could adversely impact our business, internal controls, results of operations, and financial condition. If we cannot keep pace with rapid technological developments to provide new and innovative products and services, the use of our products and services and, consequently, our revenues, could decline. Rapid, significant, and disruptive technological changes impact the industries in which we operate, including payment technologies (including real-time payments, payment card tokenization, virtual currencies, distributed ledger and blockchain technologies, and proximity payment technology such as Near Field Communication and other contactless payments); internet browser technologies, that enable users to easily store their payment card information for use on any retail or e-commerce website; artificial intelligence and machine learning; developments in technologies supporting our regulatory and compliance obligations; and in-store, digital, and social commerce.We expect that new technologies applicable to the industries in which we operate will continue to emerge and may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies we currently use in our products and services. We cannot predict the effects of technological changes on our business, which technological developments or innovations will become widely adopted, and how 18 those technologies may be regulated. Developing and incorporating new technologies into new and existing products and services may require significant investment, take considerable time, and may not ultimately be successful. We rely in part on third parties, including some of our competitors, for the development of and access to new or evolving technologies. These third parties may restrict or prevent our access to, or utilization of, those technologies, as well as their platforms or products. Our ability to develop, provide or incorporate new technologies and adapt our existing products and services or develop future and new products and services using new technologies may be limited or restricted by industry-wide standards, platform providers, payments networks, changes to laws and regulations, changing customer expectations, third-party intellectual property rights, and other factors. If we are unable to develop and incorporate new technologies and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards in a timely or cost-effective manner, our business could be harmed. LEGAL, REGULATORY AND COMPLIANCE RISKS Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight. Our failure to comply with extensive, complex, overlapping, and frequently changing rules, regulations, and legal interpretations could materially harm our business. Our business is subject to complex and changing laws, rules, regulations, policies, and legal interpretations in the markets in which we offer services directly or through partners, including those governing: banking, credit, deposit taking, cross-border and domestic money transmission, prepaid access, foreign currency exchange, privacy, data protection, data governance, cybersecurity, banking secrecy, digital payments, cryptocurrency, payment services (including payment processing and settlement services), fraud detection, consumer protection, antitrust and competition, economic and trade sanctions, anti-money laundering, and counter-terrorist financing.Regulators globally are increasingly exercising regulatory authority, oversight, and enforcement in a manner that impacts our business. Further, as we introduce new products and services and expand into new markets (including through acquisitions) and expand and localize our international activities, we expect to become subject to additional regulations, restrictions, and licensing requirements. In addition, because we facilitate sales of goods and provide services to customers worldwide, one or more jurisdictions may claim that we or our customers are required to comply with their laws, which may impose different, more specific, or conflicting obligations on us, as well as broader liability. Any failure or alleged failure to comply with existing or new laws, regulations, or orders of any government authority (including changes to their interpretation) may subject us to significant fines and penalties, criminal and civil lawsuits, forfeiture of significant assets, and enforcement actions; result in additional compliance and licensure requirements; cause us to lose existing licenses or prevent or delay us from obtaining additional licenses that may be required for our business; increase regulatory scrutiny of our business; restrict or cease our operations; force us to make changes to our business practices, products or operations; lead to increased friction for customers; require us to engage in remediation activities; delay planned transactions, product launches or other activities, or divert management’s time and attention from our business. The complexity of United States (“U.S.”) federal and state and international regulatory and enforcement regimes, coupled with the global scope of our operations and the evolving global regulatory environment, could result in one or more events prompting a large number of overlapping investigations and legal and regulatory proceedings by multiple government authorities in different jurisdictions. While we have implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, and agents will not violate such laws and regulations. Any of the foregoing could, individually or in the aggregate, harm our reputation, damage our brands and business, and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Payments Regulation In the U.S., PayPal, Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary) holds licenses to operate as a money transmitter (or its equivalent) in the states where such licenses are required, as well as in the District of Columbia and certain territories. If we fail to comply with applicable laws or regulations required to maintain our licenses, we could be subject to liability and/or additional restrictions, forced to cease doing business with residents of certain states or territories, forced to change our business practices, or required to obtain additional licenses or regulatory approvals, which could impose substantial costs and harm our business. While we currently allow our customers to send payments from approximately 200 markets, we allow customers in only approximately half of those markets (including the U.S.) to also receive payments, in some cases with significant restrictions on the manner in which customers can hold balances or withdraw funds. These restrictions may limit our ability to grow our business.Outside of the U.S., we principally provide our services to customers in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) through PayPal (Europe), our wholly-owned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a credit 19 institution in Luxembourg. PayPal (Europe) may be subject to enforcement actions and significant fines if it violates applicable requirements. Additionally, compliance with applicable laws and regulations could become more costly and operationally difficult to manage due to potentially inconsistent interpretations and domestic regulations by various countries in the region. Applicable regulation relating to payments, anti-money laundering and digital services, which are key focus areas of regulators and subject to extensive new regulation, could subject us to additional and complex obligations, risks and associated costs. If the business activities of PayPal (Europe) exceed certain thresholds, or if the European Central Bank (“ECB”) so determines, PayPal (Europe) may be deemed a significant supervised entity and certain activities of PayPal (Europe) would become directly supervised by the ECB, rather than by the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier, which could subject us to additional requirements and would likely increase compliance costs. PayPal (Europe) is also subject to regulation by the ECB under the oversight framework for electronic payment instruments, schemes and arrangements (PISA), which may also lead to increased compliance obligations and costs.In many of the other markets outside the U.S. in which we do business, we serve our customers through PayPal Pte. Ltd., our wholly-owned subsidiary based in Singapore. PayPal Pte. Ltd. is supervised by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”). The Payment Services Act came into effect in Singapore in January 2020. PayPal Pte. Ltd. has submitted an application for a Major Payment Institution license to the MAS to continue to provide payments services, and is operating under an exemption from holding a license within a statutory transition period while the application is pending. Upon PayPal Pte. Ltd. obtaining this license, we will be required to comply with new regulatory requirements, which will result in increased operational complexity and costs for our Singapore and international operations. In many of the markets outside the U.S. (other than Singapore) served by PayPal Pte. Ltd. or by local branches or subsidiaries subject to local regulatory supervision or oversight, as the case may be, there may be uncertainty whether our Singapore-based service is subject only to Singapore law or also to other local laws, and whether such local laws might require a payment processor like us to be licensed as a payments service, bank, financial institution, or otherwise. There are substantial costs and potential product and operational changes involved in maintaining and renewing licenses, certifications, and approvals, and we could be subject to enforcement actions, fines, and litigation if we are found to violate any of these requirements. There can be no assurance that we will be able to (or decide to) continue to apply for or obtain any licenses, renewals, certifications, and approvals in any jurisdiction. In certain markets, we may need to rely on local banks or other partners to process payments and conduct foreign currency exchange transactions in local currency, and local regulators may use their authority over such local partners to prohibit, restrict, or limit us from doing business. Any of the foregoing could, individually or in the aggregate, result in substantial additional costs, delay or preclude planned transactions, product launches or improvements, require significant and costly operational changes, impose restrictions, limitations, or additional requirements on our business, products and services, or prevent or limit us from providing our products or services in a given market. Cryptocurrency Regulation and Related Risks Our current and planned customer cryptocurrency offerings could subject us to additional regulations, licensing requirements, or other obligations. Within the U.S., we are regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services as a virtual currency business, which does not qualify us to engage in securities brokerage or dealing activities. The regulatory status of particular cryptocurrencies is unclear under existing law. For example, if the SEC were to assert that any of the cryptocurrencies we support are securities, the SEC could assert that our activities involving that cryptocurrency require securities broker-dealer registration or other obligations under the federal securities laws. The rapidly evolving regulatory landscape with respect to cryptocurrency may subject us to additional licensing and regulatory obligations or to inquiries or investigations from the SEC, other regulators and governmental authorities, and require us to make product changes, restrict or discontinue product offerings, implement additional and potentially costly controls, or take other actions. If we fail to comply with regulations, requirements, prohibitions or other obligations applicable to us, we could face regulatory or other enforcement actions, potential fines, and other consequences.We hold our customers’ cryptocurrency assets through a third-party custodian. Financial and third-party risks related to our customer cryptocurrency offerings, such as inappropriate access to, theft, or destruction of cryptocurrency assets held by our custodian, insufficient insurance coverage by the custodian to reimburse us for all such losses, the custodian’s failure to maintain effective controls over the custody and settlement services provided to us, the custodian’s inability to purchase or liquidate cryptocurrency holdings, and defaults on financial or performance obligations by the custodian, or counterparty financial institutions, could expose our customers and us to loss, and therefore significantly harm our business, financial performance, and reputation. 20 We have selected a custodian partner, and may in the future select additional custodian partners, that are subject to regulatory oversight, capital requirements, maintenance of audit and compliance industry certifications, and cybersecurity procedures and policies. Nevertheless, operational disruptions at any such custodian, or such custodian’s failure to safeguard cryptocurrency holdings could result in losses of customer assets, expose us to customer claims, reduce consumer confidence and materially impact our operating results and our cryptocurrency product offerings.Custodial arrangements to safeguard cryptocurrency assets involve unique risks and uncertainties in the event of the custodian’s bankruptcy. While other types of assets and some custodied cryptocurrencies have been deemed not to be part of the custodian’s bankruptcy estate under various regulatory regimes, bankruptcy courts have not yet definitively determined the appropriate treatment of custodial holdings of digital assets in a bankruptcy proceeding. In the event of our custodian’s bankruptcy, the lack of precedent and the highly fact-dependent nature of the determination could delay or preclude the return of custodied cryptocurrency assets to us or to our customers. Although, we contractually require our custodian to segregate our customer assets and not commingle them with proprietary or other assets, we cannot be certain that these contractual obligations, even if duly observed by the custodian, will be effective in preventing such assets from being treated as part of the custodian’s estate under bankruptcy or other insolvency law. In that event, our claim on behalf of such customers against the custodian’s estate for our customers’ cryptocurrency assets could be treated as a general unsecured claim against the custodian, in which case our customers could seek to hold us liable for any resulting losses.In addition, our cryptocurrency product offerings could have the effect of heightening or exacerbating many of the risk factors described in this “Risk Factors” section. Lending Regulation We hold a number of U.S. state lending licenses for our U.S. consumer short-term installment loan product, which is subject to federal and state laws governing consumer credit and debt collection. While the consumer short-term installment loan products that we offer outside the U.S. are generally exempt from primary consumer credit legislation, certain consumer lending laws, consumer protection or banking transparency regulations continue to apply to these products. Increased global regulatory focus on short-term installment products and consumer credit more broadly could result in laws or regulations requiring changes to our policies, procedures, operations, and product offerings, and restrict or limit our ability to offer credit products, and we could be subject to enforcement action, fines, and litigation if we are found to violate any aspects of applicable law or regulations. Consumer Protection Violations of federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations, including the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (“EFTA”) and Regulation E as implemented by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), could result in the assessment of significant actual damages or statutory damages or penalties (including treble damages in some instances) and plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees. We are subject to, and have paid amounts in settlement of, lawsuits containing allegations that our business violated the EFTA and Regulation E or otherwise advance claims for relief relating to our business practices (e.g., that we improperly held consumer funds or otherwise improperly limited consumer accounts).In addition, the CFPB, pursuant to its market-monitoring authority, may require us to provide extensive information on our products and offerings from time to time. In 2021, we received separate orders from the CFPB pursuant to such market-monitoring authority requiring us to provide, among other items, extensive information on our payment products, including with respect to the collection, use of, and access to data and consumer protections, as well as our Buy Now, Pay Later offerings.PayPal principally offers its services in the EEA countries through a “passport” notification process through PayPal (Europe)’s Luxembourg regulator to regulators in other EEA member states in accordance with European Union (“EU”) regulations, as well as in the U.K. through the Temporary Permissions Regime. Regulators in these countries could notify us of and seek to enforce local consumer protection laws that apply to our business, in addition to Luxembourg consumer protection laws, or seek to persuade the local regulator to order PayPal to conduct its activities in the local country directly or through a branch office. These or similar actions by these regulators could impose additional obligations and costs and impact our ability to expand our business in Europe and the U.K. Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing; Economic and Trade Sanctions Regulators globally continue to increase standards and expectations regarding anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing, and to expand the scope of existing laws and regulations to emerging products and markets, which may require us to further revise or expand our compliance program globally and/or in specific jurisdictions, including the procedures we use to 21 verify the identity of our customers and to monitor international and domestic transactions. Such changes could have the effect of making compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage, lead to increased friction for customers, and result in a decrease in business. Regulators regularly re-examine the transaction volume thresholds at which we must obtain and keep applicable records or the circumstances in which we must verify identities of customers, and any change to such obligations could result in greater compliance costs and impact our business. We are also required to comply with economic and trade sanctions administered by the U.S., the EU and its member states, the U.K., and other jurisdictions in which we operate. Non-compliance with anti-money laundering laws and regulations or economic and trade sanctions may subject us to significant fines, penalties, lawsuits, and enforcement actions, result in regulatory sanctions and additional compliance requirements, increase regulatory scrutiny of our business, restrict our operations, and damage our reputation and brands. Our compliance history may be considered by OFAC and other regulators as part of any potential future investigation of our sanctions regulation. Privacy and Protection of Customer Data The legal and regulatory environment relating to privacy and data protection laws continues to develop and evolve in ways we cannot predict, including with respect to technologies such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, machine learning, cryptocurrency, and blockchain technology. Any failure or alleged failure by us to comply with our privacy policies as communicated to customers or with privacy and data protection laws could result in proceedings or actions against us by data protection authorities, other government agencies, or others, which could subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments, and negative publicity, require us to change our business practices, increase the costs and complexity of compliance, result in reputational harm, and materially harm our business. Compliance with inconsistent privacy and data protection laws may also restrict or limit our ability to provide products and services to our customers.PayPal relies on a variety of compliance methods to transfer personal data of EEA individuals to the U.S., including Binding Corporate Rules for internal transfers of certain types of personal data and Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”) as approved by the European Commission for transfers to and from third parties. In June 2021, the European Commission imposed new SCC requirements which impose certain contract and operational requirements on PayPal, its merchants, and vendors to adhere to certain affirmative duties, including requirements related to government access transparency, enhanced data subject rights, and broader third-party assessments to ensure safeguards necessary to protect personal data exported from PayPal’s EEA customers and/or employees to countries outside the EEA. To the extent we rely on SCCs, we will potentially need to enter into new contractual arrangements reflecting the updated SCC requirements to avoid limitations on PayPal’s ability to process EEA data in countries outside of the EEA.Many jurisdictions in which we operate globally have enacted, or are in the process of enacting, data privacy legislation or regulations aimed at creating and enhancing individual privacy rights. For example, numerous U.S. states have enacted or are in the process of enacting state level data privacy laws and regulations governing the collection, use, and retention of their residents’ personal information. The continued proliferation of privacy laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate is likely to result in a disparate array of privacy rules with unaligned or conflicting provisions, accountability requirements, individual rights, and national or local enforcement powers, which may subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny and business costs, and could lead to unintended consumer confusion. We are subject to regulatory scrutiny and may be subject to legal proceedings under antitrust and competition laws. We are subject to scrutiny by various government agencies regarding antitrust and competition laws and regulations in the U.S. and internationally, including in connection with proposed or implemented business combinations, acquisitions, investments, partnerships, commercial agreements and business practices. Some jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to assert claims of anticompetitive conduct. Companies and government agencies have in the past alleged, and may in the future allege, that our actions violate the antitrust or competition laws in the U.S. or other jurisdictions in which we operate or otherwise constitute unfair competition, or that our products and services are used so broadly that otherwise uncontroversial business practices could be deemed anticompetitive. Any claims or investigations, even if without merit, may be costly to defend or respond to, involve negative publicity, and cause substantial diversion of management’s time and effort, and could result in reputational harm, significant judgments, fines and other remedial actions against us, require us to change our business practices, make product or operational changes, or delay or preclude planned transactions, product launches or improvements. We are regularly subject to general litigation, regulatory scrutiny, and government inquiries. We are regularly subject to claims, individual and class action lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government and regulatory investigations, inquiries, actions or requests, and other proceedings alleging violations of laws, rules, and regulations with 22 respect to competition, antitrust, intellectual property, privacy, data protection, information security, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, sanctions, anti-bribery, anti-corruption, consumer protection (including unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices), fraud, accessibility, securities, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, services, charitable fundraising, contract disputes, escheatment of unclaimed or abandoned property, product liability, use of our services for illegal purposes, the matters described in “Note 13—Commitments and Contingencies—Litigation and Regulatory Matters—General Matters” to our consolidated financial statements, and other matters. The number and significance of these disputes and inquiries is expected to continue to increase as our products, services, and business expand in complexity, scale, scope, and geographic reach, including through acquisitions of businesses and technology. Investigations and legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, expensive and disruptive to our operations, and could result in substantial judgments, fines, penalties or settlements, negative publicity, substantial diversion of management’s time and effort, reputational harm, criminal sanctions, or orders that prevent or limit us from offering certain products or services; require us to change our business practices in costly ways, develop non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies, or pay substantial royalty or licensing fees; or delay or preclude planned transactions or product launches or improvements. Determining legal reserves or possible losses from such matters involves significant estimates and judgments and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes. We may be exposed to losses in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material. If any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Third parties may allege that we are infringing their patents and other intellectual property rights. We are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. Intellectual property infringement claims against us may result from, among other things, our expansion into new business areas, including through acquisitions of businesses and technology, or new or expanded products and services and their convergence with technologies not previously associated with areas related to our business, products, and services. The ultimate outcome of any allegation or claim is often uncertain and any such claim, with or without merit, may be time-consuming to defend, result in costly litigation, divert management’s time and attention from our business, result in reputational harm, and require us to, among other things, redesign or stop providing our products or services, pay substantial amounts to settle claims or lawsuits, satisfy judgments, or pay substantial royalty or licensing fees. We may be unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property. The protection of our proprietary rights, including our trademarks, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, patents and trade secrets, is important to the success of our business. Effective protection of our proprietary rights may not be available in every jurisdiction in which we offer our products and services. Although we have generally taken measures to protect our intellectual property, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in protecting or enforcing our rights in every jurisdiction, that our contractual arrangements will prevent or deter third parties from infringing or misappropriating our intellectual property, or that third parties will not independently develop equivalent or superior intellectual property rights. We may be required to expend significant time and resources to prevent infringement and enforce our rights, and we may be unable to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. If we are unable to prevent third parties from infringing or otherwise violating our proprietary rights, the uniqueness and value of our products and services could be adversely affected, the value of our brands could be diminished, and our business could be adversely affected. We expect to continue to license in the future certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to others. These licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation. Any failure to adequately protect or enforce our proprietary rights, or significant costs incurred in doing so, could diminish the value of our intangible assets and materially harm our business. BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS RISKS We face substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry. The global payments industry is highly competitive, dynamic, highly innovative, and increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny and oversight. Many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with innovative and disruptive technologies, shifting user preferences and needs, price sensitivity of merchants and consumers, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Competition also may intensify as new competitors emerge, businesses enter into business combinations and partnerships, and established companies in other segments expand to become competitive with various aspects of our business.We compete with a wide range of businesses in every aspect of our business. Some of our current and potential competitors are or may be larger than we are, have larger customer bases, greater brand recognition, longer operating histories, a dominant or more secure position, broader geographic scope, volume, scale, resources, and market share than we do, or offer products and 23 services that we do not offer. Other competitors are or may be smaller or younger companies that may be more agile in responding to regulatory and technological changes and customer preferences. Our competitors may devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of products and services, and/or offer lower prices or more effectively offer their own innovative programs, products, and services. We often partner with other businesses, and the ability to continue establishing these partnerships is important to our business. Competition for relationships with these partners is intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to establish, grow, or maintain these partner relationships. If we are unable to differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors, drive value for our customers, or effectively and efficiently align our resources with our goals and objectives, we may not be able to compete effectively. See “Item 1. Business—Competition” of this Form 10-K for further discussion of the competitive environment in the markets where we operate. Changes to payment card networks or bank fees, rules, or practices could harm our business. To process certain transactions, we must comply with applicable payment card, bank or other network (collectively, “network”) rules. The rules govern all aspects of a transaction on the networks, including fees and other practices. From time to time, the networks have increased the fees and assessments that they charge for transactions that access their networks. Certain networks have also imposed special fees or assessments for transactions that are executed through a digital wallet such as the one that PayPal offers. Our payment processors may have the right to pass any increases in fees and assessments on to us and to increase their own fees for processing. Any increase in interchange fees, special fees, or assessments for transactions that we pay to the networks or our payment processors could make our pricing less competitive, increase our operating costs, and reduce our operating income, which could materially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.In some jurisdictions, government regulations have required payment card networks to reduce or cap interchange fees. Any changes in interchange fee rates or limitations, or their applicability to PayPal, could adversely affect our competitive position against payment card service providers and the revenue we earn from our branded card programs, require us to change our business practices, and harm our business.We may also be subject to fines and other penalties assessed by networks resulting from any rule violations by us or our merchants. The networks set and interpret their rules and have alleged from time to time that various aspects of our business model violate these rules. Such allegations may result in significant fines, penalties, damages, or other liabilities or require changes in our business practices that may be costly and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The network rules may also increase the cost of, impose restrictions on, or otherwise impact the development of, our products which may negatively affect product deployment and adoption. The networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or re-interpret existing rules that we or our payment processors might find difficult or impractical to follow, or costly to implement, which could require us to make significant changes to our products, increase our operational costs, and negatively impact our business. If we become unable or limited in our ability to accept certain payment types such as debit or credit cards, our business would be materially and adversely affected. Changes in how consumers fund their PayPal transactions could harm our business. We pay transaction fees when consumers fund payment transactions using credit cards, lower fees when consumers fund payments with debit cards, and nominal fees when consumers fund payment transactions by electronic transfer of funds from bank accounts, from an existing PayPal account balance or Venmo account balance, or through our PayPal branded consumer credit products. Our financial performance is sensitive to changes in the rate at which our consumers fund payments using payment cards, which can significantly increase our costs. Although we provide consumers in certain markets with the opportunity to use their existing PayPal account balance or Venmo account balance to fund payment transactions, some of our consumers may prefer to use payment cards, which may offer features and benefits not provided as part of their PayPal accounts. Any increase in the portion of our payment volume funded using payment cards or in fees associated with our funding mix, or other events or developments that make it more difficult or costly for us to fund transactions with lower-cost funding options, could materially and adversely affect our financial performance and significantly harm our business. Our ability to receive the benefit of U.S. merchant financing offerings and certain U.S. installment loan products may be subject to challenge. Merchant loans under our U.S. PayPal Working Capital (“PPWC”) and PayPal Business Loan (“PPBL”) products and certain U.S. installment loan products are provided by a state-chartered industrial bank under a program agreement with us, and we acquire the receivables generated by those loans from the state-chartered bank after origination. In June 2020, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) approved a final rule clarifying that loans validly originated by state-chartered banks or insured branches of foreign banks remain valid throughout the lifetime of the loan, reflecting a similar rule finalized by the Office of the Comptroller of Currency (“OCC”) in May 2020 for nationally chartered banks. The final rule reaffirms and 24 codifies the so-called “valid-when-made doctrine,” which provides that the permissibility of an interest rate for a loan is determined when the loan is made and will not be affected by subsequent events such as sale, assignment, or other transfer. While a number of state attorneys general have unsuccessfully challenged these FDIC and OCC rules, there remains some uncertainty whether non-bank entities purchasing loan receivables originated by FDIC-insured, state-chartered banks may rely on federal preemption of state usury laws and other state laws. An adverse outcome of these or similar challenges, or changes to applicable laws and regulations or regulatory policy, could materially impact our U.S. PPWC, PPBL, certain installment products, and our business. Our credit products expose us to additional risks. We offer credit products to a wide range of consumers and merchants in the U.S. and various international markets. The financial success of these products depends largely on the effective management of related risk. The credit decision-making process for our consumer credit products uses proprietary methodologies and credit algorithms and other analytical techniques designed to analyze the credit risk of specific consumers based on, among other factors, their past purchase and transaction history with PayPal or Venmo and their credit scores. Similarly, proprietary risk models and other indicators are applied to assess merchants who desire to use our merchant financing offerings to help predict their ability to repay. These risk models may not accurately predict the creditworthiness of a consumer or merchant due to inaccurate assumptions, including those related to the particular consumer or merchant, market conditions, economic environment, or limited transaction history or other data. The accuracy of these risk models and the ability to manage credit risk related to our credit products may also be affected by legal or regulatory requirements, changes in consumer behavior, changes in the economic environment, issuing bank policies, and other factors. We generally rely on the activities and charters of unaffiliated financial institutions to provide PayPal and Venmo branded consumer credit and merchant financing offerings to our U.S. customers. As a service provider to these unaffiliated financial institutions, which are federally supervised U.S. financial institutions, we are subject from time to time to examination by their federal banking regulators. In the event of any termination or interruption in a partner bank’s ability or willingness to lend, our ability to offer consumer credit and merchant financing products could be interrupted or limited, which could materially and adversely affect our business. We may be unable to reach a similar arrangement with another unaffiliated financial institution on favorable terms or at all. Obtaining and maintaining the lending licenses required for us to originate such loans ourselves would be a costly, time-consuming and uncertain process, and would subject us to additional laws and regulatory requirements, which could significantly increase our costs and compliance obligations and require us to change our business practices.We are subject to the risk that account holders who use our credit products will default on their payment obligations, creating the risk of potential charge-offs or negatively impacting the revenue share arrangement with an independent chartered financial institution with respect to our U.S. consumer credit product. The non-payment rate among account holders may increase due to, among other factors, changes to underwriting standards, risk models not accurately predicting the creditworthiness of a user, worsening economic conditions, such as a recession or government austerity programs, increases in prevailing interest rates, and high unemployment rates. Account holders who miss payments often fail to repay their loans, and account holders who file for protection under the bankruptcy laws generally do not repay their loans. We currently purchase receivables related to our U.S. PayPal-branded merchant financing offerings and certain U.S. consumer installment loan products and extend credit for our consumer and merchant products outside the U.S. through our international subsidiaries. If we are unable to fund our credit products or the purchase of the receivables related to our credit products and offerings adequately or in a cost-effective manner, the growth of our credit products could be negatively impacted. We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk. We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, including networks, banks, payment processors, and payment gateways that link us to the payment card and bank clearing networks to process transactions; unaffiliated third-party lenders to originate our U.S. credit products to consumers, U.S. merchant financing, and branded credit card products; branded debit card and savings products issued by unaffiliated banks; cryptocurrency custodial service providers; and external business partners and contractors who provide key functions (e.g., outsourced customer support and product development functions; facilities; information technology, data center facilities and cloud computing). We are subject to additional risks inherent in engaging and relying upon third-party providers, including legal, regulatory, information security, reputational and operational risks. We are undertaking efforts to diversify our reliance on a small number of third-party payment processors in various markets. We are working with our primary payment processor in the U.S. to facilitate the migration of our arrangements to other payment processors over a transition period in connection with the wind-down of our agreement; however, if we are unable to timely and efficiently migrate our business to other payment processors or experience disruptions in connection with this transition, our business could be harmed. If we are unable to effectively manage our third-party relationships, these third parties are unable to 25 meet their obligations to us, or we experience substantial disruptions in these relationships, our operations, results of operations, and financial results could be adversely impacted. Additionally, our relationships with third parties inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, governance, and compliance, which potentially increases our financial, legal, reputational, and operational risk. Any factors that reduce cross-border trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business. Cross-border trade (i.e., transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries) is an important source of our revenues and profits. Cross-border transactions generally provide higher revenues and operating income than similar transactions that take place within a single country or market. In certain markets, cross-border trade represents our primary (and in some instances our only) presence. Cross-border trade may be negatively impacted by various factors including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, tariffs, trade barriers or restrictions, sanctions, import or export controls, and the interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions in the context of cross-border trade and foreign exchange. Any factors that increase the costs of cross-border trade for us or our customers or that restrict, delay, or make cross-border trade more difficult or impractical could reduce our cross-border transactions and volume, negatively impact our revenues and profits, and harm our business. Failure to deal effectively with fraud, abusive behaviors, bad transactions, and negative customer experiences may increase our loss rate and could negatively impact our business and severely diminish merchant and consumer confidence in and use of our services. We expect that third parties will continue to attempt to abuse access to and misuse our payments services to commit fraud by, among other things, creating fictitious PayPal accounts using stolen or synthetic identities or personal information, making transactions with stolen financial instruments, abusing or misusing our services for financial gain, or fraudulently inducing users of our systems into engaging in fraudulent transactions. Due to the nature of PayPal’s digital payments services, third parties may seek to engage in abusive schemes or fraud attacks that are often difficult to detect and may be deployed at a scale that would otherwise not be possible in physical transactions. Measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud and abusive behavior are complex, require continuous improvement, and may not be effective in detecting and preventing fraud, particularly new and continually evolving forms of fraud or in connection with new or expanded product offerings. If these measures are not effective, our business could be negatively impacted. We also incur substantial losses from erroneous transactions and situations where funding instruments used for legitimate transactions are closed or have insufficient funds to satisfy payments, or the payment is initiated to an unintended recipient in error. Numerous and evolving fraud schemes and misuse of our payments services could subject us to significant costs and liabilities, require us to change our business practices, cause us to incur significant remediation costs, lead to loss of customer confidence in, or decreased use of, our products and services, damage our reputation and brands, divert the attention of management from the operation of our business, and result in significant compensation or contractual penalties from us to our customers and their business partners as a result of losses or claims.Our Purchase and Seller Protection Programs (“protection programs”) are intended to reduce the likelihood of losses for consumers and merchants from unauthorized and fraudulent transactions. The Purchase Protection Program also protects consumers who do not receive the item ordered or who receive an item that is significantly different from its description. We incur substantial losses from our protection programs as a result of disputes filed by our customers. We seek to recover losses from our protection programs from the merchant, but may not be able to fully recover our losses (for example, if the merchant is unwilling or unable to pay, the transaction involves a fraudulent merchant, or the merchant provides sufficient evidence that the item was delivered). In addition, consumers who pay through PayPal or Venmo may have reimbursement rights from their payment card issuer, which in turn will seek recovery from us. If losses incurred by us related to payment card transactions become excessive, we could lose the ability to accept payment cards for payment, which would negatively impact our business. Regulators and card networks may also adapt error resolution and chargeback requirements to account for evolving forms of fraud, which could increase PayPal’s exposure to fraud losses and impact the scope of coverage of our protection programs. Increases in our loss rate, including as a result of changes to the scope of transactions covered by our protection programs, could negatively impact our business. See “Note 13—Commitments and Contingencies—Protection Programs” to our consolidated financial statements.Failure to effectively monitor and evaluate the financial condition of our merchants may expose PayPal to losses. In the event of the bankruptcy, insolvency, business failure, or other business interruption of a merchant that sells goods or services in advance of the date of their delivery or use (e.g., airline, cruise, or concert tickets, custom-made goods, and subscriptions), we could be liable to the buyers of such goods or services, including through our Purchase Protection Program or through chargebacks on 26 payment cards used by customers to fund their purchase. Allowances for transaction losses that we have established may be insufficient to cover incurred losses. Use of our payments services for illegal activities or improper purposes could harm our business. We expect that users will continue to attempt to use our payments platform for illegal activities or improper uses, including money laundering, terrorist financing, sanctions evasion, illegal online gambling, fraudulent sales of goods or services, illegal telemarketing activities, illegal sales of prescription medications or controlled substances, piracy of software, movies, music, and other copyrighted, trademarked or digital goods, bank fraud, child pornography, human trafficking, prohibited sales of alcoholic beverages or tobacco products, securities fraud, pyramid or Ponzi schemes, or the facilitation of other illegal or improper activity. Moreover, certain activity that may be legal in one jurisdiction may be illegal in another jurisdiction, and a merchant may be found responsible for intentionally or inadvertently importing or exporting illegal goods, resulting in liability for us. Owners of intellectual property rights or government authorities may seek to bring legal action against providers of payments solutions, including PayPal, that are peripherally involved in the sale of infringing or allegedly infringing items by a user. While we invest in measures intended to prevent and detect illegal activities that may occur on our payments platform, these measures require continuous improvement and may not be effective in detecting and preventing illegal activity or improper uses.Any illegal or improper uses of our payments platform or failure by us to detect or prevent illegal or improper activity by our users may subject us to claims, individual and class action lawsuits, and government and regulatory requests, inquiries, or investigations that could result in liability, restrict our operations, impose additional restrictions or limitations on our business or require us to change our business practices, harm our reputation, increase our costs, and negatively impact our business. Acquisitions, strategic investments, and other strategic transactions could result in operating difficulties and could harm our business. We expect to continue to consider and evaluate a wide array of potential strategic transactions as part of our overall business strategy, including business combinations, acquisitions, and dispositions of certain businesses, technologies, services, products, and other assets; strategic investments; and commercial and strategic partnerships (collectively, “strategic transactions”). At any given time, we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more strategic transactions, any of which could, individually or in the aggregate, be material to our financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying, negotiating, consummating and integrating favorable transaction opportunities. Strategic transactions may involve additional significant challenges, uncertainties, and risks, including challenges of integrating new employees, products, systems, technologies, operations, and business cultures; challenges associated with operating acquired businesses in markets or business areas in which we may have limited or no experience; disruption of our ongoing operations and diversion of our management’s attention; inadequate data security, cybersecurity, or operational and information technology resilience; failure to identify, or our underestimation of, commitments, liabilities, deficiencies and other risks associated with acquired businesses or assets; potential exposure to new or incremental risks associated with acquired businesses and entities, strategic investments and other strategic transactions, including potential new or increased regulatory oversight and uncertain or evolving legal, regulatory, and compliance requirements, particularly with respect to companies in new or developing businesses or industries; failure of the transaction to advance our business strategy or for its anticipated benefits to materialize; potential impairment of goodwill or other acquisition-related intangible assets; and the potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities or the incurrence of significant additional debt. Strategic transactions are inherently risky, may not be successful, and may harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Strategic investments in which we have a minority ownership stake inherently involve a lesser degree of influence over business operations. The success of our strategic investments may be dependent on controlling shareholders, management, or other persons or entities that may have business interests, strategies, or goals that are inconsistent with ours. Business decisions or other actions or omissions of the controlling shareholders, management, or other persons or entities who control companies in which we invest may adversely affect the value of our investment, result in litigation or regulatory action against us, and damage our reputation. Our international operations subject us to increased risks, which could harm our business. Our international operations generate roughly one-half of our net revenues. Our international operations subject us to significant challenges, uncertainties, and risks, including local regulatory, licensing, reporting, and legal obligations; costs and challenges associated with operating in markets in which we may have limited or no experience, including effectively localizing our products and services and adapting them to local preferences; difficulties in developing, staffing, and simultaneously managing 27 a large number of varying foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences and in light of varying laws, regulations, and customs; differing employment practices and the existence of works councils; difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified employees and maintaining our company culture; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; exchange control regulations; profit repatriation restrictions; potential tariffs, sanctions, fines, or other trade barriers or restrictions; import or export regulations; compliance with U.S. and foreign anti-bribery, anti-corruption, sanctions, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws and regulations; the interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions; and national or regional political, economic, or social instability.Our international operations also may heighten many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section. Any violations of the complex foreign and U.S. laws, rules and regulations that may apply to our international operations may result in lawsuits, enforcement actions, criminal actions, or sanctions against us and, our directors, officers, and employees; prohibit or require us to change our business practices; and damage our reputation. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies. These risks are inherent in our international operations, may increase our costs of doing business internationally, and could materially and adversely affect our business. Global and regional economic conditions could harm our business. Adverse global and regional economic conditions such as turmoil affecting the banking system or financial markets, including, but not limited to, tightening in the credit markets, extreme volatility or distress in the financial markets (including the fixed income, credit, currency, equity, and commodity markets), higher unemployment, high consumer debt levels, recessionary or inflationary pressures, supply chain issues, reduced consumer confidence or economic activity, government fiscal and tax policies, U.S. and international trade relationships, agreements, treaties, tariffs and restrictive actions, the inability of a government to enact a budget in a fiscal year, government shutdowns, government austerity programs, and other negative financial news or macroeconomic developments could have a material adverse impact on the demand for our products and services, including a reduction in the volume and size of transactions on our payments platform. Additionally, any inability to access the capital markets when needed due to volatility or illiquidity in the markets or increased regulatory liquidity and capital requirements may strain our liquidity position. Such conditions may also expose us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates that could materially and adversely affect our financial results. If our reputation or our brands are damaged, our business and operating results may be harmed. Our reputation and brands are globally recognized, important to our business, and affect our ability to attract and retain our customers. There are numerous ways our reputation or brands could be damaged. We may experience scrutiny or backlash from customers, partners, employees, government entities, media, advocacy groups, and other influencers or stakeholders that disagree with, among other things, our product offering decisions or public policy positions. Damage to our reputation or our brands may result from, among other things, new features, products, services, operational efforts, or terms of service (or changes to the same), or our decisions regarding user privacy, data practices, or information security. The proliferation of social media may increase and compound the likelihood, speed, magnitude, and unpredictability of negative brand events. If our brands or reputation are damaged, our business and operating results may be adversely impacted. Brexit: The U.K.’s departure from the EU could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Following the departure of the U.K. from the EU and the EEA on January 31, 2020 (commonly referred to as “Brexit”) and the expiration of the transition period on December 31, 2020, there continues to be uncertainty over the practical consequences of Brexit, including the potential for greater restrictions on the supply and availability of goods and services between the U.K. and EEA region, and a general deterioration in consumer sentiment and credit conditions leading to overall negative economic growth and increased risk of merchant default. The consequences of Brexit have brought legal uncertainty and increased complexity for financial services firms, which could continue as national laws and regulations in the U.K. differ from EU laws and regulations and additional authorization requirements come into effect. These developments have led and could lead in the future to additional regulatory costs and challenges for us. Specifically, PayPal (Europe) currently operates in the U.K. within the scope of its passport permissions (as they existed at the end of the transition period) pursuant to the Temporary Permissions Regime pending the grant of new authorizations by the U.K. financial regulators. If we are unable to obtain the required authorizations before the expiry of the longstop dates set by the U.K. regulators under the Temporary Permissions Regime, our European operations could lose their ability to offer services within the U.K. market, or into the U.K. market on a cross-border basis. Our European operations may 28 also be required to comply with legal and regulatory requirements in the U.K. that may be in addition to, or inconsistent with, those of the EEA, in each case, leading to increased complexity and costs. Real or perceived inaccuracies in our key metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business. Our key metrics are calculated using internal company data based on the activity we measure on our payments platform and compiled from multiple systems, including systems that are internally developed or acquired through business combinations. While the measurement of our key metrics is based on what we believe to be reasonable methodologies and estimates, there are inherent challenges and limitations in measuring our key metrics globally at scale. The methodologies used to calculate our key metrics require judgment. We regularly review our processes for calculating these key metrics, and from time to time we may make adjustments to improve the accuracy or relevance of our metrics. For example, we continuously apply models, processes and practices designed to detect and prevent fraudulent account creation on our platforms, and work to improve and enhance those capabilities. When we detect a significant volume of illegitimate activity, we generally remove the activity identified from our key metrics. Although such adjustments may impact key metrics reported in prior periods, we generally do not update previously reported key metrics to reflect these subsequent adjustments unless the retrospective impact of process improvements or enhancements is determined by management to be material. Further, as our business develops, we may revise or cease reporting metrics if we determine that such metrics are no longer appropriate measures of our performance. If investors, analysts, or customers do not consider our reported measures to be sufficient or to accurately reflect our business, we may receive negative publicity, our reputation may be harmed, and our business may be adversely impacted. Environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) issues may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and damage our reputation. Customers, investors, employees and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on ESG practices, including with respect to global talent, cybersecurity, data privacy and protection and climate change. If we do not adapt to and comply with new laws and regulations or changes to legal or regulatory requirements concerning ESG matters, or fail to meet rapidly evolving investor, industry or stakeholder expectations and standards, our reputation may be harmed, customers may choose to refrain from using our products and services, and our business or financial condition may be adversely affected. Further, we may experience additional scrutiny or backlash from customers, partners, media, government entities, and other stakeholders that disagree if they perceive PayPal to not have responded appropriately with respect to ESG matters.We specifically recognize the inherent physical climate-related risks wherever business is conducted. Our primary locations may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. For example, California, where our headquarters are located, has historically experienced, and is projected to continue to experience, climate-related events more frequently, including drought, water scarcity, flooding, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality impacts, and power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention. These extreme weather conditions may disrupt our business and may cause us to experience additional costs to maintain or resume operations and higher attrition. In addition, current and emerging legal and regulatory requirements with respect to climate change (e.g., carbon pricing) and other aspects of ESG (e.g., disclosure requirements) may result in increased compliance requirements on our business and supply chain, which may increase our operating costs and cause disruptions in our operations. If one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their financial or performance obligations to us or fail, we may incur significant losses. We have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents, receivables outstanding, and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the U.S. and international jurisdictions. As part of our foreign currency hedging activities, we regularly enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments with various financial institutions. Certain banks and other financial institutions are also lenders under our credit facilities. We regularly monitor our exposure to counterparty credit risk, and actively manage this exposure to mitigate the associated risk. Despite these efforts, we may be exposed to the risk of default on obligations by, or deteriorating operating results or financial condition or failure of, these counterparty financial institutions. If one of our counterparty financial institutions were to become insolvent, placed into receivership, or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or to access or recover our assets that are deposited, held in accounts with, or otherwise due from, such counterparty may be limited due to the insufficiency of the failed institutions’ estate to satisfy all claims in full or the applicable laws or regulations governing the insolvency, bankruptcy, or resolution proceedings. In the event of default on obligations by, or the failure of, one or more of these counterparties, we could incur significant losses, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. 29 There are risks associated with our indebtedness. We have incurred indebtedness, and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations and generate sufficient cash flows to service such debt. Our outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness we incur may have significant consequences, including the need to use a significant portion of our cash flow from operations and other available cash to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes, including capital expenditures, acquisitions, strategic investments, and share repurchases; the reduction of our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business, competitive pressures and market conditions; and limits on our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, strategic investments, share repurchases, or other general corporate purposes.Our revolving credit facilities and the indentures for our senior unsecured notes pursuant to which certain of our outstanding debt securities were issued contain financial and other covenants that restrict or could restrict, among other things, our business and operations. If we fail to pay amounts due under a debt instrument or breach any of its covenants, the lenders or noteholders would typically have the right to demand immediate repayment of all borrowings thereunder (subject in certain cases to a grace or cure period). Moreover, any such acceleration and required repayment of, or default in respect of, our indebtedness could, in turn, constitute an event of default under other debt instruments, thereby resulting in the acceleration and required repayment of our indebtedness. Any of these events could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.Changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity securities and increase our borrowing costs. If our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, the interest rates payable by us under our indebtedness may increase, and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected. Changes in tax laws, exposure to unanticipated additional tax liabilities, or implementation of reporting or record-keeping obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business. An increasing number of U.S. states, the U.S. federal government, and governments of foreign jurisdictions, such as the EU Commission, as well as international organizations, such as the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, are focused on tax reform and other legislative or regulatory action to increase tax revenue. For example, various countries have proposed or enacted digital services taxes. These actions may materially affect our effective tax rate.The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation and significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are currently undergoing a number of investigations, audits, and reviews by tax authorities in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could result in unforeseen tax-related liabilities that differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements, which may, individually or in the aggregate, materially affect our financial results in the periods for which such determination is made. While we have established reserves based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventualities, these reserves may prove to be insufficient.In addition, our future income taxes could be adversely affected by the incurrence of losses or earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates, and earnings being higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, including as a result of gains on our foreign currency exchange risk management program; by changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles; or by certain discrete items.A number of U.S. states, the U.S. federal government, and foreign jurisdictions have implemented and may impose reporting or record-keeping obligations on companies that engage in or facilitate e-commerce to improve tax compliance. A number of jurisdictions are also reviewing whether payment service providers and other intermediaries could be deemed to be the legal agent of merchants for certain tax purposes. We have modified our systems to meet applicable requirements and expect that further modifications will be required to comply with future requirements, which may negatively impact our customer experience and increase operational costs. Any failure by us to comply with these and similar reporting and record-keeping obligations could result in substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions, adversely impact our ability to do business in certain jurisdictions, and harm our business. 30 We may be unable to attract, retain, and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our business. Competition for key and other highly skilled personnel is intense, especially for executive talent, software engineers, and other technology talent. We may be limited in our ability to recruit or hire internationally, including due to restrictive laws or policies on immigration, travel, or availability of visas for skilled workers. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel, or our inability to attract, hire, develop, motivate and retain key and other highly qualified and diverse talent, whether in a remote or in-office environment, or protect the safety, health and productivity of our workforce could harm our overall business and results of operations. We are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our products and services. We may be subject to claims relating to information disseminated through our online services, including claims alleging defamation, libel, harassment, hate speech, breach of contract, invasion of privacy, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through the services, among other things. We invest in measures intended to detect and block activities that may occur on our payments platform in violation of our policies and applicable laws. These measures require continuous improvement and may not be sufficiently effective in detecting and preventing the exchange of information in violation of our policies and applicable laws. If these measures are not sufficiently effective, our business could be negatively impacted. If the laws or regulations that provide protections for online dissemination of information are invalidated or are modified to reduce protections available to us and we become liable for information provided by our customers and carried on our products and services, we could be directly harmed and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure, including expending substantial resources or discontinuing certain product or service offerings, which could harm our business. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, in addition to other information appearing in this Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, for important information regarding risks and uncertainties that could affect us.

        "question": "PayPal utilizes increasing active account engagement as a critical element of its growth strategy. Based on the Company's stated revenue model, what specific financial mechanism ensures that the anticipated growth in payment transactions and Total Payment Volume directly results in the primary component of net revenues?",
        "answer": "The mechanism is the fee structure based on volume: PayPal primarily earns revenues by charging fees for completing payment transactions, and these charges are typically based directly on the volume of activity (TPV and transactions) processed on its payments platform. Therefore, growth in volume driven by engagement directly scales the primary revenue stream."

    "context": "OVERVIEW PayPal Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in January 2015 and is a leading technology platform that enables digital payments and simplifies commerce experiences on behalf of merchants and consumers worldwide. PayPal is committed to democratizing financial services to help improve the financial health of individuals and to increase economic opportunity for entrepreneurs and businesses of all sizes around the world. Our goal is to enable our merchants and consumers to manage and move their money anywhere in the world in the markets we serve, anytime, on any platform, and using any device when sending payments or getting paid. We believe that effective management of environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) risks and opportunities is essential to deliver on our mission and strategy. Our core values of Collaboration, Inclusion, Innovation, and Wellness are the driving forces behind our mission and form the foundation of our operating philosophy. We believe that they help stimulate the creativity and engagement of our global workforce to deliver products and services designed to meet the diverse needs of our customers. Unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires, references to “we,” “our,” “us,” “the Company,” or “PayPal” refer to PayPal Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. 4 PayPal’s payment solutions enable our customers to send and receive payments. We operate a global, two-sided network at scale that connects merchants and consumers with 426 million active accounts (consisting of 392 million consumer active accounts and 34 million merchant active accounts) across more than 200 markets. PayPal helps merchants and consumers connect, transact, and complete payments, whether they are online or in person. PayPal is more than a connection to third-party payment networks. We provide proprietary payment solutions accepted by merchants that enable the completion of payments on our payments platform on behalf of our customers. We offer our customers the flexibility to use their accounts to purchase and receive payments for goods and services, as well as the ability to transfer and withdraw funds. We enable consumers to exchange funds more safely with merchants using a variety of funding sources, which may include a bank account, a PayPal or Venmo account balance, PayPal and Venmo branded credit products, a credit card, a debit card, certain cryptocurrencies, or other stored value products such as gift cards, and eligible credit card rewards. Our PayPal, Venmo, and Xoom products also make it safer and simpler for friends and family to transfer funds to each other. We offer merchants an end-to-end payments solution that provides authorization and settlement capabilities, as well as instant access to funds and payouts. We also help merchants connect with their customers, process exchanges and returns, and manage risk. We enable consumers to engage in cross-border shopping and merchants to extend their global reach while reducing the complexity and friction involved in enabling cross-border trade. We earn revenues primarily by charging fees for completing payment transactions for our customers and other payment-related services that are typically based on the volume of activity processed on our payments platform. We generally do not charge customers to fund or draw from their accounts; however, we generate revenue from customers on fees charged for foreign currency conversion, instant transfers from their PayPal or Venmo account to their debit card or bank account, and to facilitate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies. We also earn revenue by providing other value added services, which comprises revenue earned through partnerships, interest and fees from our merchant and consumer credit products, referral fees, subscription fees, gateway services, and other services that we provide to our merchants and consumers. 5 KEY PERFORMANCE METRICS We measure the relevance of our products and services to our customers and the performance and success of our business through active accounts, payment transactions, and total payment volume:An active account is an account registered directly with PayPal or a platform access partner that has completed a transaction on our platform, not including gateway-exclusive transactions, within the past 12 months. A platform access partner is a third party whose customers are provided access to PayPal’s platform or services through such third-party’s login credentials, including entities that utilize Hyperwallet’s payout capabilities. A user may register on our platform to access different products and may register more than one account to access a product. Accordingly, a user may have more than one active account.Number of payment transactions are the total number of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions.Total payment volume (“TPV”) is the value of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions. OUR STRENGTHS Our business is built on a strong foundation designed to drive growth and differentiate us from our competitors. We believe that our competitive strengths include the following:•Two-sided network—our payments platform connecting merchants and consumers enables PayPal to offer unique end-to-end product experiences while gaining valuable insights into how customers use our platform. Our payments platform provides for digital and in-store (at the point of sale) transactions while being both technology and platform agnostic.•Scale—our global scale helps us to drive organic growth. As of December 31, 2021, we had 426 million active accounts, consisting of 392 million consumer active accounts and 34 million merchant active accounts in more than 200 markets around the world. A market is a geographic area or political jurisdiction, such as a country, territory, or protectorate, in which we offer some or all of our products and services. A country, territory, or protectorate is identified by a distinct set of laws and regulations. In 2021, we processed $1.25 trillion of TPV. 6 •Trusted brands—we have built and strengthened well-recognized and trusted brands, including PayPal, Braintree, Venmo, Xoom, Zettle, and Honey. Our communications and marketing efforts across multiple geographies and demographic groups play an important role in building brand visibility, usage, and overall preference among customers. •Risk and compliance management—our enterprise risk and compliance management program and use of tokenization are designed to help secure customer information, and to help ensure we process legitimate transactions around the world, while identifying and minimizing illegal, high-risk, or fraudulent transactions.•Regulatory licenses—we believe that our regulatory licenses, which enable us to operate in markets around the world, are a distinct advantage and help support business growth. MERCHANT AND CONSUMER PAYMENT SOLUTIONS Merchant value proposition We partner with our merchants to help grow and expand their businesses by providing global reach and powering all aspects of digital checkout. We offer alternative payment methods, including access to credit solutions, provide fraud prevention and risk management solutions, reduce losses through proprietary protection programs, and offer tools and insights for utilizing data analytics to attract new customers and improve sales conversion. We employ a technology and platform agnostic approach intended to enable merchants of all sizes to quickly and easily provide digital checkout online and in-store across all platforms and devices and to securely and simply receive payments from their customers. PayPal’s payments platform enables merchants to accept all types of online and offline payments, including those made with the PayPal and Venmo digital wallets, our consumer credit products, credit cards and debit cards, and other competitor digital wallets, as well as other popular local payment methods. Our diversified suite of products and services is tailored to meet the needs of merchants regardless of their size or business complexity. We have expanded our merchant value proposition to enable payment acceptance at the point of sale through our PayPal and Venmo digital wallets, quick response (“QR”) code-based solutions, and our Zettle point of sale solutions. We aim to offer a seamless, omni-channel solution that helps merchants manage and grow their business. Through our consumer focused offerings, we provide simplified and personalized shopping experiences for consumers, including the ability to easily make exchanges and returns, to help merchants drive increased conversion through higher consumer engagement. 7 We offer access to merchant finance products for certain small and medium-sized businesses through the PayPal Working Capital and PayPal Business Loan products, which we collectively refer to as our merchant finance offerings. The PayPal Working Capital product allows businesses to access a loan or cash advance for a fixed fee and based on their annual payment volume processed by PayPal. The PayPal Business Loan product provides businesses with short-term financing for a fixed fee based on an evaluation of both the applying business as well as the business owner. In the United States (“U.S.”), these products are provided under a program agreement with WebBank. We believe that these merchant finance offerings enable us to deepen our engagement with our existing small and medium-sized merchants and expand services to new merchants by providing access to capital that may not be available effectively or efficiently from traditional banks or other lending providers. Our acquisition of Paidy, Inc. (“Paidy”) enables us to expand our buy now, pay later solutions and other capabilities in Japan. Our acquisition of Guofubao Information Technology Co. (GoPay), Ltd., a holder of payment business licenses in China, enables us to partner with Chinese financial institutions and technology platforms to provide a more comprehensive set of payment solutions to merchants and consumers, both in China and globally.We generate revenues from merchants primarily by charging fees for completing their payment transactions and other payment-related services. We also earn revenues from interest and fees earned on our merchant loans receivables. Consumer value proposition We focus on providing affordable, convenient, and secure consumer financial products and services intended to democratize the management and movement of money. We provide consumers with a digital wallet that enables them to send payments to merchants more safely using a variety of funding sources, which may include a bank account, a PayPal account balance, a Venmo account balance, our consumer credit products, credit cards, debit cards, certain cryptocurrencies, or other stored value products such as gift cards, and eligible credit card rewards. We also offer consumers person-to-person (“P2P”) payment solutions through our PayPal, Venmo, and Xoom products and services. We enable both domestic and international P2P transfers across our payments platform. Our Venmo digital wallet in the U.S. is a leading mobile application used to move money between our customers and to make purchases at select merchants. Xoom is an international money transfer service that enables our customers to send money and prepaid mobile phone reloads to, and pay bills for, people around the world in a secure, fast, and cost-effective way. P2P is a significant customer acquisition channel that facilitates organic growth by enabling potential PayPal users to establish active accounts with us at the time they make or receive a P2P payment. We also simplify and personalize shopping experiences for our consumers by offering tools for product discovery, price-tracking, offers, and easier exchanges and returns, which enhances consumer engagement and sales conversion for our merchants.We offer credit products to consumers in certain markets as a potential funding source at checkout. Once a consumer is approved for credit, the product is made available as a funding source for that account holder. The U.S. PayPal- and Venmo-branded consumer credit program is offered through Synchrony Bank. We offer a PayPal-issued PayPal Credit product in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) and a PayPal branded consumer credit card issued by Citigroup in Australia. In addition, we have expanded our consumer credit offerings to include buy now, pay later installment products in the U.S., U.K., France, Germany, Australia, Spain, Italy, and through the acquisition of Paidy, in Japan. A key attribute of our buy now, pay later products is the absence of consumer late fees for missed payments in most of the geographies where we offer it. We believe that our consumer credit products help enable us to increase engagement with consumers and merchants on our two-sided network. We have expanded our consumer value proposition through enhancements to the PayPal and Venmo digital wallets, which provide increased functionality for consumers to explore deals and offers and to more easily transact with cryptocurrencies in certain markets. Our goal is to drive increased consumer engagement by providing consumers with a comprehensive set of services to manage their finances and enhancing their ability to shop online and in person.We generate revenue from consumers on fees charged for foreign currency conversion, instant transfers from their PayPal or Venmo account to their debit card or bank account, to facilitate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies, interest, fees, or other revenue from credit product programs, and other miscellaneous fees. 8 PROTECTING MERCHANTS AND CONSUMERS Protecting merchants and consumers on our payments platform from financial and fraud loss is imperative to successfully competing and sustainably growing our business. Fraudulent activities, such as account takeover, identity theft (including stolen financial information), and counterparty malicious activities, represent a significant risk to merchants and consumers, as well as their payment partners. We provide merchants and consumers with protection programs for certain purchase transactions completed on our payments platform. We believe that these programs, which help protect both merchants and consumers from financial loss resulting from fraud and counterparty non-performance, are generally consistent with or broader than protections provided by other participants in the payments industry. These programs are designed to promote confidence on both the part of consumers, who will only be required to pay if they receive their purchased item in the condition significantly as described, and merchants, who will receive payment for the product they deliver to the customer.Our ability to protect both merchants and consumers is based largely on our proprietary, end-to-end payments platform and our ability to utilize the data from both sides of transactions on our two-sided network, specifically from buyers and sellers and from senders and receivers of payments. Our ongoing investment in systems and processes designed to enhance the safety and security of our products reflects our goal of having PayPal recognized as one of the world’s most trusted payments brands. COMPETITION The global payments industry is highly competitive, continuously changing, highly innovative, and increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny and oversight. Many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with innovative and disruptive technologies, shifting user preferences and needs, price sensitivity of merchants and consumers, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Competition also may intensify as new competitors emerge, businesses enter into business combinations and partnerships, and established companies in other segments expand to become competitive with various aspects of our business.We compete with a wide range of businesses. Some of our current and potential competitors are or may be larger than we are, have larger customer bases, greater brand recognition, longer operating histories, a dominant or more secure position, broader geographic scope, volume, scale, resources, and market share than we do, or offer products and services that we do not offer. Other competitors are or may be smaller or younger companies that may be more agile in responding quickly to regulatory and technological changes. We differentiate ourselves to merchants through our ability to innovate and develop products and services that offer new payment experiences for our merchants, demonstrate that they may achieve incremental sales by using and offering our services to consumers, support transactions on our payments platform across varied technologies and payment methods, through the simplicity and transparency of our fee structure, and our seller protection programs. In addition, we differentiate ourselves to consumers through the ability to use our products and services across multiple commerce channels, including e-commerce, mobile, and payments at the point of sale, and without sharing their financial information with the merchant or any other party they are paying; our customer service, dispute resolution, and buyer protection programs; and our ability to simplify and personalize shopping experiences. We invest resources towards improving our products and services, offering choice in payment options, providing excellent customer service, and building brands that merchants and consumers trust.Our business faces competition from a wide range of businesses and from all forms of physical and electronic payments. We face competition from banks and financial institutions, which provide traditional payment methods (particularly credit cards and debit cards (collectively, “payment cards”), electronic bank transfers, and credit), payment networks that facilitate payments for payment cards or proprietary retail networks, payment card processors, and “card on file” services. We also face competition from providers offering a variety of payment products and services including tokenized and contactless payment cards, digital wallets and mobile payments solutions, credit, installment or other buy now pay later methods, real-time payment systems, P2P payments and money remittance services, card readers and other devices or technologies for payment at point of sale, virtual currencies and distributed ledger technologies, and tools that simplify and personalize shopping experiences for consumers and merchants. Our products and services face competition from all forms of payments, which include paper-based payments (primarily cash and checks), credit cards, debit cards, electronic bank transfers, credit, installment methods, digital wallets and mobile payment solutions, contactless payments (including contactless cards, tokenized cards, Near Field Communication based solutions, and QR code-based solutions), and virtual currencies, such as cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. In addition to the discussion in this section, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” under the caption “We face substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry” for further discussion of the potential impact of competition on our business. 9 STRATEGY Our ability to grow revenue is affected by, among other things, consumer spending patterns, merchant and consumer adoption of digital payment methods, the expansion of multiple commerce channels, the growth of mobile devices and merchant and consumer applications on those devices, the growth of consumers globally with internet and mobile access, the pace of transition from cash and checks to digital forms of payment, our share of the digital payments market, and our ability to innovate and introduce new products and services that merchants and consumers value. Our strategy to drive growth in our business includes the following:•Growing our core business: through expanding our global capabilities, customer base and scale, increasing our customers’ use of our products and services by better addressing their everyday needs related to accessing, managing, and moving money, creating seamless checkout experiences, and expanding the adoption of our solutions by merchants and consumers;•Expanding our value proposition for merchants and consumers: by being technology and platform agnostic, partnering with our merchants to grow and expand their business online and in-store, and providing consumers with simple, secure, and flexible ways to manage and move money across different markets, merchants, and platforms and simplifying their shopping experiences; •Forming strategic partnerships: by building new strategic partnerships to provide better experiences for our customers, offer greater choice and flexibility, acquire new customers, and reinforce our role in the payments ecosystem; and•Seeking new areas of growth: organically and through acquisitions and strategic investments in our existing and new international markets around the world and focusing on innovation in both the digital and physical world. ESG MANAGEMENT PayPal is committed to creating a more inclusive global economy and advancing our core values of Collaboration, Inclusion, Innovation, and Wellness across our communities, workforce, and strategies. We manage priority ESG risks and opportunities through four key pillars: (1) social innovation, (2) employees and culture, (3) environmental sustainability, and (4) responsible business practices. We believe this integrated, enterprise-wide approach to managing our global business responsibly helps to enable us to create value for all of our stakeholders, including our employees, stockholders, partners, and communities. In 2021, we continued to advance our ESG strategy, including through the following: a science-based approach to reducing our climate change impacts, targeted investments to address the racial wealth gap and empower underserved communities and businesses, programmatic development intended to foster an inclusive culture across the employee lifecycle, and ongoing enhancements to support the safety and security of our products and platform. We take this commitment seriously and endeavor to provide transparent disclosures on the progress of this work through our annual Global Impact Report and other communications. TECHNOLOGY Our payments platform utilizes a combination of proprietary and third-party technologies and services intended to facilitate transactions efficiently and securely between millions of merchants and consumers worldwide across different channels, markets, and networks. Our payments platform connects with financial service providers around the world and allows consumers to make purchases using a wide range of payment methods, regardless of where a merchant is located. Consumers who use our payments platform can send payments in more than 200 markets around the world and in more than 100 currencies, withdraw funds to their bank accounts in 56 currencies, and hold balances in their PayPal accounts in 25 currencies. A transaction on our payments platform can involve multiple participants in addition to us, including a merchant, a consumer, and the consumer’s funding source provider. We have developed intuitive user interfaces, customer tools, transaction completion databases, and network applications on our payments platform designed to enable our customers to utilize our suite of products and services. Our payments platform, open application programming interfaces, and developer tools are designed to enable developers to innovate with ease and offer robust applications to our global ecosystem of merchants and consumers, while at the same time maintaining the security of our customers’ information. 10 The technology infrastructure supporting our payments platform simplifies the storage and processing of large amounts of data and facilitates the deployment and operation of large-scale global products and services in both our own data centers and when hosted by third party cloud service providers. Our technology infrastructure is designed around industry best practices intended to reduce downtime and help ensure the resiliency of our payments platform in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences. Our payments platform incorporates multiple layers of protection for business continuity and system redundancy purposes and to help mitigate cybersecurity risks. We have a comprehensive cybersecurity program designed to protect our technology infrastructure and payments platform against cybersecurity threats, which includes regularly testing our systems to identify and address potential vulnerabilities. We strive to continually improve our technology infrastructure and payments platform to enhance the customer experience and to increase efficiency, scalability, and security. For additional information regarding risks relating to our technology infrastructure and cybersecurity, see the information in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” under the captions “Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to our reputation, business, and financial condition” and “Business interruptions or systems failures may impair the availability of our websites, applications, products or services, or otherwise harm our business.” RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Our total research and development expense was $1.6 billion, $1.4 billion, and $1.1 billion in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY The protection of our intellectual property, including our trademarks, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, patents, and trade secrets, is important to the success of our business. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on applicable laws, regulations, and administrative procedures in the U.S. and internationally. We have registered our core brands as domain names and as trademarks in the U.S. and many international jurisdictions. We also have an active program to continue to secure and enforce trademarks and domain names that correspond to our brands in markets of interest. We have filed and continue to file patent applications in the U.S. and in international jurisdictions covering certain aspects of our proprietary technology and new innovations. We also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights when offering or procuring products and services. We have routinely entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and non-disclosure agreements with parties with whom we conduct business to control access to, and use and disclosure of, our proprietary information.For additional information regarding risks relating to our intellectual property, see the information in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” under the captions “Third parties may allege that we are infringing their patents and other intellectual property rights” and “We may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights.” GOVERNMENT REGULATION We operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened focus by regulators globally on all aspects of the payments industry, including countering terrorist financing, anti-money laundering, privacy, cybersecurity, and consumer protection. The laws and regulations applicable to us, including those enacted prior to the advent of digital payments, are continuing to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation. New or changing laws and regulations, including changes to their interpretation or implementation, as well as increased penalties and enforcement actions related to non-compliance, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We monitor these areas closely and are focused on designing compliant solutions for our customers.Government regulation impacts key aspects of our business. We are subject to regulations that affect the payments industry in the markets we operate. 11 Payments regulation. Various laws and regulations govern the payments industry in the U.S. and internationally. In the U.S., PayPal, Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary) holds licenses to operate as a money transmitter (or its equivalent) in the states where such licenses are required, as well as in the District of Columbia and certain territories. These licenses include not only the PayPal branded products and services offered in these locations, but also our Venmo, Hyperwallet, and Xoom products and services to the extent offered in these locations. As a licensed money transmitter, PayPal is subject to, among other requirements, restrictions with respect to the investment of customer funds, reporting requirements, bonding requirements, and inspection by state regulatory agencies. In certain cases, these licenses also generally cover PayPal’s service enabling customers to buy, hold, and sell cryptocurrency directly from their PayPal or Venmo account. In the State of New York, PayPal has obtained a conditional virtual currency license from the New York Department of Financial Services to offer cryptocurrency services in the state in partnership with Paxos Trust Company. Outside the U.S., we provide similar services customized for various countries and foreign jurisdictions through our foreign subsidiaries. The activities of those non-U.S. entities are, or may be, supervised by a financial regulatory authority in the jurisdictions in which they operate. Among other regulatory authorities, the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (the “CSSF”), the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, the People’s Bank of China, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Reserve Bank of India, the Central Bank of Russia, and the Central Bank of Brazil have asserted jurisdiction over some or all of our activities in their respective jurisdictions. This list is not exhaustive, and there are numerous other regulatory agencies that have or may assert jurisdiction over our activities. The laws and regulations applicable to the payments industry in any given jurisdiction are subject to interpretation and change.In addition, financial services regulators in various jurisdictions, including the U.S. and the European Union (“EU”), have implemented authentication requirements for banks and payment processors intended to reduce online fraud, which could impose significant costs, make it more difficult for new customers to join PayPal, and reduce the ease of use of our products.Banking agency supervision. We serve our customers in the EU and U.K. through PayPal (Europe) S.à.r.l. et Cie, S.C.A. (“PayPal (Europe)”), a wholly-owned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a bank in Luxembourg by the CSSF. Under the U.K.’s Temporary Permissions Regime, PayPal is also deemed to be authorized and regulated by the U.K. FCA as a result of Brexit. Consequently, we must comply with rules and regulations of the European banking industry, including those related to capitalization, funds management, corporate governance, anti-money laundering, disclosure, reporting, and inspection. We are, or may be, subject to banking-related regulations in other countries now or in the future related to our role in the financial industry. In addition, based on our relationships with our partner financial institutions, we are, or may be, subject to indirect regulation and examination by the regulators of these financial institutions.Lending regulation. PayPal’s U.S. consumer installment loan product is subject to federal and state laws governing consumer credit and debt collection. PayPal holds multiple state licenses as the lender of this product. PayPal Ratenzahlung, a regulated installment loan for consumers in Germany, is subject to applicable local laws such as consumer (lending) laws, consumer protection, or banking transparency regulations. Paidy, Inc. holds multiple licenses for the issuance of their short-term installment products in Japan and is registered with the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry as a Comprehensive Credit Purchase Intermediary. In Australia, PayPal Credit Pty Limited offers a consumer short-term installment product that is exempt from regulation by the primary consumer credit legislation but is subject to other laws which cover the provision of financial services, credit reporting, debt collection, and privacy. PayPal’s consumer buy now, pay later installment loan products in the U.K., France, Germany, Spain, and Italy are generally exempt from primary consumer credit legislation; however, certain consumer lending laws, consumer protection, or banking transparency regulations continue to apply to this activity. PayPal and Venmo co-branded consumer credit cards and the PayPal Credit consumer credit product are issued by Synchrony Bank in the U.S. and the PayPal branded consumer credit card is issued by Citigroup in Australia, and are subject to laws and regulations governing these programs. PayPal Credit in the U.K. is a regulated, revolving consumer credit product subject to applicable local laws and regulations.Our merchant finance offerings are subject to the applicable laws and regulations governing those programs, which differ by jurisdiction.Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). The CFPB has significant authority to regulate consumer financial products in the U.S., including consumer credit, deposits, payments, and similar products. As a large market participant of remittance transfers, the CFPB has direct supervisory authority over our business. The CFPB and similar regulatory agencies in other jurisdictions may have broad consumer protection mandates that could result in the promulgation and interpretation of rules and regulations that may affect our business. 12 Anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, and sanctions. PayPal is subject to anti-money laundering (“AML”) laws and regulations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, as well as laws designed to prevent the use of the financial systems to facilitate terrorist activities. Our AML program is designed to prevent our payments platform from being used to facilitate money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit activities, or to do business in countries or with persons and entities included on designated country or person lists promulgated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls and equivalent authorities in other countries. Our AML and sanctions compliance programs, overseen by our AML/Bank Secrecy Act Officer, are composed of policies, procedures, and internal controls, and are designed to address these legal and regulatory requirements and assist in managing money laundering and terrorist financing risks.Interchange fees. Interchange fees associated with four-party payments systems are being reviewed or challenged in various jurisdictions. For example, in the EU, the Multilateral Interchange Fee Regulation caps interchange fees for credit and debit card payments and provides for business rules to be complied with by any company dealing with payment card transactions, including PayPal. As a result, the fees that we collect in certain jurisdictions may become the subject of regulatory challenge.Data protection and information security. We are subject to a number of laws, rules, directives, and regulations (“privacy and data protection laws”) relating to the collection, use, retention, security, processing, and transfer (collectively, “processing”) of personally identifiable information about our customers, our merchants’ customers, and employees (“personal data”) in the countries where we operate. Our business relies on the processing of personal data in many jurisdictions and the movement of data across national borders. As a result, much of the personal data that we process, which may include certain financial information associated with individuals, is subject to one or more privacy and data protection laws in one or more jurisdictions. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between or among us, our subsidiaries, and other parties with which we have commercial relationships. The EU has adopted a comprehensive General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), which expanded the scope of the EU data protection law to foreign companies processing personal data of European Economic Area (“EEA”) individuals and imposed a stricter data protection compliance regime. In the U.S., we are subject to privacy and information safeguarding requirements under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act as well as the California Consumer Privacy Act, which requires privacy protections comparable to those afforded by the GDPR, as well as the maintenance of a written, comprehensive information security program. In Europe, the operations of our Luxembourg bank are subject to confidentiality and information safeguarding requirements under the Luxembourg Banking Act. Regulatory scrutiny of privacy, data protection, cybersecurity practices, and the processing of personal data is increasing around the world. Regulatory authorities are continuously considering numerous legislative and regulatory proposals and interpretive guidelines that may contain additional privacy and data protection obligations. In addition, the interpretation and application of these privacy and data protection laws in the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere are often uncertain and in a state of flux.Anti-corruption. PayPal is subject to applicable anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Anti-corruption laws generally prohibit offering, promising, giving, accepting, or authorizing others to provide anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to or from a government official or private party in order to influence official action or otherwise gain an unfair business advantage, such as to obtain or retain business. We have implemented policies, procedures, and internal controls that are designed to comply with these laws and regulations.Additional regulatory developments. Various regulatory agencies continue to examine and implement laws governing a wide variety of issues, including virtual currencies, identity theft, account management guidelines, disclosure rules, cybersecurity, and marketing, which may impact PayPal’s business. Certain governments around the world are adopting laws and regulations pertaining to ESG performance, transparency, and reporting, including those related to overall corporate ESG disclosures (e.g., EU Sustainable Reporting Directive) as well as topical reporting requirements, such as reporting on climate-related financial disclosures.For an additional discussion on governmental regulation affecting our business, please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” included in this Form 10-K. HUMAN CAPITAL Global talent management At PayPal, we consider the management of our global talent (human capital) to be essential to the ongoing success of our business. As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 30,900 people globally, representing approximately 150 nationalities, in approximately 30 countries, including approximately 13,100 located in the U.S. 13 Attracting, recruiting, developing, and retaining diverse talent enables us to provide our customers with products and services that help them to thrive in the global economy, and serve our other stakeholders. We are focused on supporting our employees across the full employee lifecycle from recruitment to onboarding to ongoing development, and have implemented programs designed to promote their total wellness, particularly during difficult times such as the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, in 2021, we continued to invest in employee mental wellness by providing workplace flexibility to reflect the diverse needs of our global workforce and appointing a Global Wellness Advocate. Employee engagement We use employee feedback to directly inform the ongoing development of our employee programs. In addition to administering an annual survey to gather input from our global workforce, we also conducted specific surveys to gather direct employee feedback on our annual performance program and evolving workplace preferences. For our 2021 annual employee survey, we heard from 79% of our global employees. Our engagement score, which reflects employees that would recommend PayPal to their peers and/or are happy at PayPal was 83%, which is above our technology peer benchmark. Our score measuring intent to stay was 80%, which reflects an employee’s expectation to remain employed with the company in two years. Additionally, we observed improvements in employee scores regarding effective collaboration and work life balance, two areas we focused on advancing in 2021. We also evaluate employee survey responses for feedback on other key components of our culture and programs. The detailed scores are shared across the organization and analyzed to understand differences by geography, demographics, and job level, and to identify opportunities for further improvement. For example, in 2021, we focused on enhancing our employee communications and opportunities to better support ongoing remote working. Talent acquisition, development, and retention As a leading technology platform that enables digital payments and simplifies commerce experiences, we compete for top global talent around the world. We believe that a strong culture focused on employee experiences that enables advancement, learning, and individual career insights is essential to the successful acquisition, development, and retention of diverse talent. To that end, we have implemented programs focused on inclusive hiring practices, enriched virtual new hire experiences, individual coaching and mentorship programs, and ongoing learning opportunities, including unlimited access to LinkedIn Learning. In 2021, we expanded our new employee development program with specific topical training sessions, including mobility and developing women in leadership. We also listened to employee feedback and sought opportunities to reduce employee stress and formalized the removal of individual performance ratings as part of our annual performance review process, which we believe has led to more meaningful performance conversations. Employee wellness We remain focused on promoting the holistic well-being of our employees, including resources, programs, and services to support our employees’ physical, mental, and financial wellness. In 2021, we recognized the ongoing impact the COVID-19 pandemic was having on our global employees. In response, we continued our Global Wellness Days for all employees to take time to rest and recharge, expanded our Mind Yourself program to provide trainings and workshops to foster emotional well-being, preserved flexible work arrangements through Crisis Leave and other programs, and strategically extended employee benefits to additional global markets. We also continued our investments to strengthen employee financial wellness, including expanding individual financial coaching, broadening employee access to early earned wages across the U.S. and additional global markets, and promoting the prioritization of employee financial health across the private sector through the Worker Financial Wellness Initiative. Diversity, inclusion, equity, and belonging We believe that fostering diversity, inclusion, equity, and belonging (“DIE&B”) is critical to our global talent strategy and pivotal to building a culture that embraces individual characteristics, values diversity, minimizes barriers, and enhances feelings of security and support across the workplace. We are committed to equal pay for equal work, promoting enterprise-wide inclusive learning opportunities, and partnering with leading organizations to embed DIE&B considerations into our talent strategy. Our strong commitment to DIE&B is evident at all levels of the organization from our Board of Directors to our executive leadership team to our global workforce. As of December 31, 2021, 50% of our Board and 56% of our senior leadership team identified as women and/or from a diverse ethnic group. Across our workforce, we reached 56% overall diverse workforce representation, including 44% global gender diversity and 52% U.S. ethnic diversity, as of December 31, 2021. 14 Workforce representation is only one aspect of our broader DIE&B strategy. We also empower eight employee resource groups to promote community and belonging for employees that identify as Black, Latinx/Hispanic, women, interfaith, veterans, LGBTQ+, Asian, and disabled persons and their allies. These groups drive ongoing employee engagement around the world for all employees, regardless of background, to support and champion their peers and related causes. In 2021, we continued our support for underrepresented communities and employees through activities such as enhanced strategic partnerships, a new inclusive learning journey, and new tools and resources to promote DIE&B considerations across the business. We also enhanced our executive compensation framework and annual performance evaluations to integrate DIE&B considerations as part of the individual performance portion of our 2021 annual incentive program for our senior executives.As part of our annual ESG reporting, we provide additional information on our global talent strategy, including detailed representation metrics, in our Global Impact Report available at https://about.pypl.com/values-in-action/reporting/global-impact-report/default.aspx.

RISK FACTORS You should carefully review this section in addition to the other information appearing in this Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, for important information regarding risks and uncertainties that affect us. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. CYBERSECURITY AND TECHNOLOGY RISKS Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to our reputation, business, and financial condition. The techniques used to attempt to obtain unauthorized or illegal access to systems and information (including customers’ personal data), disable or degrade service, exploit vulnerabilities, or sabotage systems are constantly evolving, and in some circumstances may not be recognized or detected until after they have been launched against a target. Unauthorized parties have attempted, and we expect that they will continue to attempt, to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means, including, but not limited to, hacking into our systems or facilities or those of our customers, partners, or vendors, and attempting to fraudulently induce users of our systems (including employees and customers) into disclosing user names, passwords, payment card information, or other sensitive information used to gain access to such systems or facilities. This information may in turn be used to access our customers’ personal or proprietary information and payment card data that are stored on or accessible through our information technology systems and those of third parties with whom we partner. Numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats, including advanced and persisting cyberattacks, cyberextortion, distributed denial-of-service attacks, ransomware, spear phishing and social engineering schemes, the introduction of computer viruses or other malware, and the physical destruction of all or portions of our information technology and infrastructure and those of third parties with whom we partner could compromise the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the data in our systems. We have experienced from time to time, and may experience in the future, breaches of our security measures due to human error, malfeasance, insider threats, system errors or vulnerabilities, or other irregularities. We believe that PayPal is a particularly attractive target for cybercriminals due to our name, brand recognition, types of data (including payments-related data) that customers provide to us, and the widespread adoption and use of our products and services. Any cyberattacks or data security breaches affecting the information technology or infrastructure of companies we acquire or of our customers, partners, or vendors (including data center and cloud computing providers) could have similar negative effects. For example, in November 2017, we suspended the operations of TIO Networks (“TIO”) (acquired in July 2017) as part of an investigation of security vulnerabilities of the TIO platform. In December 2017, we announced that we had identified evidence of unauthorized access to TIO’s network and the potential compromise of personally identifiable information for approximately 1.6 million TIO customers. This incident resulted in governmental inquiries and civil claims against us and may lead to additional inquiries and claims in the future. Under payment card network rules and our contracts with our payment processors, if there is a breach of payment card information that we store, or that is stored by our direct payment card processing vendors, we could be liable to the payment card issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses. Cybersecurity breaches and other exploited security vulnerabilities could subject us to significant costs and liabilities, result in improper disclosure of data and violations of applicable privacy and other laws, require us to change our business practices, cause us to incur significant remediation costs, lead to loss of customer confidence in, or decreased use of, our products and services, damage our reputation and brands, divert the attention of management from the operation of our business, result in significant compensation or contractual penalties from us to our customers and their business partners as a result of losses to or claims by them, or expose us to regulatory penalties and fines. While we maintain insurance policies intended to offset the financial impact we may experience from these risks, our coverage may be insufficient to compensate us for all losses caused by security breaches and other damage to or unavailability of our systems. 16 Business interruptions or systems failures may impair the availability of our websites, applications, products or services, or otherwise harm our business. Our systems and operations and those of our service providers and partners have experienced from time to time, and may experience in the future, business interruptions or degradation because of distributed denial-of-service and other cyberattacks, insider threats, hardware and software defects or malfunctions, human error, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, and other natural disasters, public health crises (including pandemics), power losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist attacks, computer viruses or other malware, or other events. The frequency and intensity of weather events related to climate change are increasing, which could increase the likelihood and severity of such disasters as well as related damage and business interruption. Our corporate headquarters are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a seismically active region in California. A catastrophic event that results in a disruption or failure of our systems or operations could result in significant losses and require substantial recovery time and significant expenditures to resume or maintain operations, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Additionally, some of our systems, including those of companies we have acquired, are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all possible outcomes or events. As a provider of payments solutions, we are subject to heightened scrutiny by regulators that may require specific business continuity, resiliency and disaster recovery plans, and rigorous testing of such plans, which may be costly and time-consuming to implement, and may divert our resources from other business priorities. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, system failures, cyberattacks, unplanned outages, and other events or conditions from time to time that have and may interrupt the availability, or reduce or adversely affect the speed or functionality, of our products and services. These events have resulted and likely will continue to result in loss of revenue. A prolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in the availability, speed, or functionality of our products and services could materially harm our business. Frequent or persistent interruptions in our services could permanently harm our relationship with our customers and partners and our reputation. Moreover, if any system failure or similar event results in damage to our customers or their business partners, they could seek significant compensation or contractual penalties from us for their losses, and those claims, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and costly for us to address, and could have other consequences described in this “Risk Factors” section under the caption “Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to our reputation, business, and financial condition.” We have undertaken and continue to undertake certain system upgrades and re-platforming efforts designed to improve the availability, reliability, resiliency, and speed of our platform. These efforts are costly and time-consuming, involve significant technical risk, and may divert our resources from new features and products, and there can be no guarantee that these efforts will be effective. Frequent or persistent site interruptions could lead to regulatory scrutiny, significant fines and penalties, and mandatory and costly changes to our business practices, and ultimately could cause us to lose existing licenses that we need to operate or prevent or delay us from obtaining additional licenses that may be required for our business.We also rely on facilities, components, applications, and services supplied by third parties, including data center facilities and cloud data storage and processing services. From time to time, we have experienced interruptions in the provision of such facilities and services provided by these third parties. If these third parties experience operational interference or disruptions (including a cybersecurity incident), breach their agreements with us, or fail to perform their obligations and meet our expectations, our operations could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected, which could result in customer dissatisfaction, regulatory scrutiny, and damage to our reputation and brands, and materially and adversely affect our business. While we maintain insurance policies intended to offset the financial impact we may experience from these risks, our coverage may be insufficient to compensate us for all losses caused by interruptions in our service as a result of systems failures and similar events.In addition, any failure to successfully implement new information systems and technologies, or improvements or upgrades to existing information systems and technologies in a timely manner could have an adverse impact on our business, internal controls (including internal controls over financial reporting), results of operations, and financial condition. 17 If we cannot keep pace with rapid technological developments to provide new and innovative products and services, the use of our products and services and, consequently, our revenues, could decline. Rapid, significant, and disruptive technological changes impact the industries in which we operate, for example, payment technologies (including real-time payments, payment card tokenization, virtual currencies, distributed ledger and blockchain technologies, and proximity payment technology such as Near Field Communication and other contactless payments); internet browser technologies, that enable users to easily store their payment card information for use on any retail or e-commerce website; artificial intelligence and machine learning; developments in technologies supporting our regulatory and compliance obligations; and in-store, digital, and social commerce.We expect new services and technologies to continue to emerge and evolve. We cannot predict the effects of technological changes on our business, which technological developments or innovations will become widely adopted, and how those technologies may be regulated. We rely in part on third parties, including some of our competitors, for the development of and access to new or evolving technologies. These third parties may restrict or prevent our access to, or utilization of, those technologies, as well as their platforms or products. We expect that new services and technologies applicable to the industries in which we operate will continue to emerge and may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies we currently use in our products and services. Developing and incorporating new technologies into our products and services may require significant investment, take considerable time, and ultimately may not be successful. Our ability to adopt new products and services and to develop new technologies may be limited or restricted by industry-wide standards, platform providers, payments networks, changes to laws and regulations, changing expectations of consumers or merchants, third-party intellectual property rights, and other factors. Our success will depend on our ability to develop and incorporate new technologies and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards. If we are unable to do so in a timely or cost-effective manner, our business could be harmed. LEGAL, REGULATORY AND COMPLIANCE RISKS Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight. Our failure to comply with extensive, complex, overlapping, and frequently changing rules, regulations, and legal interpretations could materially harm our business. Our business is subject to complex and changing laws, rules, regulations, policies, and legal interpretations in the markets in which we offer services directly or through partners, including, but not limited to, those governing: banking, credit, deposit taking, cross-border and domestic money transmission, prepaid access, foreign currency exchange, privacy, data protection, data governance, cybersecurity, banking secrecy, digital payments, cryptocurrency, payment services (including payment processing and settlement services), fraud detection, consumer protection, antitrust and competition, economic and trade sanctions, anti-money laundering, and counter-terrorist financing.Regulators globally have been establishing and increasing their regulatory authority, oversight, and enforcement in a manner that impacts our business. As we introduce new products and services and expand into new markets, including through acquisitions, we expect to become subject to additional regulations, restrictions, and licensing requirements. As we expand and localize our international activities, we expect that our obligations in the markets in which we operate will continue to increase. In addition, because we facilitate sales of goods and provide services to customers worldwide, one or more jurisdictions may claim that we or our customers are required to comply with their laws, which may impose different, more specific, or conflicting obligations on us, as well as broader liability. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or new laws, regulations, or orders of any government authority (including changes to or expansion of their interpretation) may subject us to significant fines, penalties, criminal and civil lawsuits, forfeiture of significant assets, and enforcement actions in one or more jurisdictions; result in additional compliance and licensure requirements; cause us to lose existing licenses or prevent or delay us from obtaining additional licenses that may be required for our business; increase regulatory scrutiny of our business; divert management’s time and attention from our business; restrict our operations; lead to increased friction for customers; force us to make changes to our business practices, products or operations; require us to engage in remediation activities; or delay planned transactions, product launches or improvements. Any of the foregoing could, individually or in the aggregate, harm our reputation, damage our brands and business, and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The complexity of United States (“U.S.”) federal and state and international regulatory and enforcement regimes, coupled with the global scope of our operations and the evolving global regulatory environment, could result in a single event prompting a large number of overlapping investigations and legal and regulatory proceedings by multiple government authorities in different jurisdictions. While we have implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, and agents will not violate such laws and regulations. 18 Payments Regulation In the U.S., PayPal, Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary) holds licenses to operate as a money transmitter (or its equivalent) in the states where such licenses are required, as well as in the District of Columbia and certain territories. If we violate the laws or regulations covered under our licenses, we could be subject to liability and/or additional restrictions, forced to cease doing business with residents of certain states or territories, forced to change our business practices, or required to obtain additional licenses or regulatory approvals, which could impose substantial costs and harm our business. While we currently allow our customers to send payments from approximately 200 markets, we allow customers in only approximately half of those markets (including the U.S.) to also receive payments, in some cases with significant restrictions on the manner in which customers can hold balances or withdraw funds. These limitations may adversely affect our ability to grow our business.We principally provide our services to customers in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) through PayPal (Europe), our wholly-owned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a credit institution in Luxembourg. PayPal (Europe) is potentially subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if it violates applicable requirements. Additionally, compliance with applicable laws and regulations could become more costly and operationally difficult to manage due to potentially inconsistent interpretations and domestic regulations by various countries in the region. European regulation, such as the Revised Payment Services Directive (“PSD2”) enabling payment and account information sharing by regulated payment providers, could subject us to data security and other legal and financial risks. If the business activities of PayPal (Europe) exceed certain thresholds, or if the European Central Bank (“ECB”) determines, PayPal (Europe) may be deemed a significant supervised entity and certain activity of PayPal (Europe) would become directly supervised by the ECB, rather than by the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier, which could subject us to additional requirements and would likely increase compliance costs.In many of the other markets outside the U.S. in which we do business, we serve our customers through PayPal Pte. Ltd., our wholly-owned subsidiary based in Singapore. PayPal Pte. Ltd. is supervised by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”), but does not hold a remittance license. As a result, PayPal Pte. Ltd. is not able to offer outbound remittance payments to PayPal customers from Singapore. In many of the markets (other than Singapore) served by PayPal Pte. Ltd., it is unclear and uncertain whether our Singapore-based service is subject only to Singapore law or, if it is subject to the application of local laws, whether such local laws would require a payment processor like us to be licensed as a payments service, bank, financial institution, or otherwise. The Payment Services Act came into effect in Singapore in January 2020. PayPal Pte. Ltd. has submitted an application for a Major Payment Institution license to the MAS to continue to provide payments services, and is operating under an exemption from holding a license within a statutory transition period while the application is pending. Once PayPal Pte. Ltd. obtains its license, we will be required to comply with new regulatory requirements, which will result in increased operational complexity and costs for our Singapore and international operations. In addition, in certain markets outside of the U.S., we provide our services to customers through PayPal Pte. Ltd. or, if required by local regulations, a local branch of PayPal Pte. Ltd. or a local subsidiary subject to local regulatory supervision or oversight. From time to time, we may also acquire entities subject to local payments regulatory supervision or oversight. There are substantial costs and potential product and operational changes involved in maintaining and renewing licenses, certifications, and approvals, and we could be subject to fines, other enforcement actions, and litigation if we are found to violate any of these requirements. There can be no assurance that we will be able to (or decide to) continue to apply for or obtain any licenses, renewals, certifications, and approvals in any jurisdictions. In certain markets, we may rely on local banks or other partners to process payments and conduct foreign currency exchange transactions in local currency, and local regulators may use their authority over such local partners to prohibit, restrict, or limit us from doing business. The need to obtain or maintain licenses, certifications, or other regulatory approvals could impose substantial additional costs, delay or preclude planned transactions, product launches or improvements, require significant and costly operational changes, impose restrictions, limitations, or additional requirements on our business, products and services, or prevent us from providing our products or services in a given market. Cryptocurrency Regulation Our current and planned cryptocurrency offerings could subject us to additional regulations, licensing requirements, or other obligations. The rapidly evolving regulatory landscape with respect to cryptocurrency may subject us to inquiries or investigations from regulators and governmental authorities, require us to make product changes, restrict or discontinue product offerings, and implement additional and potentially costly controls. If we fail to comply with regulations, requirements, 19 prohibitions or other obligations applicable to us, we could face regulatory or other enforcement actions and potential fines and other consequences.In addition, financial and third party risks related to our cryptocurrency offerings, such as inappropriate access to or theft or destruction of cryptocurrency assets held by our custodian, insufficient insurance coverage by the custodian to reimburse us for all such losses, the custodian’s failure to maintain effective controls over the custody and settlement services provided to us, the custodian’s inability to purchase or liquidate cryptocurrency holdings, and defaults on financial or performance obligations by counterparty financial institutions, could materially and adversely affect our financial performance and significantly harm our business. Lending Regulation We hold a number of U.S. state lending licenses for our U.S. consumer short-term installment loan product, which is subject to federal and state laws governing consumer credit and debt collection. While our non-U.S. consumer short-term installment loan products which are available in the U.K., France, Germany, Spain, Italy and Australia are generally exempt from primary consumer credit legislation, certain consumer lending laws, consumer protection or banking transparency regulations continue to apply to these products. Increased global regulatory focus on short-term installment products and consumer credit more broadly could result in laws or regulations requiring changes to our policies, procedures, operations, and product offerings, and restrict or limit our ability to offer credit products. We could be subject to fines, other enforcement action, and litigation if we are found to violate any aspects of applicable law or regulations. Consumer Protection Violations of federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations, including the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (“EFTA”) and Regulation E as implemented by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), could result in the assessment of significant actual damages or statutory damages or penalties (including treble damages in some instances) and plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees. We are subject to, and have paid amounts in settlement of, lawsuits containing allegations that our business violated the EFTA and Regulation E or otherwise advance claims for relief relating to our business practices (e.g., that we improperly held consumer funds or otherwise improperly limited consumer accounts).In October 2021, the CFPB issued an order pursuant to its market-monitoring authority requiring us to provide extensive information on our payment products, including with respect to the collection, use of, and access to data and consumer protections, among other items. In December 2021, the CFPB issued a separate order pursuant to its market-monitoring authority requiring us to provide information on our Buy Now, Pay Later offerings.PayPal principally offers its services in the EEA countries through a “passport” notification process through PayPal Europe's Luxembourg regulator to regulators in other EEA member states in accordance with EU regulations, as well as in the UK through the Temporary Permissions Regime. Regulators in these countries could notify us of and seek to enforce local consumer protection laws that apply to our business, in addition to Luxembourg consumer protection laws, and could also seek to persuade the local regulator to order PayPal to conduct its activities in the local country directly or through a branch office. These or similar actions by these regulators could increase the cost of, or delay, our ability to expand our business in Europe. Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing; Economic and Trade Sanctions Regulators in the U.S. and around the world continue to increase standards and expectations regarding anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing, and to expand the scope of existing laws and regulations to emerging products and markets, which may require us to further revise or expand our compliance program globally and/or in specific jurisdictions, including the procedures we use to verify the identity of our customers and to monitor international and domestic transactions. Such changes could have the effect of making compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage, lead to increased friction for customers, and result in a decrease in business. Regulators regularly re-examine the transaction volume thresholds at which we must obtain and keep applicable records or verify identities of customers and any change in such thresholds could result in greater compliance costs and impact our business. In addition, we are required to comply with economic and trade sanctions administered by the U.S., the EU, relevant EU member states, and other jurisdictions in which we operate. Non-compliance with anti-money laundering laws and regulations or economic and trade sanctions may subject us to significant fines, penalties, lawsuits, and enforcement actions, result in regulatory sanctions and additional compliance requirements, increase regulatory scrutiny of our business, restrict our operations, and damage our reputation and brands. See “Note 13—Commitments and Contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements for disclosure relating to possible violations arising from our sanctions compliance program. 20 Privacy and Protection of Customer Data The legal and regulatory environment relating to privacy and data protection laws continues to develop and evolve in ways we cannot predict, including with respect to technologies such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, cryptocurrency, and blockchain technology. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our privacy policies as communicated to customers or with privacy and data protection laws could result in proceedings or actions against us by data protection authorities, government entities, or others. Such proceedings or actions could subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments, and negative publicity, require us to change our business practices, increase the costs and complexity of compliance, result in reputational harm, and materially harm our business. In addition, compliance with inconsistent privacy and data protection laws may restrict or limit our ability to provide products and services to our customers.PayPal relies on a variety of compliance methods to transfer personal data of EEA individuals to the U.S., including Binding Corporate Rules for internal transfers of certain types of personal data and Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”) as approved by the European Commission for transfers to and from third parties. In June 2021, the European Commission imposed new SCC requirements which impose certain contract and operational requirements on PayPal, its merchants, and vendors in order to adhere to certain affirmative duties, including requirements related to government access transparency, enhanced data subject rights, and broader third party assessments to ensure safeguards necessary to protect personal data exported from PayPal’s EEA customers and/or employees to countries outside the EEA. To the extent PayPal relies on SCCs, such engagements will require new contractual arrangements under the updated requirements to avoid limitations on PayPal’s ability to process EEA data in countries outside of the EEA.In the wake of the California Consumer Privacy Act passed in 2018, multiple U.S. states have adopted or proposed similar legislation to protect consumers in their states. California passed the Consumer Privacy Rights Act of 2020, and Virginia and Colorado have passed similar privacy and data protection laws. The continued increase in state-level privacy laws is likely to result in a disparate array of privacy rules with unaligned or conflicting provisions, accountability requirements, individual rights, and state enforcement powers and may subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny and business costs, and lead to unintended consumer confusion. We are subject to regulatory scrutiny and may be subject to legal proceedings under antitrust and competition laws. We are subject to scrutiny by various government agencies regarding antitrust and competition laws and regulations in the U.S. and internationally, including in connection with proposed or implemented business combinations, acquisitions, investments, partnerships, commercial agreements and business practices. Some jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to assert claims of anticompetitive conduct. Other companies and government agencies have in the past and may in the future allege that our actions violate the antitrust or competition laws of the U.S., individual states, other countries, or the EU, or otherwise constitute unfair competition. Some regulators and legislators, particularly those outside of the U.S., may perceive that our products and services are used so broadly that otherwise uncontroversial business practices could be deemed anticompetitive. Any claims or investigations, even if without merit, may be very expensive to defend or respond to, involve negative publicity, and substantial diversion of management time and effort, and could result in reputational harm, significant judgments, fines and remedial actions against us, or require us to change our business practices, make product or operational changes, or delay or preclude planned transactions, product launches or improvements. We are regularly subject to general litigation, regulatory scrutiny, and government inquiries. We are regularly subject to claims, individual and class action lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government and regulatory investigations, inquiries, actions or requests, and other proceedings alleging violations of laws, rules, and regulations with respect to competition, antitrust, intellectual property, privacy, data protection, information security, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, sanctions, anti-bribery, anti-corruption, consumer protection, fraud, accessibility, securities, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, services, charitable fundraising, contract disputes, escheatment of unclaimed or abandoned property, product liability, use of our services for illegal purposes, the matters described in “Note 13—Commitments and Contingencies—Litigation and Regulatory Matters—General Matters” to our consolidated financial statements, and other matters. The number and significance of these disputes and inquiries has increased and is expected to continue to increase as our products, services, and business expand in complexity, scale, scope, and geographic reach, including through acquisitions of businesses and technology. Investigations and legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, expensive and disruptive to our operations, and could result in substantial payments to satisfy judgments, fines, penalties or settlements, negative publicity, substantial diversion of management time and effort, reputational harm, criminal sanctions, or orders that prevent or limit us from offering certain products or services; require us to change our business practices in costly ways, develop non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies, or pay substantial royalty or licensing fees; or delay or preclude planned transactions, product launches or improvements. Determining legal reserves or possible losses from such 21 matters involves judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes. We may be exposed to losses in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material. If any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Third parties may allege that we are infringing their patents and other intellectual property rights. We are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. At any given time, we are typically a defendant in a number of patent lawsuits and subject to intellectual property infringement claims. Intellectual property infringement claims against us may result from, among other things, our expansion into new business areas, including through acquisitions of businesses and technology, and new or expanded products and services and their convergence with technologies not previously associated with areas related to our business, products, and services. The ultimate outcome of any allegation or claim is often uncertain and any such claim, with or without merit, may be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert management’s time and attention from our business, result in reputational harm, and require us to, among other things, redesign or stop providing our products or services, pay substantial amounts to settle claims or lawsuits, satisfy judgments, or pay substantial royalty or licensing fees. We may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights. The protection of our intellectual property, including our trademarks, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, patents and trade secrets, is important to the success of our business. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every jurisdiction in which we offer our products and services. Although we have generally taken measures to protect our intellectual property rights, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in protecting or enforcing our rights in every jurisdiction, or that our contractual arrangements will prevent or deter third parties from infringing or misappropriating our intellectual property, or that third parties may independently develop equivalent or superior intellectual property rights. We may be required to expend significant time and resources to prevent third party infringement and enforce our rights, and we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. If we are unable to prevent third parties from using or offering technologies that infringe our patent or trade secret rights, the uniqueness and value of our products and services could be adversely affected. If we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting, registering, or using trademarks and trade dress that infringe, dilute, or otherwise violate our trademark rights, the value of our brands could be diminished and our business could be adversely affected. We have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to others. These licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation. Any failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or significant costs incurred in doing so, could diminish the value of our intangible assets and materially harm our business. BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS RISKS The continuing effects of the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The ultimate extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, financial condition, and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, difficult to predict, and subject to change, including, but not limited to, the duration, scope, severity, proliferation of variants and increase in the transmissibility of the virus, its impact on the global economy, actions taken to contain or limit the impact of COVID-19, such as the availability of an effective vaccine or treatment, geographic variation in how countries and states are handling the pandemic, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions may potentially resume.The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted and is likely to further adversely impact the operations of our customers, suppliers, vendors and other business partners, and may adversely impact our results of operations in the future. Cross-border and domestic commerce may be adversely impacted by measures taken by government authorities and businesses globally to contain and limit the spread of COVID-19, including travel restrictions, border closures, quarantines, shelter in place and lock down orders, mask and social distancing requirements, and business limitations and shutdowns. To the extent that such mitigation measures remain in place or are reinstated for significant periods of time, they may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Actions that we have taken or may take in the future intended to assist customers impacted by COVID-19 may negatively impact our results of operations. In particular, we have experienced and may continue to experience adverse financial impacts from a number of operational factors, including, but not limited to: increased liability under our buyer protection program or chargebacks on payment cards resulting from merchants’ selling goods or services in advance of the delivery date or experiencing bankruptcy, insolvency or other business interruption; customer defaults on 22 payment obligations under PayPal branded credit products; increased cybersecurity and payment fraud risk; challenges to the availability and reliability of our products and services; and supply chain disruptions impacting our business.While our business has benefited from the shift from in-store shopping and traditional payment methods towards e-commerce and digital payments, to the extent that customer preferences revert to pre-COVID-19 behaviors as the pandemic-related restrictions lessen, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely impacted.The significant increase in the number of our employees who are working remotely as a result of the pandemic, and an extended period of remote work arrangements and subsequent reintroduction into the workplace could introduce operational risk, increase cybersecurity risk, strain our business continuity plans, negatively impact productivity, and give rise to claims by employees or otherwise adversely affect our business. Additionally, COVID-19 could require new or modified processes, procedures, and controls to respond to changes in our business environment. We may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, and business partners. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by COVID-19 or will otherwise be satisfactory to government authorities.The impacts of COVID-19, individually or collectively, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and have the effect of heightening or exacerbating many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section. We face substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry. The global payments industry is highly competitive, continuously changing, highly innovative, and increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny and oversight. Many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with innovative and disruptive technologies, shifting user preferences and needs, price sensitivity of merchants and consumers, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Competition also may intensify as new competitors emerge, businesses enter into business combinations and partnerships, and established companies in other segments expand to become competitive with various aspects of our business.We compete with a wide range of businesses in every aspect of our business. Some of our current and potential competitors are larger than we are, have larger customer bases, greater brand recognition, longer operating histories, a dominant or more secure position, broader geographic scope, volume, scale, resources, and market share than we do, or offer products and services that we do not offer. Other competitors are smaller or younger companies that may be more agile in responding quickly to regulatory and technological changes. Our competitors may devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of products and services, and/or offer lower prices or more effectively offer their own innovative programs, products, and services. We often partner with many of these businesses and we consider the ability to continue establishing these partnerships to be important to our business. Competition for relationships with these partners is intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to establish, grow, or maintain these partner relationships. If we are not able to differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors, drive value for our customers, or effectively and efficiently align our resources with our goals and objectives, we may not be able to compete effectively. See “Item 1. Business—Competition” of this Form 10-K for further discussion of the competitive environment in the markets where we operate. Changes to payment card networks or bank fees, rules, or practices could harm our business. To process certain transactions, we must comply with applicable payment card, bank or other network (collectively, “network”) rules. The rules govern all aspects of a transaction on the networks, including fees and other practices. From time to time, the networks have increased the fees and assessments that they charge for transactions that access their networks. Certain networks have also imposed special fees or assessments for transactions that are executed through a digital wallet such as the one that PayPal offers. Our payment processors may have the right to pass any increases in fees and assessments on to us as well as increase their own fees for processing. Any increase in interchange fees, special fees, or assessments for transactions that we pay to the networks or our payment processors could make our pricing less competitive, increase our operating costs, and reduce our operating income, which could materially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.In some jurisdictions, government regulations have required the payment card networks to reduce or cap interchange fees. Any changes in interchange fee rates or limitations, or their applicability to PayPal, could adversely affect our competitive position against payment card service providers and the revenue we earn from our branded card programs, require us to change our business practices, and harm our business. 23 We may also be subject to fines assessed by the networks resulting from any rule violations by us or our merchants. The networks set and interpret their rules and have alleged from time to time that various aspects of our business model violate these operating rules. Such allegations may result in significant fines and penalties or require changes in our business practices that may be costly and adversely affect our business. The network rules may also increase the cost of, impose restrictions on, or otherwise impact the development of, our products which may negatively affect their deployment and adoption. The networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or re-interpret existing rules that we or our payment processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow, or costly to implement, which could require us to make significant changes to our products. If we become unable or limited in our ability to accept certain payment types such as debit or credit cards, our business would be adversely affected. Changes in how consumers fund their PayPal transactions could harm our business. We pay transaction fees when consumers fund payment transactions using credit cards, lower fees when consumers fund payments with debit cards, and nominal fees when consumers fund payment transactions by electronic transfer of funds from bank accounts, from an existing PayPal account balance or Venmo account balance, or through our PayPal branded consumer credit products. Our financial performance is sensitive to changes in the rate at which our consumers fund payments using payment cards, which can significantly increase our costs. Although we provide consumers in certain markets with the opportunity to use their existing PayPal account balance or Venmo account balance to fund payment transactions, some of our consumers may prefer to use payment cards, which may offer features and benefits not provided as part of their PayPal accounts. An increase in the portion of our payment volume funded using payment cards or in fees associated with our funding mix, or other events or developments that make it more difficult or costly for us to fund transactions with lower-cost funding options, could materially and adversely affect our financial performance and significantly harm our business. Our ability to receive the benefit of U.S. merchant financing offerings may be subject to challenge. Merchant loans under our U.S. PayPal Working Capital (“PPWC”) and PayPal Business Loan (“PPBL”) products are provided by a state chartered industrial bank under a program agreement with us, and we acquire the receivables generated by those loans after origination. In June 2020, largely in response to the Madden v. Midland Funding, LLC case decided in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) approved a final rule clarifying that loans originated by state-chartered non-member banks remain valid throughout the lifetime of the loan, reflecting a similar rule finalized by the Office of the Comptroller of Currency (“OCC”) in May 2020. The final rule reaffirms and codifies in regulation the so-called “valid-when-made doctrine,” which provides that the interest rate for a loan is determined when the loan is made and will not be affected by subsequent events such as sale, assignment, or other transfer. A number of state attorneys general have challenged these FDIC and OCC rules, and there remains some uncertainty whether non-bank entities purchasing loan receivables originated by FDIC-insured, state chartered industrial banks may rely on federal preemption of state usury laws and other state laws. An adverse outcome of these or similar challenges, or changes to applicable laws and regulations or regulatory policy, could materially impact our U.S. PPWC and PPBL products and our business. Our credit products expose us to additional risks. We offer credit products to a wide range of consumers and merchants in the U.S. and various international markets. The financial success of these products depends on the effective management of related risk. The credit decision-making process for our consumer credit products uses proprietary methodologies and credit algorithms and other analytical techniques designed to analyze the credit risk of specific consumers based on, among other factors, their past purchase and transaction history with PayPal or Venmo and their credit scores. Similarly, proprietary risk models and other indicators are applied to assess merchants who desire to use our merchant financing offerings to help predict their ability to repay. These risk models may not accurately predict the creditworthiness of a consumer or merchant due to inaccurate assumptions, including those related to the particular consumer or merchant, market conditions, economic environment, or limited transaction history or other data. The accuracy of these risk models and the ability to manage credit risk related to our credit products may also be affected by legal or regulatory requirements, changes in consumer behavior, changes in the economic environment, issuing bank policies, and other factors. We generally rely on third-party chartered financial institutions to provide PayPal and Venmo branded consumer credit and merchant financing offerings to our U.S. customers. As a service provider to these third-party chartered financial institutions, which are federally supervised U.S. financial institutions, we are subject from time to time to examination by their federal banking regulators. In the event of any termination or interruption in a partner bank’s ability or willingness to lend, our ability to offer consumer credit and merchant financing products could be interrupted or limited, which could materially and adversely affect our business. We may be unable to reach a similar arrangement with another chartered financial institution on favorable terms or at all. Obtaining licenses to originate such loans would be a costly, time-consuming and uncertain process, and would subject us to additional laws and regulatory requirements, which could significantly increase our costs and compliance 24 obligations and require us to change our business practices.We are subject to the risk that account holders who use our credit products will default on their payment obligations, creating the risk of potential charge-offs or negative impact to revenue share arrangement with Synchrony Bank with respect to our U.S. consumer credit product. The non-payment rate among account holders may increase due to, among other factors, changes to underwriting standards, risk models not accurately predicting the creditworthiness of a user, worsening economic conditions, such as a recession or government austerity programs, increases in prevailing interest rates, and high unemployment rates. Account holders who miss payments often fail to repay their loans, and account holders who file for protection under the bankruptcy laws generally do not repay their loans. We currently purchase receivables related to our PayPal branded merchant financing offerings in the U.S. and extend credit for our consumer and merchants products outside the U.S. through our international subsidiaries. If we are unable to fund our credit products, or the purchase of the receivables related to our merchant financing offerings in the U.S. adequately or in a cost-effective manner, or if we are unable to efficiently manage the cash resources utilized for these purposes, the growth of our credit products could be negatively impacted.For information on lending regulations that impact our business, see “Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight. Our failure to comply with extensive, complex, overlapping, and frequently changing rules, regulations, and legal interpretations could materially harm our business—Lending Regulation” in this risk factor section. We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk. We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, including, but not limited to: networks, banks, payment processors, and payment gateways that link us to the payment card and bank clearing networks to process transactions; unaffiliated third-party lenders to originate our U.S. credit products to consumers, U.S. merchant financing, and branded credit card products; PayPal-branded debit card products issued by an unaffiliated bank; cryptocurrency custodial service providers; and external business partners and contractors who provide key functions (e.g., outsourced customer support and product development functions; facilities; information technology, data center facilities and cloud computing). These risks include legal, regulatory, information security, reputational, operational, or any other risks inherent in engaging and relying upon a third-party. If we are unable to effectively manage our third-party relationships, these third parties are unable to meet their obligations to us, or we experience substantial disruptions in these relationships, our operations, results of operations, and financial results could be adversely impacted. Additionally, while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships, they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, governance, and compliance, thereby potentially increasing our financial, legal, reputational, and operational risk. Any factors that reduce cross-border trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business. Cross-border trade (i.e., transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries) is an important source of our revenues and profits. Cross-border transactions generally provide higher revenues and operating income than similar transactions that take place within a single country or market. In certain markets, cross-border trade represents our primary (and in some instances our only) presence. Cross-border trade may be negatively impacted by various factors including, but not limited to, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions in the context of cross-border trade and foreign exchange. Any factors that increase the costs of cross-border trade for us or our customers or that restrict, delay, or make cross-border trade more difficult or impractical, such as trade policy, higher tariffs, or localization requirements, could reduce our cross-border transactions and volume, negatively impact our revenues and profits, and harm our business. Failure to deal effectively with fraud, abusive behaviors, bad transactions, and negative customer experiences would increase our loss rate and could negatively impact our business and severely diminish merchant and consumer confidence in and use of our services. Third parties have attempted, and we expect that they will likely continue to attempt, to abuse access to and misuse our payment services to commit fraud by, among other things, creating fictitious PayPal accounts using stolen or synthetic identities or personal information, making transactions with stolen financial instruments, abusing or misusing our services for financial gain, or fraudulently inducing users of our systems into engaging in bad transactions. Due to the nature of PayPal’s digital payments services, third parties may seek to engage in abusive schemes or fraud attacks that are often difficult to detect and may be deployed at a scale that would otherwise not be possible in physical transactions. Measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud and abusive behavior are complex, require continuous improvement, and may not be effective in detecting and preventing 25 fraud, particularly new and continually evolving forms of fraud or in connection with new or expanded product offerings. If these measures do not succeed, our business could be negatively impacted. We also incur substantial losses from erroneous transactions and situations where funding instruments used for legitimate transactions are closed or have insufficient funds to satisfy payments, or the payment is made to an unintended recipient in error. Numerous and evolving fraud schemes and misuse of our payments service could subject us to significant costs and liabilities, require us to change our business practices, cause us to incur significant remediation costs, lead to loss of customer confidence in, or decreased use of, our products and services, damage our reputation and brands, divert the attention of management from the operation of our business, and result in significant compensation or contractual penalties from us to our customers and their business partners as a result of losses to or claims by them.Our buyer and seller protection programs are intended to reduce the likelihood of losses for consumers and merchants from fraudulent transactions. The buyer protection program also, protects consumers if they do not receive the item ordered or if the item received is significantly different from its description. We incur substantial losses from our buyer and seller protection programs as a result of disputes filed by our customers. We seek to recover losses from our buyer and seller protection programs from the merchant, but may not be able to fully recover them if the merchant is unwilling or unable to pay, the transaction involves a fraudulent merchant, or the merchant provides sufficient evidence that the item was delivered. In addition, consumers who pay through PayPal or Venmo may have reimbursement rights from their payment card issuer, which in turn will seek recovery from us. If losses incurred by us related to payment card transactions become excessive, we could lose the ability to accept payment cards for payment, which would negatively impact our business. Regulators and card networks may also adapt error resolution and chargeback requirements to account for evolving forms of fraud, which could increase PayPal’s exposure to fraud losses and impact the scope of coverage of our buyer and seller protection programs. Increases in our loss rate, including as a result of changes to the scope of transactions covered by our buyer and seller protection programs, could negatively impact our business. See “Note 13—Commitments and Contingencies—Protection Programs” to our consolidated financial statements.Failure to effectively monitor and evaluate the financial condition of our merchants may also expose PayPal to losses. In the event of the bankruptcy, insolvency, business failure, or other business interruption of a merchant that sells goods or services in advance of the date of their delivery or use (e.g., airline, cruise, or concert tickets, custom-made goods, and subscriptions), we could be liable to the buyers of such goods or services, including through our buyer protection program or through chargebacks on payment cards used by customers to fund their payments. Allowances for transaction losses that we have established may be insufficient to cover incurred losses. Use of our payments services for illegal activities or improper purposes could harm our business. Users have attempted, and may attempt in the future, to use our payments platform for illegal activities or improper uses, such as money laundering, terrorist financing, sanctions evasion, illegal online gambling, fraudulent sales of goods or services, illegal telemarketing activities, illegal sales of prescription medications or controlled substances, piracy of software, movies, music, and other copyrighted or trademarked goods (in particular, digital goods), bank fraud, child pornography, human trafficking, prohibited sales of alcoholic beverages or tobacco products, securities fraud, pyramid or ponzi schemes, or the facilitation of other illegal or improper activity. Moreover, certain activity that may be legal in one jurisdiction may be illegal in another jurisdiction, and a merchant may be found responsible for intentionally or inadvertently importing or exporting illegal goods, resulting in liability for us. Owners of intellectual property rights or government authorities may seek to bring legal action against providers of payments solutions, including PayPal, that are peripherally involved in the sale of infringing or allegedly infringing items. While we invest in measures intended to prevent and detect illegal activities that may occur within our payments platform, these measures require continuous improvement and may not be effective in detecting and preventing illegal activity or improper uses.Any illegal or improper uses of our payments platform by our users may subject us to claims, individual and class action lawsuits, and government and regulatory requests, inquiries, or investigations that could result in liability, restrict our operations, require us to change our business practices, harm our reputation, increase our costs, and negatively impact our business. For example, government enforcement or regulatory authorities could seek to impose additional restrictions or liability on us arising from the use of our payments platform for illegal or improper activity, and our failure to detect or prevent such use. Acquisitions, strategic investments, and other strategic transactions could result in operating difficulties and could harm our business. 26 We expect to continue to consider and evaluate a wide array of potential strategic transactions as part of our overall business strategy, including, but not limited to, business combinations, acquisitions, and dispositions of certain businesses, technologies, services, products, and other assets; strategic investments; and commercial and strategic partnerships (collectively, “strategic transactions”). At any given time, we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more strategic transactions, any of which could, individually or in the aggregate, be material to our financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying, negotiating, consummating and integrating favorable transaction opportunities. Strategic transactions may involve additional significant challenges, uncertainties, and risks, including, but not limited to, challenges of integrating new employees, products, systems, technologies, operations, and business cultures; challenges associated with operating acquired businesses in markets in which we may have limited or no experience; failure to develop the acquired business adequately; disruption of our ongoing operations and diversion of our management’s attention; inadequate data security, cybersecurity and operational and information technology resilience; failure to identify, or our underestimation of, commitments, liabilities, deficiencies and other risks associated with acquired businesses or assets; potential exposure to new risks associated with acquired businesses and entities, including potential new or increased regulatory oversight and uncertain or evolving legal, regulatory, and compliance requirements; potential reputational risks that could arise from transactions with, or investments in, companies, particularly those involved in new or developing businesses or industries, which may be subject to uncertain or evolving legal, regulatory, and compliance requirements; failure of the transaction to advance our business strategy and of its anticipated benefits to materialize; potential impairment of goodwill or other acquisition-related intangible assets; and the potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities or significant additional debt. Strategic transactions may also heighten many of the risks described in this “Risk Factors” section. These transactions are inherently risky, may not be successful, and may harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Strategic investments in which we have a minority ownership stake inherently involve a lesser degree of influence over business operations. We may be dependent on controlling shareholders, management, or other persons or entities who control them and who may have business interests, strategies, or goals that are inconsistent with ours. Business decisions or other actions or omissions of the controlling shareholders, management, or other persons or entities who control companies in which we invest may adversely affect the value of our investment, result in litigation or regulatory action against us, and damage our reputation and brand. Our international operations subject us to increased risks, which could harm our business. Our international operations generate approximately one-half of our net revenues. Our international operations, including any expansion in international markets, subject us to significant challenges, uncertainties, and risks, including, but not limited to: local regulatory, licensing, reporting, and legal obligations; costs and challenges associated with operating in markets in which we may have limited or no experience, including effectively localizing our products and services and adapting them to local preferences; difficulties in developing, staffing, and simultaneously managing a large number of varying foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences and in light of varying laws, regulations, and customs; differing employment practices and the existence of works councils; difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified employees and maintaining our company culture; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; exchange control regulations; profit repatriation restrictions; potential tariffs, sanctions, fines, or other trade barriers or restrictions; import or export regulations; compliance with U.S. and foreign anti-bribery, anti-corruption, sanctions, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws and regulations; the interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions; and national or regional political, economic, or social instability.Our international operations also may heighten many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section. Any violations of the complex foreign and U.S. laws, rules and regulations that may apply to our international operations may result in fines, criminal actions, or sanctions against us and, our directors, officers, and employees; prohibit or require us to change our business practices; and damage our reputation. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies. These risks are inherent in our international operations, may increase our costs of doing business internationally, and could materially and adversely affect our business. Brexit: The U.K.’s departure from the EU could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Following the departure of the U.K. from the EU and the EEA on January 31, 2020 (commonly referred to as “Brexit”) and the expiration of the transition period on December 31, 2020, there continues to be uncertainty over the practical consequences of Brexit including the potential for Brexit to contribute to long-term instability in financial, stock and currency exchange markets, greater restrictions on the supply and availability of goods and services between the U.K. and EEA region, and a general deterioration in consumer sentiment and credit conditions leading to overall negative economic growth and increased risk of 27 merchant default.The consequences of Brexit have brought legal uncertainty and increased complexity for financial services firms, which could continue as national laws and regulations in the U.K. differ from EU laws and regulations and additional authorization requirements come into effect. These developments have led and could lead in the future to additional regulatory costs and challenges for us, including, but not limited to, the following:•PayPal (Europe) operates in the U.K. within the scope of its passport permissions (as they existed at the end of the transition period) pursuant to the Temporary Permissions Regime pending the grant of new U.K. authorizations by the U.K. financial regulators. If we are unable to obtain the required authorizations before the expiry of the longstop dates set by the U.K. regulators under the Temporary Permissions Regime, our European operations could lose their ability to offer services into the U.K. market on a cross-border basis; and•our European operations being required to comply with new legal and regulatory requirements in the U.K. that may be in addition to, or inconsistent with, those of the EEA, in each case, leading to increased complexity and costs. Global and regional economic conditions could harm our business. Adverse global and regional economic conditions such as turmoil affecting the banking system or financial markets, including, but not limited to, tightening in the credit markets, extreme volatility or distress in the financial markets (including the fixed income, credit, currency, equity, and commodity markets), higher unemployment, high consumer debt levels, recessionary or inflationary pressures, supply chain issues, reduced consumer confidence or economic activity, government fiscal and tax policies, U.S. and international trade relationships, agreements, treaties, tariffs and restrictive actions, the inability of a government to enact a budget in a fiscal year, government shutdowns, government austerity programs, and other negative financial news or macroeconomic developments could have a material adverse impact on the demand for our products and services, including a reduction in the volume and size of transactions on our payments platform. Additionally, any inability to access the capital markets when needed due to volatility or illiquidity in the markets and increased regulatory liquidity and capital requirements may strain our liquidity position. Such conditions may also expose us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates that could materially and adversely affect our financial results. See “Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange Rates and Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” for additional information on our financial risks. Real or perceived inaccuracies in our metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business. Our key metrics are calculated using internal company data based on the activity we measure on our platform and may be compiled from multiple systems, including systems that are organically developed or acquired through business combinations. While the measurement of our key metrics is based on what we believe to be reasonable methodologies and estimates, there are inherent challenges and limitations in measuring our key metrics globally at scale. The methodologies used to calculate our key metrics require judgment. We regularly review our processes for calculating these key metrics, and from time to time we may make adjustments to improve their accuracy or relevance. For example, we continuously apply models, processes and practices designed to detect and prevent fraudulent account creation on our platforms, and work to improve and enhance those capabilities. When we detect a significant volume of illegitimate activity, we generally remove the activity identified from our key metrics. Although such adjustments may impact key metrics reported in prior periods, we generally do not update previously reported key metrics to reflect these subsequent adjustments unless the retrospective impact of process improvements or enhancements is determined by management to be material. Further, as our business develops, we may revise or cease reporting metrics if we determine that such metrics are no longer appropriate measures of our performance. If investors, analysts, or customers do not consider our reported measures to be sufficient or to accurately reflect our business, we may receive negative publicity, our reputation may be harmed, and our business may be adversely impacted. Environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) issues may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and damage our reputation. Customers, investors, employees and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on ESG practices, including our efforts with respect to global talent, cybersecurity, data privacy and protection and climate change. If we do not adapt to and comply with new laws and regulations or changes to legal or regulatory requirements concerning ESG matters, or fail to meet rapidly evolving investor, industry or stakeholder expectations and standards, or if the Company is perceived to have not responded appropriately to growing concerns with respect to ESG issues, our reputation may be harmed, customers may choose to refrain from using our products and services, and our business or financial condition may be adversely affected. 28 We specifically recognize the inherent physical climate-related risks wherever business is conducted. Our primary locations may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. For example, California, where our headquarters is located, has historically experienced, and is projected to continue to experience, climate-related events more frequently, including drought, water scarcity, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality impacts, and power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention. These extreme weather conditions may disrupt our business and may cause us to experience additional costs to maintain or resume operations and higher attrition. In addition, current and emerging legal and regulatory requirements with respect to climate change (e.g., carbon pricing) and other aspects of ESG (e.g., disclosure requirements) may result in increased compliance requirements on our business and supply chain, which may increase our operating costs and cause disruptions in our operations. If one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their financial or performance obligations to us or fail, we may incur significant losses. We have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents, receivables outstanding, and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the U.S. and international jurisdictions. As part of our currency hedging activities, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments with various financial institutions. Certain banks and financial institutions are also lenders under our credit facilities. We regularly monitor our exposure to counterparty credit risk, and actively manage this exposure to mitigate the associated risk. Despite these efforts, we may be exposed to the risk of default by, or deteriorating operating results or financial condition or failure of, these counterparty financial institutions. If one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or to access or recover our assets that are deposited, held in accounts with, or otherwise due from, such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty’s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties, we could incur significant losses, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. There are risks associated with our indebtedness. We have incurred indebtedness, and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations and generate sufficient cash flows to service such debt. Our outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness we incur may have significant consequences, including, without limitation: requiring us to use a significant portion of our cash flow from operations and other available cash to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes, including capital expenditures, acquisitions, strategic investments, and share repurchases; reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business, competition pressures and market conditions; and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, strategic investments, share repurchases, or other general corporate and other purposes.Our revolving credit facilities and the indentures for our senior unsecured notes pursuant to which certain of our outstanding debt securities were issued contain financial and other covenants that restrict or could restrict, among other things, our business and operations. If we fail to pay amounts due under a debt instrument or breach any of its covenants, the lenders would typically have the right to demand immediate repayment of all borrowings thereunder (subject in certain cases to a grace or cure period). Moreover, any such acceleration and required repayment of, or default in respect of, our indebtedness could, in turn, constitute an event of default under other debt instruments, thereby resulting in the acceleration and required repayment of our indebtedness. Any of these events could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.Changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity securities and increase our borrowing costs. If our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, the interest rates payable by us under our indebtedness may increase, and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected. Changes in tax laws, exposure to unanticipated additional tax liabilities, or implementation of record-keeping obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business. An increasing number of U.S. states, the U.S. federal government, and foreign jurisdictions, as well as international organizations, such as the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and the EU Commission, are focused on tax reform and other legislative or regulatory action to increase tax revenue. Various countries have proposed or enacted digital services taxes. These actions may materially affect our effective tax rate. 29 The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation and significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are currently undergoing a number of investigations, audits, and reviews by tax authorities in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could result in unforeseen tax-related liabilities that differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements, which may, individually or in the aggregate, materially affect our financial results in the periods for which such determination is made. While we have established reserves based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventualities, these reserves may prove to be insufficient.In addition, our future income taxes could be adversely affected by the incurrence of losses or earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates, and earnings being higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, including as a result of gains on our foreign currency exchange risk management program; by changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles; or by certain discrete items.A number of U.S. states, the U.S. federal government, and foreign jurisdictions have implemented and may impose reporting or record-keeping obligations on companies that engage in or facilitate e-commerce to improve tax compliance. A number of jurisdictions are also reviewing whether payment service providers and other intermediaries could be deemed to be the legal agent of merchants for certain tax purposes. We have modified our systems to meet applicable requirements and expect that further modifications will be required to comply with future requirements, which may negatively impact our customer experience and increase operational costs. Any failure by us to comply with these and similar reporting and record-keeping obligations could result in substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions, adversely impact our ability to do business in certain jurisdictions, and harm our business. We may be unable to attract, retain, and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our business. Competition for key and other highly skilled personnel is intense, especially for executive talent, software engineers, and other technology talent. We may be limited in our ability to recruit or hire internationally, including due to restrictive laws or policies on immigration, travel, or availability of visas for skilled workers. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel, or our inability to attract, hire, develop, motivate and retain key and other highly qualified and diverse talent, whether in a remote or in-office environment, or address the safety, health and productivity of our workforce could harm our overall business and results of operations. We are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our products and services. We may be subject to claims relating to information disseminated through our online services, including claims alleging defamation, libel, harassment, hate speech, breach of contract, invasion of privacy, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through the services, among other things. We invest in measures intended to detect and block activities that may occur within our payments platform in violation of our policies. These measures require continuous improvement and may not be effective in detecting and preventing the exchange of information in violation of our policies. If these measures are not effective, our business could be negatively impacted. If the laws or regulations that provide protections for online dissemination of information are invalidated or are modified to reduce protections available to us and we become liable for information provided by our customers and carried on our products and services, we could be directly harmed and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure, including expending substantial resources or discontinuing certain product or service offerings, which could harm our business. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS 30 You should carefully review this section in addition to the other information appearing in this Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, for important information regarding risks and uncertainties that affect us. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business.

    "context": "OVERVIEW PayPal Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in January 2015 and is a leading technology platform and digital payments company that enables digital and mobile payments on behalf of merchants and consumers worldwide. PayPal is committed to democratizing financial services to improve the financial health of individuals and to increase economic opportunity for entrepreneurs and businesses of all sizes around the world. Our goal is to enable our merchants and consumers to manage and move their money anywhere in the world, anytime, on any platform, and using any device when sending payments or getting paid. We also facilitate person-to-person (“P2P”) payments through our PayPal, Venmo, and Xoom products and services and simplify and personalize shopping experiences for our consumers through our Honey Platform. Our combined payment solutions, including our core PayPal, PayPal Credit, Braintree, Venmo, Xoom, iZettle, and Hyperwallet products and services, comprise our proprietary Payments Platform. Unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires, references to “we,” “our,” “us,” “the Company,” or “PayPal” refer to PayPal Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.PayPal’s payment solutions enable our customers to send and receive payments. We operate a global, two-sided network at scale that connects merchants and consumers with 377 million active accounts (consisting of 348 million consumer active accounts and 29 million merchant active accounts) across more than 200 markets. PayPal helps merchants and consumers connect, transact, and complete payments, whether they are online, on a mobile device, in an app, or in person. PayPal is more than a connection to third-party payment networks. We provide proprietary payment solutions accepted by merchants that enable the completion of payments on our Payments Platform on behalf of our customers. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted consumer behavior and has accelerated the shift from traditional in-store shopping toward e-commerce and buy online and pick up in store to the extent that merchants are adopting safer contactless payment solutions based on consumer demand for such options.We offer our customers the flexibility to use their accounts to purchase and receive payments for goods and services, as well as the ability to transfer and withdraw funds. We enable consumers to exchange funds more safely with merchants using a variety of funding sources, which may include a bank account, a PayPal Cash or Cash Plus account balance, a Venmo account balance, our credit products, a credit card, debit card, or other stored value products such as coupons, gift cards, and eligible credit card rewards. Our PayPal, Venmo, and Xoom products also make it safer and simpler for friends and family to transfer funds to each other. We offer merchants an end-to-end payments solution that provides authorization and settlement capabilities, as well as instant access to funds. We help merchants connect with their customers and manage risk. We enable consumers to engage in cross-border shopping and merchants to extend their global reach while reducing the complexity and friction involved in enabling overseas and cross-border trade. 4 We earn revenues primarily by charging fees for completing payment transactions for our customers and other payment-related services that are typically based on the volume of activity processed on our Payments Platform. We generally do not charge consumers to fund or draw from their accounts; however, we generate revenue from consumers on fees charged for foreign currency conversion and instant transfers from their PayPal or Venmo account to their debit card or bank account, as well as from interest and fees from our credit products. We also earn revenue by providing other value added services, which comprise revenue earned through partnerships, our merchant and consumer credit products, referral fees, subscription fees, gateway services, and other services that we provide to our merchants and consumers. KEY PERFORMANCE METRICS We measure the relevance of our products and services to our customers and the performance and success of our business through active accounts, payment transactions, and total payment volume:An Active Account is an account registered directly with PayPal or a platform access partner that has completed a transaction on our Payments Platform or through our Honey Platform, not including gateway-exclusive transactions, within the past 12 months. A platform access partner is a third party whose customers are provided access to PayPal’s Payments Platform through such third-party’s login credentials. Number of Payment Transactions are the total number of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our Payments Platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions.Total Payment Volume (“TPV”) is the value of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our Payments Platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions. OUR STRENGTHS Our business is built on a strong foundation designed to drive growth and differentiate us from our competitors. We believe that our competitive strengths include the following:•Two-sided network—our Payments Platform connecting merchants and consumers enables PayPal to offer unique end-to-end product experiences while gaining valuable insights into customer behavior. Our Payments Platform provides for digital, mobile, and in-store (at the point of sale) transactions while being both technology and platform agnostic. 5 •Scale—our global scale allows us to drive organic growth. As of December 31, 2020, we had 377 million active accounts, consisting of 348 million consumer active accounts and 29 million merchant active accounts in more than 200 markets around the world. A market is a geographic area or political jurisdiction, such as a country, territory, or protectorate, in which we offer some or all of our products and services. A country, territory, or protectorate is identified by a distinct set of laws and regulations. In 2020, we processed $936 billion of TPV.•Brands—we have built and strengthened well-recognized and trusted brands, including PayPal, Braintree, Venmo, Xoom, Hyperwallet, iZettle, and Honey. Our marketing efforts across multiple demographic groups play an important role in building brand visibility, usage, and overall preference among customers. •Risk and Compliance Management—our enterprise risk and compliance management program and use of tokenization are designed to help keep customer information secure, and to help ensure we process legitimate transactions around the world, while identifying and minimizing illegal, high-risk, or fraudulent transactions.•Regulatory—we believe that our regulatory licenses, which enable us to operate in markets around the world, are a distinct advantage and help support business growth. MERCHANT AND CONSUMER PAYMENT SOLUTIONS Merchant Value Proposition We partner with our merchants to help grow and expand their businesses by providing global reach and powering all aspects of digital checkout. We offer alternative payment methods, including access to credit solutions, provide fraud prevention and risk management solutions, reduce losses through proprietary protection programs, and offer tools and insights for leveraging data analytics to attract new customers and improve sales conversion. We employ a technology and platform agnostic approach intended to enable merchants of all sizes to quickly and easily provide digital checkout online, on mobile devices, and in-store across all platforms and devices and to securely and simply receive payments from their customers. 6 PayPal’s Payments Platform enables merchants to accept all types of online and offline payments, including those made with the PayPal and Venmo wallets, credit cards and debit cards, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, and Google Pay, as well as other popular local payment methods. Our diversified product suite is tailored to meet the needs of merchants regardless of their size or business complexity. We have expanded our merchant value proposition to enable payment acceptance at the point of sale through our PayPal and Venmo digital wallets, our iZettle point of sale solutions, and our quick response (“QR”) code-based solutions. We aim to offer a seamless, omni-channel solution that helps merchants manage and grow their business. Our Honey Platform and PayPal consumer credit offerings, including installment payment products, enable merchants to drive increased conversion through higher consumer engagement.We offer access to credit products for certain small and medium-sized merchants through our PayPal Working Capital and PayPal Business Loan products, which we collectively refer to as our merchant lending offerings. Our PayPal Working Capital product allows businesses to borrow a certain percentage of their annual payment volume processed by PayPal for a fixed fee. Our PayPal Business Loan product provides businesses with short-term financing for a fixed fee based on an evaluation of both the applying business as well as the business owner. We believe that our merchant lending offerings allow us to deepen our engagement with our existing small and medium-sized merchants and expand services to new merchants by providing access to capital that may not be available effectively or efficiently from traditional banks or other lending providers. Our acquisition of a controlling equity interest in Guofubao Information Technology Co. (GoPay), Ltd (“GoPay”), a holder of payment business licenses in China, enables us to partner with Chinese financial institutions and technology platforms to provide a more comprehensive set of payment solutions to merchants and consumers, both in China and globally.We generate revenues from merchants primarily by charging fees for completing their payment transactions and other payment-related services. Consumer Value Proposition We focus on providing affordable consumer products intended to democratize the management and movement of money. We provide consumers with a digital wallet that enables them to send payments to merchants more safely using a variety of funding sources, which may include a bank account, a PayPal Cash or Cash Plus account balance, a Venmo account balance, our consumer credit products, a credit card, debit card, or other stored value products such as coupons, gift cards, and eligible credit card rewards. We also offer consumers P2P payment solutions through our PayPal, Venmo, and Xoom products and services. We enable both domestic and international P2P transfers across our Payments Platform. Our Venmo app in the U.S. is a leading mobile application used to move money between our customers and to make purchases at select merchants. Xoom is an international money transfer service that enables our customers to send money and prepaid mobile phone reloads to, and pay bills for, people around the world in a secure, fast, and cost-effective way. P2P is a significant customer acquisition channel that facilitates organic growth by enabling potential PayPal users to establish active accounts with us at the time they make or receive a P2P payment. We also simplify and personalize shopping experiences for our consumers through our Honey Platform by offering tools for product discovery, price-tracking, and offers, which enhances consumer engagement and conversion and sales for our merchants.We offer our PayPal Credit products to consumers in certain markets as a potential funding source at checkout. Once a consumer is approved for credit, PayPal Credit is made available as a funding source for that account holder. Our U.S. PayPal- and Venmo-branded consumer credit program is offered primarily through Synchrony Bank. In addition, we have expanded our consumer credit offerings to include installment payment products in the U.S., U.K., France, and Germany. We believe that our consumer credit products allow us to increase engagement with consumers and merchants on our two-sided network. We generate revenue from consumers on fees charged for foreign currency conversion, optional instant transfers from their PayPal or Venmo account to their debit card or bank account, interest and fees from our PayPal Credit products, and other miscellaneous fees. 7 PROTECTING MERCHANTS AND CONSUMERS Protecting merchants and consumers on our Payments Platform from financial and fraud loss is imperative to successfully competing and sustainably growing our business. Fraudulent activities, such as account takeover, identity theft (including stolen financial information), and counterparty malicious activities, represent a significant risk to merchants and consumers, as well as their payment partners. We provide merchants and consumers with protection programs for certain purchase transactions completed on our Payments Platform. We believe that these programs, which help protect both merchants and consumers from financial loss resulting from fraud and counterparty non-performance, are generally broader than similar protections provided by other participants in the payments industry. As a result, merchants may incur losses for chargebacks and other claims on certain transactions when using other payments providers that the merchants would not incur if they used our payments services. We also provide consumer protection against losses on qualifying purchases and accept claims for review up to 180 days post-transaction. We believe that this protection is generally consistent with, or better than, that offered by other payments providers. These programs are designed to promote confidence on both the part of consumers, who will only be required to pay if they receive their purchased item in the condition significantly as described, and merchants, who will receive payment for the product they deliver to the customer.Our ability to protect both merchants and consumers is based largely on our proprietary, end-to-end Payments Platform and our ability to utilize the data from both sides of transactions on our two-sided network, specifically from buyers and sellers and from senders and receivers of payments. We believe mobile devices will continue to play a significant and increasing role in commerce, including by creating the opportunities to make the payments ecosystem safer. For example, PayPal uses data from mobile devices to help reduce financial and fraud risk to merchants and consumers. Our ongoing investment in systems and processes designed to enhance the safety and security of our products reflects our goal of having PayPal recognized as one of the world’s most trusted payments brands. COMPETITION The global payments industry is highly competitive, continuously changing, highly innovative, and increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny and oversight. We compete against a wide range of businesses. Some of our current and potential competitors may be larger than we are, have larger customer bases, greater brand recognition, longer operating histories, a dominant or more secure position, broader geographic scope, volume, scale, resources, and market share than we do, or offer products and services that we do not offer. Other competitors are smaller or younger companies that may be more agile in responding quickly to regulatory and technological changes. Many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with innovative and disruptive technologies, emerging competitors, business alliances, shifting consumer habits and user needs, price sensitivity on the part of merchants and consumers, and frequent introductions of new products and services.We differentiate ourselves to merchants through our ability to innovate and develop products and services that offer new payment experiences for our merchants, demonstrate that they may achieve incremental sales by using and offering our services to consumers, support transactions on our Payments Platform across varied technologies and payment methods, through the simplicity and transparency of our fee structure, and our seller protection programs. In addition, we differentiate ourselves to consumers through the ability to use our products and services across multiple commerce channels, including e-commerce, mobile, and payments at the point of sale, and without sharing their financial information with the merchant or any other party they are paying; our customer service, dispute resolution, and buyer protection programs; and our ability to simplify and personalize shopping experiences. We believe that we compare favorably to our competitors with respect to these factors and we invest resources towards improving our products and services, offering choice in payment options, providing excellent customer service, and building brands that merchants and consumers trust.Our business faces competition from a wide range of businesses and from all forms of physical and electronic payments. We face competition from banks and financial institutions, which provide traditional payment methods (particularly credit cards and debit cards (collectively, “payment cards”), electronic bank transfers, and credit), payment networks that facilitate payments for payment cards or proprietary retail networks, payment card processors, and “card on file” services. We also face competition from providers offering a variety of payment products and services including tokenized and contactless payment cards, digital wallets and mobile payments solutions, credit, installment or other buy now pay later methods, real-time payment systems, P2P payments and money remittance services, card readers and other devices or technologies for payment at point of sale, virtual currencies and distributed ledger technologies, and tools that simplify and personalize shopping experiences for consumers and merchants. Our products and services face competition from all forms of payments, which include paper-based payments (primarily cash and checks), credit cards, debit cards, electronic bank transfers, credit, installment methods, digital wallets and mobile payment solutions, contactless payments (including contactless cards, tokenized cards, near field communication (“NFC”) based solutions, and QR code-based solutions), and virtual currencies, such as cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. 8 In addition to the discussion in this section, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” under the caption “We face substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry” for further discussion of the potential impact of competition on our business. STRATEGY Our ability to grow revenue is affected by, among other things, consumer spending patterns, merchant and consumer adoption of digital payment methods, the expansion of multiple commerce channels, the growth of mobile devices and merchant and consumer applications on those devices, the growth of consumers globally with internet and mobile access, the pace of transition from cash and checks to digital forms of payment, our share of the digital payments market, and our ability to innovate and introduce new products and services that merchants and consumers value. Our strategy to drive growth in our business includes the following:•Growing our core business: through expanding our global capabilities, customer base and scale, increasing our customers’ use of our products and services by better addressing their everyday needs related to accessing, managing, and moving money, and expanding the adoption of our solutions by merchants and consumers;•Expanding our value proposition for merchants and consumers: by being technology and platform agnostic, partnering with our merchants to grow and expand their business online and in-store, and providing consumers with simple, secure, and flexible ways to manage and move money across different markets, merchants, and platforms; •Forming strategic partnerships: by building new strategic partnerships to provide better experiences for our customers, offering greater choice and flexibility, acquiring new customers, and reinforcing our role in the payments ecosystem; and•Seeking new areas of growth: organically and through acquisitions and strategic investments in our existing and new international markets around the world and focusing on innovation both in the digital and physical world.In 2021, we intend to further enhance our PayPal and Venmo digital wallets to increase their functionality and drive higher engagement on our Payments Platform. Our goal is to provide our consumers with a comprehensive set of services to manage their finances and enhance their ability to shop online and in person. TECHNOLOGY Our Payments Platform utilizes a combination of proprietary and third-party technologies and services intended to efficiently and securely facilitate transactions between millions of merchants and consumers worldwide across different channels, markets, and networks. Our Payments Platform connects with financial service providers around the world and allows consumers to make purchases using a wide range of payment methods, regardless of where a merchant is located. Consumers who use our Payments Platform can send payments in more than 200 markets around the world and in more than 100 currencies, withdraw funds to their bank accounts in 56 currencies, and hold balances in their PayPal accounts in 25 currencies. A transaction on our Payments Platform can involve multiple participants in addition to us, including a merchant, a consumer, and the consumer’s funding source provider. We have developed intuitive user interfaces, customer tools, transaction completion database, and network applications on our Payments Platform designed to enable our customers to utilize our suite of products and services. Our Payments Platform, open application programming interfaces, and developer tools are designed to enable developers to innovate with ease and offer robust applications to our global ecosystem of merchants and consumers, while at the same time maintaining the security of our customers’ information. The technology infrastructure supporting our Payments Platform simplifies the storage and processing of large amounts of data and facilitates the deployment and operation of large-scale global products and services in both our own data centers and when hosted by third party cloud service providers. Our technology infrastructure is designed around industry best practices intended to reduce downtime and help ensure the resiliency of our Payments Platform in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences. Our Payments Platform incorporates multiple layers of protection for business continuity and system redundancy purposes and to help mitigate cybersecurity risks. We have a comprehensive cybersecurity program designed to protect our technology infrastructure and Payments Platform against cybersecurity threats, which includes regularly testing of our systems to identify and address potential vulnerabilities. We strive to continually improve our technology infrastructure and Payments Platform to enhance the customer experience and to increase efficiency, scalability, and security. 9 For additional information regarding risks relating to our technology infrastructure and cybersecurity, see the information in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” under the captions “Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to our reputation, business, and financial condition” and “Business interruptions or systems failures may impair the availability of our websites, applications, products or services, or otherwise harm our business.” RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Total research and development expense was $1.4 billion in 2020 and $1.1 billion in both 2019 and 2018. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY The protection of our intellectual property, including our trademarks, patents, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, and trade secrets, is important to the success of our business. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on applicable laws and regulations in the U.S. and internationally, as well as a variety of administrative procedures. We have registered our core brands as domain names and as trademarks in the U.S. and a large number of international jurisdictions. We also have an active program to continue to secure and enforce trademarks and domain names that corresponds to our brands in markets of interest. We have filed patent applications in the U.S. and in international jurisdictions covering certain aspects of our proprietary technology and new innovations. We also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights when offering or procuring products and services. We have routinely entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and non-disclosure agreements with parties with whom we conduct business to control access to, and use and disclosure of, our proprietary information.For additional information regarding risks relating to our intellectual property, see the information in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” under the captions “Third parties may allege that we are infringing their patents and other intellectual property rights\" and “We may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights.” GOVERNMENT REGULATION We operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened focus by regulators globally on all aspects of the payments industry, including countering terrorist financing, anti-money laundering, privacy, cybersecurity, and consumer protection. The laws and regulations applicable to us, including those enacted prior to the advent of digital and mobile payments, are continuing to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation. New or changing laws and regulations, including changes to their interpretation or implementation, as well as increased penalties and enforcement actions related to non-compliance, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We monitor these areas closely and are focused on designing compliant solutions for our customers.Government regulation impacts key aspects of our business. We are subject to regulations that affect the payments industry in the markets we operate.Payments Regulation. Various laws and regulations govern the payments industry in the U.S. and internationally. In the U.S., PayPal, Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary) holds licenses to operate as a money transmitter (or its equivalent) in the states where such licenses are required, as well as in the District of Columbia and certain territories. These licenses include not only the PayPal branded products and services offered in these locations, but also our Venmo, Hyperwallet and Xoom products and services to the extent offered in these locations. As a licensed money transmitter, PayPal is subject to, among other requirements, restrictions with respect to the investment of customer funds, reporting requirements, bonding requirements, and inspection by state regulatory agencies. In certain cases, these licenses also generally cover PayPal’s service enabling customers to buy, hold, and sell cryptocurrency directly from their PayPal account, which is currently available only in the U.S. In the State of New York, PayPal has obtained a conditional virtual currency license from the New York Department of Financial Services to offer cryptocurrency services in the state in partnership with Paxos Trust Company. Outside the U.S., we provide similar services customized for various countries and foreign jurisdictions through our foreign subsidiaries. The activities of those non-U.S. entities are, or may be, supervised by a financial regulatory authority in the jurisdictions in which they operate. Among other regulatory authorities, the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (the “CSSF”), the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, the People’s Bank of China, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Reserve Bank of India, the Central Bank of Russia, and the Central Bank of Brazil have asserted jurisdiction over some or all of our activities in their respective jurisdictions. This list is not exhaustive, and there are numerous other regulatory agencies that have or may assert jurisdiction over our activities. The laws and regulations applicable to the payments industry in any given jurisdiction are subject to interpretation and change. 10 In addition, financial services regulators in various jurisdictions, including the U.S. and the European Union (“EU”), have implemented authentication requirements for banks and payment processors intended to reduce online fraud, which could impose significant costs, make it more difficult for new customers to join PayPal, and reduce the ease of use of our products.Banking Agency Supervision. We serve our customers in the EU through PayPal (Europe) S.à.r.l. et Cie, SCA, a wholly-owned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a bank in Luxembourg by the CSSF. Consequently, we must comply with rules and regulations of the European banking industry, including those related to capitalization, funds management, corporate governance, anti-money laundering, disclosure, reporting, and inspection. We are, or may be, subject to banking-related regulations in other countries now or in the future related to our role in the financial industry. In addition, based on our relationships with our partner financial institutions, we are, or may be, subject to indirect regulation and examination by these financial institutions’ regulators.Lending Regulation. PayPal’s U.S. consumer short-term installment loan product is subject to state lending laws (some of which require licensure and/or state regulator notification), state collection laws, as well as compliance with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B as implemented by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) and other applicable laws and regulations.Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The CFPB has significant authority to regulate consumer financial products in the U.S., including consumer credit, deposits, payments, and similar products. As a large market participant of remittance transfers, the CFPB has direct supervisory authority over our business. The CFPB and similar regulatory agencies in other jurisdictions may have broad consumer protection mandates that could result in the promulgation and interpretation of rules and regulations that may affect our business. Anti-Money Laundering, Counter-Terrorist Financing, and Sanctions. PayPal is subject to anti-money laundering (“AML”) laws and regulations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, as well as laws designed to prevent the use of the financial systems to facilitate terrorist activities. Our AML program is designed to prevent our Payments Platform from being used to facilitate money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit activities, or to do business in countries or with persons and entities included on designated country or person lists promulgated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls (“OFAC”) and equivalent authorities in other countries. Our AML and sanctions compliance programs, overseen by our AML/Bank Secrecy Act Officer, is composed of policies, procedures, and internal controls, and is designed to address these legal and regulatory requirements and assist in managing money laundering and terrorist financing risks.Interchange Fees. Interchange fees associated with four-party payments systems are being reviewed or challenged in various jurisdictions. For example, in the EU, the Multilateral Interchange Fee (“MIF”) Regulation caps interchange fees for credit and debit card payments and provides for business rules to be complied with by any company dealing with payment card transactions, including PayPal. As a result, the fees that we collect in certain jurisdictions may become the subject of regulatory challenge.Data Protection and Information Security. We are subject to a number of laws, rules, directives, and regulations (“privacy and data protection laws”) relating to the collection, use, retention, security, processing, and transfer (collectively, “processing”) of personally identifiable information about our customers, our merchants’ customers, and employees (“personal data”) in the countries where we operate. Our business relies on the processing of personal data in many jurisdictions and the movement of data across national borders. As a result, much of the personal data that we process, which may include certain financial information associated with individuals, is subject to one or more privacy and data protection laws in one or more jurisdictions. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between or among us, our subsidiaries, and other parties with which we have commercial relationships. The EU has adopted a comprehensive General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), which came into effect in May 2018. GDPR expanded the scope of the EU data protection law to foreign companies processing personal data of European Economic Area (“EEA”) individuals and imposed a stricter data protection compliance regime. In the U.S., we are subject to privacy and information safeguarding requirements under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act as well as the California Consumer Privacy Act, which requires privacy protections comparable to those afforded by the GDPR, as well as the maintenance of a written, comprehensive information security program. In Europe, the operations of our Luxembourg bank are subject to confidentiality and information safeguarding requirements under the Luxembourg Banking Act. 11 PayPal relies on a variety of compliance methods to transfer personal data of EEA individuals to the U.S., including reliance on Binding Corporate Rules (“BCRs”) for internal transfers of certain types of personal data and Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”). PayPal must also ensure that third parties processing personal data of PayPal’s EEA customers and/or employees outside of the EEA have compliant transfer mechanisms. In July 2020, the European Court of Justice (“ECJ”) invalidated the U.S.-EU Privacy Shield - safe harbor framework that was previously relied upon by some PayPal vendors, and PayPal entered into SCCs with those third parties. PayPal did not certify under the Privacy Shield regime and continues to use SCCs and BCRs as the primary cross border data transfer mechanisms. However, the ECJ ruling made clear that these transfer mechanisms will be subject to additional scrutiny as well. To the extent PayPal relies on SCCs, or any third party relies on the Privacy Shield regime for the compliant transfer of personal data, PayPal’s ability to process EEA personal data to such parties could be jeopardized.Regulatory scrutiny of privacy, data protection, cybersecurity practices, and the processing of personal data is increasing around the world. Regulatory authorities are continuously considering numerous legislative and regulatory proposals and interpretive guidelines that may contain additional privacy and data protection obligations. In addition, the interpretation and application of these privacy and data protection laws in the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere are often uncertain and in a state of flux.Anti-Corruption. PayPal is subject to applicable anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Anti-corruption laws generally prohibit offering, promising, giving, accepting, or authorizing others to provide anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to or from a government official or private party in order to influence official action or otherwise gain an unfair business advantage, such as to obtain or retain business. We have implemented policies, procedures, and internal controls that are designed to comply with these laws and regulations.Additional Regulatory Developments. Various regulatory agencies continue to examine and implement laws governing a wide variety of issues, including virtual currencies, identity theft, account management guidelines, disclosure rules, cybersecurity, and marketing, which may impact PayPal’s business.For an additional discussion on governmental regulation affecting our business, please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” included in this Form 10-K. HUMAN CAPITAL Global Talent Management At PayPal, we consider the management of our global talent (human capital) to be essential to the ongoing success of our business. As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 26,500 people globally, representing approximately 150 nationalities, located in more than 30 countries, including approximately 12,300 located in the U.S. Attracting, recruiting, developing, and retaining diverse talent enables us to provide our customers with products and services that help them to thrive in the global economy, and serve our stakeholders. We are focused on supporting our employees across the full employee lifecycle from recruitment to onboarding to development, and have implemented programs designed to promote their total wellness, particularly during difficult times such as the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, in 2020, we enhanced our Crisis Leave Program, provided flexible work arrangements, and adjusted our benefits to include additional mental health support. Employee Engagement We use employee feedback to directly inform the ongoing development of our employee programs. In addition to administering an annual survey to gather input from our global workforce, we conducted regular wellness surveys throughout the COVID-19 pandemic to get real-time feedback from our employees. For our 2020 annual employee survey, we heard from 85% of our global employees. Our engagement score, which reflects employees that would recommend PayPal to their peers and/or are happy at PayPal was 84%, representing a four percentage point increase compared to 2019. In 2020, we continued to enhance our employee programs based on results from our 2019 survey and other employee input. For example, we established in-person feedback sessions to improve efficiencies, enhanced employee communication strategies, and launched additional learning and development programs. We also evaluate employee survey responses for feedback on other key components of our culture and programs. The detailed scores are shared across the organization and analyzed to understand differences by geography, demographics, and job level, and to identify opportunities for further improvement. 12 Talent Acquisition and Development As a leading technology platform and digital payments company, we compete for top global talent around the world. We believe that a strong culture focused on employee experiences that enables advancement, learning, and individual career insights is essential to the successful acquisition, retention, and development of diverse talent. To that end, we have implemented programs focused on inclusive hiring practices, enriched virtual new hire experiences, individual coaching, and mentorship programs, and provided ongoing learning opportunities, including unlimited access to LinkedIn Learning. Employee Wellness We remain focused on promoting the total wellness of our employees, including resources, programs and services to support our employees’ physical, mental, and financial wellness. As part of our integrated approach to benefits, we have made strengthening employee financial wellness a strategic priority at PayPal. In late 2019, we designed an inclusive program that raised wages (where appropriate), lowered the cost of U.S. healthcare benefits for hourly-wage earners, offered new financial tools and resources, and granted equity or equity-based awards to all employees of the company, subject to legal limitations. We continue to extend this initiative and recently added resources for employees to improve their cash flow through access to early earned wages and modified retirement programs in select global markets. Diversity, Inclusion, Equity, and Belonging Our focus on fostering diversity, inclusion, equity, and belonging (“DIEB”) is critical to our global talent strategy and pivotal to building a culture that embraces individual characteristics, values diversity, minimizes barriers, and enhances feelings of security and support across the workplace. We are committed to equal pay for equal work, promoting enterprise-wide inclusive learning opportunities, and partnering with leading organizations to embed DIEB considerations into our talent strategy. We empower eight employee resource groups to promote community and authenticity for employees that identify as Black, Latinx, women, interfaith, veterans, LGBTQ+, Asian, and disabled persons. These groups drive ongoing employee engagement around the world for all employees, regardless of background, to support and champion their peers and related causes. In 2020, we also announced a targeted commitment to support Black- and minority-owned businesses, and underrepresented communities and employees, including additional financial commitments to enhance our employee resource groups, cultivate diverse talent pipelines, and create inclusive onboarding and skill building opportunities. As part of our annual environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) reporting, we provide additional information on our global talent strategy, including detailed representation metrics, in our Global Impact Report available at https://investor.pypl.com/esg-strategy/default.aspx.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS You should carefully review this section in addition to the other information appearing in this Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, for important information regarding risks and uncertainties that affect us. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. 13 CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC RISKS The novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. There are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect that the spread of COVID-19 as a global pandemic may have. The ultimate extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, financial condition, and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, difficult to predict, and subject to change, including, but not limited to, the duration, scope, severity, and geographic spread of the outbreak, its impact on the global economy, actions taken to contain or limit the impact of COVID-19, such as the availability of an effective vaccine or treatment, geographic variation in how countries and states are handling the pandemic, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions may potentially resume.The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted and is likely to further adversely impact the operations of our customers, suppliers, vendors and other business partners, and may adversely impact our results of operations in the future. Cross-border and domestic commerce may be adversely impacted by measures taken by government authorities and businesses globally to contain and limit the outbreak’s spread, including travel restrictions, border closures, quarantines, shelter in place and lock down orders, mask and social distancing requirements, and business limitations and shutdowns. To the extent that such mitigation measures remain in place or are reinstated for significant periods of time, they may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Actions that we have taken or may take in the future intended to assist customers impacted by COVID-19 may negatively impact our results of operations. In particular, we have experienced and may continue to experience adverse financial impacts from a number of operational factors, including, but not limited to:•Merchants selling goods or services in advance of the date of their delivery (e.g., travel and events verticals) or experiencing bankruptcy, insolvency, business failure, or other business interruption, which could result in our becoming liable to the buyers of such goods or services through our buyer protection program or through chargebacks on payment cards used by customers to fund their payments;•Merchants who utilize PayPal branded merchant credit products such as PayPal Working Capital and PayPal Business Loan products or consumers who utilize PayPal branded consumer credit products defaulting on their payment obligations;•Increased cybersecurity and payment fraud risk related to COVID-19, as cybercriminals attempt to profit from the disruption in light of increased online banking, e-commerce, and other online activity;•Challenges to the availability and reliability of our products and services resulting from changes to our normal operations, including due to one or more clusters of COVID-19 cases occurring at our (or our service providers’) sites or mandatory local lock-down requirements, which may impact our employees, our level of customer service, and/or the systems or employees of our customers and business partners; and•An increased volume of customer requests for support and regulatory requests for information and support or additional regulatory requirements, which could require additional resources and costs to address.Additionally, COVID-19 has negatively impacted the financial viability and operations of merchants in certain verticals (such as travel and events) and, as a result, allowances for transaction and credit losses may not accurately reflect the amount of losses that PayPal may be exposed to by these merchants. Further, we may not have the ability to accurately forecast the magnitude of such losses or any additional merchant segments that could be adversely impacted by COVID-19.Our business has benefited from the shift from in-store shopping and traditional payment methods towards e-commerce and digital payments, including a significant increase in net new active accounts and payments volume. To the extent that customer preferences revert to pre-COVID-19 behaviors as mitigation measures to limit the spread of COVID-19 are lifted or relaxed and an effective vaccine or treatments for COVID-19 becomes available, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely impacted. The significant increase in the number of our employees who are working remotely as a result of the pandemic, and an extended period of remote work arrangements and subsequent reintroduction into the workplace could introduce operational risk, increase cybersecurity risk, strain our business continuity plans, negatively impact productivity, and give rise to claims by employees or otherwise adversely affect our business. Additionally, COVID-19 could require new or modified processes, procedures, and controls to respond to changes in our business environment. We may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, and business partners. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by COVID-19 or will otherwise be satisfactory to government authorities. 14 The impacts of COVID-19, individually or collectively, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and have the effect of heightening or exacerbating many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section. CYBERSECURITY AND TECHNOLOGY RISKS Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to our reputation, business, and financial condition. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized, improper, or illegal access to systems and information (including customers’ personal data), disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems are constantly evolving, and often are not recognized or detected until after they have been launched against a target. Unauthorized parties have attempted, and we expect that they will continue to attempt, to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means, including, but not limited to, hacking into our systems or facilities or those of our customers, partners, or vendors, and attempting to fraudulently induce users of our systems (including employees and customers) into disclosing user names, passwords, payment card information, or other sensitive information. This information may in turn be used to access our customers’ personal or proprietary information and payment card data that are stored on or accessible through our information technology systems and those of third parties with whom we partner. Numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats, including advanced and persisting cyberattacks, cyberextortion, spear phishing and social engineering schemes, the introduction of computer viruses or other malware, and the physical destruction of all or portions of our information technology and infrastructure and those of third parties with whom we partner could compromise the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the data in our systems. We have experienced from time to time, and may experience in the future, breaches of our security measures due to human error, malfeasance, insider threats, system errors or vulnerabilities, or other irregularities. We believe that PayPal is a particularly attractive target due to our name and brand recognition and the widespread adoption and use of our products and services. Any cyberattacks or data security breaches affecting the information technology or infrastructure of companies we acquire or of our customers, partners, or vendors (including data center and cloud computing providers) could have similar negative effects. For example, in November 2017, we suspended the operations of TIO Networks (“TIO”) (acquired in July 2017) as part of an investigation of security vulnerabilities of the TIO platform. In December 2017, we announced that we had identified evidence of unauthorized access to TIO’s network and the potential compromise of personally identifiable information for approximately 1.6 million TIO customers. This incident resulted in governmental inquiries and civil claims against us and may lead to additional inquiries and claims in the future. Under payment card network rules and our contracts with our payment processors, if there is a breach of payment card information that we store, or that is stored by our direct payment card processing vendors, we could be liable to the payment card issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses. Cybersecurity breaches and security vulnerabilities could subject us to significant costs and liabilities, result in improper disclosure of data and violations of applicable privacy and other laws, require us to change our business practices, cause us to incur significant remediation costs, lead to loss of customer confidence in, or decreased use of, our products and services, damage our reputation and brands, divert the attention of management from the operation of our business, or result in significant compensation or contractual penalties from us to our customers and their business partners as a result of losses to or claims by them. While we maintain insurance policies, our coverage may be insufficient to compensate us for all losses caused by security breaches. Business interruptions or systems failures may impair the availability of our websites, applications, products or services, or otherwise harm our business. Our systems and operations and those of our service providers and partners have experienced from time to time, and may experience in the future business interruptions or degradation because of distributed denial-of-service and other cyberattacks, insider threats, hardware and software defects or malfunctions, human error, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, and other natural disasters, public health crises (including pandemics), power losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist attacks, computer viruses or other malware, or other events. Our corporate headquarters are located in the Silicon Valley, a seismically active region in California. A catastrophic event that results in a disruption or failure of our systems or operations could result in significant losses and require substantial recovery time and significant expenditures to resume or maintain operations, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Additionally, some of our systems, including those of companies we have acquired, are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all possible outcomes or events. As a provider of payments solutions, we are subject to heightened scrutiny by regulators that may require specific business continuity, resiliency and disaster recovery plans, and rigorous testing of such plans, which may be costly and time-consuming to implement, and may divert our resources from other business priorities. 15 We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience system failures, denial-of-service attacks, and other events or conditions from time to time that interrupt the availability, or reduce or adversely affect the speed or functionality, of our products and services. These events have resulted and likely will continue to result in loss of revenue. A prolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in the availability, speed, or functionality of our products and services could materially harm our business. Frequent or persistent interruptions in our services could permanently harm our relationship with our customers and partners and our reputation. Moreover, if any system failure or similar event results in damages to our customers or their business partners, these customers or partners could seek significant compensation or contractual penalties from us for their losses, and those claims, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and costly for us to address, and could have other consequences described in this “Risk Factors” section under the caption “Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to our reputation, business, and financial condition.” Our Payments Platform has experienced and may in the future experience intermittent unavailability. We have undertaken and continue to undertake certain system upgrades and re-platforming efforts designed to improve our reliability, resiliency, and speed. These efforts are costly and time-consuming, involve significant technical risk, and may divert our resources from new features and products, and there can be no guarantee that these efforts will succeed. Frequent or persistent site interruptions could lead to regulatory scrutiny, significant fines and penalties, and mandatory and costly changes to our business practices, and ultimately could cause us to lose existing licenses that we need to operate or prevent or delay us from obtaining additional licenses that may be required for our business.We also rely on facilities, components, applications, and services supplied by third parties, including data center facilities and cloud storage services. From time to time, such third parties have ceased to provide us with such facilities and services. If these third parties experience operational interference or disruptions (including a cybersecurity incident), breach their agreements with us, or fail to perform their obligations and meet our expectations, our operations could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected, which could result in customer dissatisfaction, regulatory scrutiny, and damage to our reputation and brands, and materially and adversely affect our business. While we maintain business interruption insurance, it may not be sufficient to reimburse us for losses caused by interruptions in our service as a result of systems failures and similar events.In addition, any failure to successfully implement new information systems and technologies, or improvements or upgrades to existing information systems and technologies in a timely manner could have an adverse impact on our business, internal controls (including internal controls over financial reporting), results of operations, and financial condition. If we cannot keep pace with rapid technological developments to provide new and innovative products and services, the use of our products and services and, consequently, our revenues, could decline. Rapid, significant, and disruptive technological changes impact the industries in which we operate, for example, payment technologies (including real-time payments, payment card tokenization, virtual currencies, distributed ledger and blockchain technologies, and proximity payment technology such as NFC and other contactless payments); internet browser technologies, that enable users to easily store their payment card information for use on any retail or e-commerce website; artificial intelligence and machine learning; developments in technologies supporting our regulatory and compliance obligations; and in-store, digital, mobile, and social commerce.We expect new services and technologies to continue to emerge and evolve, and we cannot predict the effects of technological changes on our business. We rely in part on third parties, including some of our competitors, for the development of and access to new or evolving technologies. These third parties may restrict or prevent our access to, or utilization of, those technologies, as well as their platforms or products. We may not be able to accurately predict which technological developments or innovations will become widely adopted and how those technologies may be regulated. We expect that new services and technologies applicable to the industries in which we operate will continue to emerge and may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies we currently use in our products and services. Developing and incorporating new technologies into our products and services may require significant investment, take considerable time, and ultimately may not be successful. Our ability to adopt new products and services and to develop new technologies may be limited or restricted by industry-wide standards, platform providers, payments networks, changes to laws and regulations, changing expectations of consumers or merchants, third-party intellectual property rights, and other factors. Our success will depend on our ability to develop and incorporate new technologies and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards. If we are unable to do so in a timely or cost-effective manner, our business could be harmed. 16 LEGAL, REGULATORY AND COMPLIANCE RISKS Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight. Our failure to comply with extensive, complex, overlapping, and frequently changing rules, regulations, and legal interpretations could materially harm our business. Our business is subject to complex and changing laws, rules, regulations, policies, and legal interpretations in the markets in which we operate, including, but not limited to, those governing: banking, credit, deposit taking, cross-border and domestic money transmission, prepaid access, foreign currency exchange, privacy and data protection, data governance, cybersecurity, banking secrecy, digital payments and cryptocurrency, payment services (including payment processing and settlement services), fraud detection, consumer protection, antitrust and competition, economic and trade sanctions, anti-money laundering, and counter-terrorist financing.Regulators globally have been establishing and increasing their regulatory authority, oversight, and enforcement in ways that impact our business. As we introduce new products and services and expand into new markets, including through acquisitions, we may become subject to additional regulations, restrictions, and licensing requirements. As we expand and localize our international activities, we expect that our obligations in the markets in which we operate will continue to increase. In addition, because we facilitate sales of goods and provide services to customers worldwide, one or more jurisdictions may claim that we or our customers are required to comply with their laws which may impose different, more specific, or conflicting obligations on us, as well as broader liability. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or new laws, regulations, or orders of any government authority (including changes to or expansion of their interpretation) may subject us to significant fines, penalties, criminal and civil lawsuits, forfeiture of significant assets, and enforcement actions in one or more jurisdictions; result in additional compliance and licensure requirements; cause us to lose existing licenses or prevent or delay us from obtaining additional licenses that may be required for our business; increase regulatory scrutiny of our business; divert management’s time and attention from our business; restrict our operations; lead to increased friction for customers; force us to make changes to our business practices, products or operations; require us to engage in remediation activities; or delay planned transactions, product launches or improvements. Any of the foregoing could, individually or in the aggregate, harm our reputation, damage our brands and business, and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The complexity of U.S. federal and state and international regulatory and enforcement regimes, coupled with the global scope of our operations and the evolving global regulatory environment, could result in a single event prompting a large number of overlapping investigations and legal and regulatory proceedings by multiple government authorities in different jurisdictions. We have implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, and agents will not violate such laws and regulations. Payments Regulation In the U.S., PayPal, Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary) holds licenses to operate as a money transmitter (or its equivalent) in the states where such licenses are required, as well as in the District of Columbia and certain territories (as described further in “Item 1. Business – Government Regulation” of this Form 10-K). If we violate the laws or regulations covered under our licenses, we could be subject to liability and/or additional restrictions, forced to cease doing business with residents of certain states, forced to change our business practices, or required to obtain additional licenses or regulatory approvals, which could impose substantial costs. While we currently allow our customers to send payments from approximately 200 markets, we allow customers in only approximately half of those markets (including the U.S.) to also receive payments, in some cases with significant restrictions on the manner in which customers can hold balances or withdraw funds. These limitations may adversely affect our ability to grow our business in these markets.We principally provide our services to customers in the European Union (“EU”) and the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) through PayPal (Europe) S.à r.l. et Cie, S.C.A (“PayPal (Europe)”), our wholly-owned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a credit institution in Luxembourg. PayPal (Europe) is potentially subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if it violates applicable requirements imposed on Luxembourg credit institutions. Additionally, compliance with EU laws and regulations could become more costly and operationally difficult to manage due to potentially inconsistent interpretations and domestic regulations by EU member countries. European Directives, such as the Revised Payment Services Directive (“PSD2”) enabling payment and account information sharing by regulated payment providers, could subject us to data security and other legal and financial risks. If the business activities of PayPal (Europe) exceed certain thresholds, or if the European Central Bank (“ECB”) determines, PayPal (Europe) may be deemed a significant supervised entity and certain activity of PayPal (Europe) could become directly supervised by the ECB, rather than by the CSSF (the Luxembourg regulator), which 17 could subject us to additional requirements and would likely increase compliance costs.In many of the other markets outside the U.S. in which we do business, we serve our customers through PayPal Pte. Ltd., our wholly-owned subsidiary based in Singapore. PayPal Pte. Ltd. is supervised by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”), but does not hold a remittance license. As a result, PayPal Pte. Ltd. is not able to offer outbound remittance payments from Singapore. In many of the markets (other than Singapore) served by PayPal Pte. Ltd., it is unclear and uncertain whether our Singapore-based service is subject only to Singapore law or, if it is subject to the application of local laws, whether such local laws would require a payment processor like us to be licensed as a payments service, bank, financial institution, or otherwise. The Payment Services Act came into effect in Singapore in January 2020. PayPal Pte. Ltd. has submitted an application for a Major Payment Institution license to the MAS to continue to provide payments services. It will continue to operate within a statutory transition period while the application is pending. Once PayPal Pte. Ltd. obtains its license, we will be required to comply with new regulatory requirements, which will result in increased operational complexity and costs for our Singapore and international operations. In the additional markets in which we do business, we provide our services to customers through a local subsidiary subject to local regulatory supervision or oversight and we may be subject to significant fines or other enforcement actions if we violate applicable requirements. From time to time, we may also acquire entities subject to local payments regulatory supervision or oversight. There are substantial costs and potential product and operational changes involved in maintaining and renewing licenses, certifications, and approvals, and we could be subject to fines, other enforcement actions, and litigation if we are found to violate any of these requirements. There can be no assurance that we will be able to (or decide to) continue to apply for or obtain any licenses, renewals, certifications, and approvals in any jurisdictions. In certain markets, we may rely on local banks or other partners to process payments and conduct foreign currency exchange transactions in local currency, and local regulators may use their authority over such local partners to prohibit, restrict, or limit us from doing business. The need to obtain or maintain licenses, certifications, or other regulatory approvals could impose substantial additional costs, delay or preclude planned transactions, product launches or improvements, require significant and costly operational changes, impose restrictions, limitations, or additional requirements on our business, products and services, or prevent us from providing our products or services in a given market. Lending Regulation PayPal’s U.S. consumer short-term installment loan product is subject to state lending laws (some of which require licensure and/or state regulator notification), state collection laws, as well as compliance with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B as implemented by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) and other applicable laws and regulations. Changes to state laws and regulatory interpretation may require us to make product changes, incur substantial additional costs, or cease lending in a particular state. We could be subject to fines, other enforcement action, and litigation if we are found to violate any aspects of installment loan regulations. Consumer Protection Violations of federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations, including the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (“EFTA”) and Regulation E as implemented by the CFPB, could result in the assessment of significant actual damages or statutory damages or penalties (including treble damages in some instances) and plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees. We are subject to, and have paid amounts in settlement of, lawsuits containing allegations that our business violated the EFTA and Regulation E or otherwise advance claims for relief relating to our business practices (e.g., that we improperly held consumer funds or otherwise improperly limited consumer accounts).The CFPB issued a final rule on prepaid accounts that came into effect on April 1, 2019. We have implemented certain changes to comply with the final rule and made substantial changes to the design of certain U.S. consumer accounts and their operability, which could lead to unintended customer confusion and dissatisfaction, discourage customers from opening new accounts, require us to reallocate resources, and increase our costs, which could negatively affect our business. PayPal principally offers its services in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) countries through a “passport” notification process through the Luxembourg regulator (in the case of PayPal (Europe)) to regulators in other EEA member states in accordance with EU regulations. Regulators in these countries could notify us of local consumer protection laws that apply to our business, in addition to Luxembourg consumer protection laws, and could also seek to persuade the local regulator to order PayPal to conduct its activities in the local country directly or through a branch office. These or similar actions by these regulators could increase the cost of, or delay, our ability to expand our business in Europe. 18 Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing; Economic and Trade Sanctions Regulators in the U.S. and around the world continue to increase standards and expectations regarding anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing, and expand the scope of existing laws and regulations to emerging products and markets, which may require us to further revise or expand our compliance program globally and/or in specific jurisdictions, including the procedures we use to verify the identity of our customers and to monitor international and domestic transactions. Such changes could have the effect of making compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage, lead to increased friction for customers, and result in a decrease in business. Regulators regularly re-examine the transaction volume thresholds at which we must obtain and keep applicable records or verify identities of customers and any change in such thresholds could result in greater compliance costs and impact our business. In addition, we are required to comply with economic and trade sanctions administered by the U.S, the EU, relevant EU member states, and other jurisdictions in which we operate. Non-compliance with anti-money laundering laws and regulations or economic and trade sanctions may subject us to significant fines, penalties, lawsuits, and enforcement actions, result in regulatory sanctions and additional compliance requirements, increase regulatory scrutiny of our business, restrict our operations, or damage our reputation and brands. See “Note 13—Commitments and Contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements for disclosure relating to possible violations arising from our sanctions compliance program. Privacy and Protection of Customer Data The legal and regulatory environment relating to “privacy and data protection laws” (as defined in “Item 1. Business— Government Regulation”) continues to develop and evolve in ways we cannot predict, including with respect to technologies such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, cryptocurrency, and blockchain technology. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our privacy policies as communicated to users or with privacy and data protection laws could result in proceedings or actions against us by data protection authorities, government entities, or others. Such proceedings or actions could subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments, and negative publicity which may require us to change our business practices, increase the costs and complexity of compliance, and materially harm our business. In addition, compliance with inconsistent privacy and data protection laws may restrict our ability to provide products and services to our customers. For further information regarding data protection and information security, see “Item 1. Business—Government Regulation”.PayPal relies on a variety of compliance methods to transfer personal data of EEA individuals to the U.S., including Binding Corporate Rules (“BCRs”) for internal transfers of certain types of personal data and Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”) as approved by the European Commission for transfers to and from third parties. PayPal must also ensure that third parties processing personal data of PayPal’s EEA customers and/or employees outside of the EEA have compliant transfer mechanisms. In July 2020, the European Court of Justice invalidated the Privacy Shield regime and raised several questions regarding the efficacy of SCCs focusing on whether data transfers under SCCs are consistent with the EU privacy principles. To the extent PayPal relies on SCCs, or any third party relies on the Privacy Shield regime for the compliant transfer of personal data, PayPal’s ability to process EEA personal data to such parties could be jeopardized. We are subject to regulatory activity and legal proceedings under antitrust and competition laws. We are subject to scrutiny by various government agencies regarding antitrust and competition laws and regulations in the U.S. and internationally, including in connection with proposed business combinations, acquisitions, and investments. Some jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to assert claims of anticompetitive conduct. Other companies and government agencies have in the past and may in the future allege that our actions violate the antitrust or competition laws of the U.S., individual states, other countries, or the EU, or otherwise constitute unfair competition. Some regulators and legislators, particularly those outside of the U.S., may perceive that our products and services are used so broadly that otherwise uncontroversial business practices could be deemed anticompetitive. Any claims or investigations, even if without merit, may be very expensive to defend or respond to, involve negative publicity, and substantial diversion of management time and effort, and could result in reputational harm, significant judgments, fines and remedial actions against us, or require us to change our business practices, make product or operational changes, or delay or preclude planned transactions, product launches or improvements. We are regularly subject to general litigation, regulatory actions, and government inquiries. We are regularly subject to claims, individual and class action lawsuits, government and regulatory investigations, inquiries, actions or requests, and other proceedings alleging violations of laws, rules, and regulations with respect to competition, antitrust, intellectual property, privacy, data protection, information security, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, sanctions, anti-corruption, consumer protection, fraud, accessibility, securities, tax, labor and employment, commercial 19 disputes, services, charitable fundraising, contract disputes, escheatment of unclaimed or abandoned property, product liability, the matters described in “Note 13—Commitments and Contingencies—Litigation and Regulatory Matters—General Matters” to our consolidated financial statements, and other matters. The number and significance of these disputes and inquiries may increase as our business expands in scale, scope, and geographic reach, including through acquisitions of businesses and technology, and our products and services increase in scale and complexity. The legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, expensive and disruptive to our operations, and could result in substantial payments to satisfy judgments, fines, penalties or settlements, negative publicity, substantial diversion of management time and effort, reputational harm, criminal sanctions, orders that prevent us from offering certain products or services, requirements to change our business practices in costly ways, develop non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies, pay substantial royalty or licensing fees or delay or preclude planned transactions, product launches or improvements. Determining legal reserves or possible losses from such matters involves judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes. We may be exposed to losses in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material. If any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Third parties may allege that we are infringing their patents and other intellectual property rights. We are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. At any given time, we are typically a defendant in a number of patent lawsuits and subject to intellectual property infringement claims. Intellectual property infringement claims against us may result from, among other things, our expansion into new business areas, including through acquisitions of businesses and technology, the expansion in scope and complexity of our products and services and their convergence with technologies not previously associated with areas related to our business, products, and services. The ultimate outcome of any allegation or claim is often uncertain and any such claim, with or without merit, may be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert management’s time and attention from our business, and require us to, among other things, redesign or stop providing our products or services, pay substantial amounts to settle claims or lawsuits, satisfy judgments, or pay substantial royalty or licensing fees. We may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights. The protection of our intellectual property, including our trademarks, patents, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, and trade secrets, is important to the success of our business. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every jurisdiction in which we offer our products and services. Although we have generally taken measures to protect our intellectual property rights, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in protecting or enforcing our rights in every jurisdiction, or that our contractual arrangements will prevent or deter third parties from infringing or misappropriating our intellectual property, and third parties may independently develop equivalent or superior intellectual property rights. We may be required to expend significant time and expense to prevent infringement and enforce our rights, and we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. If we are unable to prevent third parties from using or offering technologies that infringe our patent or trade secret rights, the uniqueness and value of our products and services could be adversely affected. If we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting, registering, or using trademarks and trade dress that infringe, dilute, or otherwise violate our trademark rights, the value of our brands could be diminished and our business could be adversely affected. We have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to others. These licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation. Any failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or significant costs incurred in doing so, could diminish the value of our intangible assets and materially harm our business. BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS RISKS We face substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry. The global payments industry is highly competitive, continuously changing, highly innovative, and increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny and oversight. Many areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with innovative and disruptive technologies, shifting user preferences and needs, price sensitivity of merchants and consumers, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Competition also may intensify as new competitors emerge, businesses enter into business combinations and partnerships, and established companies in other segments expand to become competitive with various aspects of our business.We compete with a wide range of businesses. Some of our current and potential competitors are larger operationally and/or financially than we are, have larger customer bases, greater brand recognition, longer operating histories, a dominant or more secure position, broader geographic scope, volume, scale, resources, and market share than we do, or offer products and services that we do not offer, which may provide them significant competitive advantages. Some competitors may also be 20 subject to less burdensome regulatory requirements or may be smaller or younger companies that may be more agile and effective in responding quickly to user needs, technological innovations, and legal and regulatory changes. These competitors may devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of products and services, and/or offer lower prices or more effectively offer their own innovative programs, products, and services. We often partner with many of these businesses and we consider the ability to continue establishing these partnerships to be important to our business. Competition for relationships with these partners is intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to establish, grow, or maintain these partner relationships. See “Item 1. Business—Competition” of this Form 10-K for further discussion of the competitive environment in the markets where we operate. If we are not able to differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors, drive value for our customers, or effectively and efficiently align our resources with our goals and objectives, we may not be able to compete effectively in the market. Changes to payment card networks or bank fees, rules, or practices could harm our business. To process certain transactions, we must comply with applicable payment card network, bank or other network (collectively, “network”) rules. The rules govern all aspects of a transaction, including fees and other practices. From time to time, the networks have increased the fees and assessments that they charge for transactions that access their networks. Certain of the networks have also imposed special fees or assessments for transactions that are executed through a digital wallet such as the one that PayPal offers. Our payment processors may have the right to pass any increases in fees and assessments on to us as well as increase their own fees for processing. Any increase in interchange fees, special fees, or assessments for transactions that we pay to our payment processors or the networks could make our pricing less competitive, increase our operating costs, and reduce our operating income, which could materially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.In some jurisdictions, government regulations have required the payment card networks to reduce or cap interchange fees. Any changes in interchange fee rates or limitations, or their applicability to PayPal, could adversely affect our competitive position against traditional payment card service providers and the revenue we earn from our branded card programs, require us to change our business practices and harm our business.We may also be subject to fines assessed by the networks resulting from any rule violations by us or our merchants. The networks set and interpret their rules and have alleged from time to time that various aspects of our business model violate these operating rules. Such allegations may result in significant fines and penalties or require changes in our business practices that may be costly and adversely affect our business. The network rules may also increase the cost of, impose restrictions on, or otherwise impact the development of, our retail point-of-sale solutions, which may negatively affect their deployment and adoption. The networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or re-interpret existing rules that we or our payment processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow, or costly to implement, which could require us to make significant changes to our products. If we become unable or limited in our ability to accept certain payment types such as debit or credit cards, our business would be adversely affected. Changes in how consumers fund their PayPal transactions could harm our business. We pay transaction fees when consumers fund payment transactions using credit cards, lower fees when consumers fund payments with debit cards, and nominal fees when consumers fund payment transactions by electronic transfer of funds from bank accounts, from an existing PayPal account balance or Venmo account balance, or through our PayPal branded consumer credit products. Our financial performance is sensitive to changes in the rate at which our consumers fund payments using payment cards, which can significantly increase our costs. Although we provide consumers in certain markets with the opportunity to use their existing PayPal account balance or Venmo account balance to fund payment transactions, some of our consumers may prefer to use payment cards, which may offer features and benefits not provided as part of their PayPal accounts. An increase in the portion of our payment volume funded using payment cards or in fees associated with our funding mix, or other events or developments that make it more difficult or costly for us to fund transactions with lower-cost funding options, could materially and adversely affect our financial performance and significantly harm our business. Our ability to receive the benefit of our merchant lending offerings may be subject to challenge. Merchant loans and advances under our U.S. PayPal Working Capital (“PPWC”) and PayPal Business Loan (“PPBL”) products are provided by a state chartered industrial bank under a program agreement with us, and we acquire the receivables generated by those loans after origination. In June 2020, largely in response to the Madden v. Midland Funding, LLC case decided in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) approved a final rule clarifying that loans originated by state-chartered banks remain valid throughout the lifetime of the loan, reflecting a similar rule finalized by the Office of the Comptroller of Currency (“OCC”) in May 2020. The final rule reaffirms and codifies in regulation the so-called “valid-when-made doctrine,” which provides that the interest rate for a loan is determined when the 21 loan is made and will not be affected by subsequent events such as sale, assignment, or other transfer. A number of state attorneys general have challenged these FDIC and OCC rules, and there remains some uncertainty whether non-bank entities purchasing loan receivables originated by FDIC-insured, state chartered industrial banks, may rely on federal preemption of state usury laws and other state laws. An adverse outcome of these or similar challenges, or changes to applicable laws and regulations, could materially impact our U.S. PPWC and PPBL products and our business. Our credit products expose us to additional risks. We offer credit products to a wide range of consumers and merchants in the U.S. and various international markets. The financial success of these products depends on the effective management of related risk. The credit decision-making process for our consumer credit products uses proprietary methodologies and credit algorithms and other analytical techniques designed to analyze the credit risk of specific consumers based on, among other factors, their past purchase and transaction history with PayPal or Venmo and their credit scores. Similarly, proprietary risk models and other indicators are applied to assess merchants who desire to use our merchant lending offerings to help predict their ability to repay. These risk models may not accurately predict the creditworthiness of a consumer or merchant due to inaccurate assumptions, including those related to the particular consumer or merchant, market conditions, economic environment, or limited transaction history or other data. The accuracy of these risk models and the ability to manage credit risk related to our credit products may also be affected by legal or regulatory requirements, changes in consumer behavior, changes in the economic environment, issuing bank policies, and other factors. We generally rely on third-party chartered financial institutions to provide PayPal and Venmo branded consumer credit and merchant lending offerings to our U.S. customers. As a service provider to these third-party chartered financial institutions, which are federally supervised U.S. financial institutions, we are subject from time to time to examination by their federal banking regulators. In the event of any termination or interruption in a partner bank’s ability or willingness to lend, our ability to offer consumer credit and merchant credit products could be interrupted or limited, which could materially and adversely affect our business. We may be unable to reach a similar arrangement with another chartered financial institution on favorable terms or at all. Obtaining licenses to originate such loans would be a costly, time-consuming and uncertain process, and would subject us to additional laws and regulatory requirements, which could significantly increase our costs and compliance obligations and require us to change our business practices.We are subject to the risk that account holders who use our credit products will default on their payment obligations, creating the risk of potential charge-offs or negatively impacting our revenue share arrangement with Synchrony Bank. The non-payment rate among account holders may increase due to, among other factors, changes to underwriting standards, risk models not accurately predicting the creditworthiness of a user, worsening economic conditions, such as a recession or government austerity programs, increases in prevailing interest rates, and high unemployment rates. Account holders who miss payments often fail to repay their loans, and account holders who file for protection under the bankruptcy laws generally do not repay their loans. We currently purchase receivables related to our merchant lending offerings in the U.S. and extend credit for our consumer and merchants products outside the U.S. through our international subsidiaries. If we are unable to fund our credit business adequately or in a cost-effective manner, or if we are unable to efficiently manage the cash resources utilized for these purposes, the growth of our credit business could be negatively impacted. We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk. We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, including: networks, banks, payment processors, and payment gateways that link us to the payment card and bank clearing networks to process transactions; unaffiliated third-party lenders to originate our U.S. PayPal Credit, U.S. merchant credit, and branded credit card products; our branded debit card products; cryptocurrency custodial service providers; and external business partners and contractors who provide key functions (e.g., outsourced customer support and product development functions; facilities; information technology, data center facilities and cloud computing). These risks may include legal, regulatory, information security, reputational, operational, or any other risks inherent in engaging a third party. If we are unable to effectively manage our third-party relationships, these third parties are unable to meet their obligations to us, or we experience substantial disruptions in these relationships, our operations, results of operations, and financial results could be adversely impacted. Additionally, while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships, they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, governance, and compliance, thereby potentially increasing our financial, legal, reputational, and operational risk. 22 Any factors that reduce cross-border trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business. Cross-border trade (i.e., transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries) is an important source of our revenues and profits. Cross-border transactions generally provide higher revenues and operating income than similar transactions that take place within a single country or market. In certain markets, cross-border trade represents our primary (and in some instances our only) presence. Cross-border trade may be negatively impacted by various factors including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions in the context of cross-border trade and foreign exchange. Any factors that increase the costs of cross-border trade for us or our customers or that restrict, delay, or make cross-border trade more difficult or impractical, such as trade policy or higher tariffs, could reduce our cross-border transactions and volume, negatively impact our revenues and profits, and harm our business. Failure to deal effectively with fraud, fictitious transactions, bad transactions, and negative customer experiences would increase our loss rate and could negatively impact our business and severely diminish merchant and consumer confidence in and use of our services. Our buyer and seller protection programs protect merchants and consumers from fraudulent transactions, and protect consumers if they do not receive the item ordered or if the item received is significantly different from its description. We incur substantial losses from our buyer and seller protection programs as a result of claims from consumers. We seek to recover losses from our buyer and seller protection programs from the merchant, but may not fully recover them if the merchant is unwilling or unable to pay or the transaction involves a fraudulent merchant. In addition, in the event of the bankruptcy or other business interruption of a merchant that sells goods or services in advance of the date of their delivery or use (e.g., airline, cruise, or concert tickets, custom-made goods, and subscriptions), we could be liable to the buyers of such goods or services, including through our buyer protection program or through chargebacks on payment cards used by customers to fund their payments. Allowances for transaction losses that we have established may be insufficient to cover incurred losses. We also incur substantial losses from claims that the consumer did not authorize the purchase, fraud, erroneous transactions, and customers who have closed bank accounts or have insufficient funds in their bank accounts to satisfy payments. In addition, consumers who pay through PayPal may have reimbursement rights from their payment card issuer, which in turn will seek recovery from us. If losses incurred by us related to payment card transactions become excessive, we could lose the ability to accept payment cards for payment, which would negatively impact our business. Measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud require continuous improvement and may not be effective in detecting and preventing fraud, particularly new and continually evolving forms of fraud or in connection with new or expanded product offerings. If these measures do not succeed, our business could be negatively impacted. Increases in our loss rate, including as a result of changes to the scope of transactions covered by our buyer and seller protection programs, could negatively impact our business. See “Note 13—Commitments and Contingencies— Protection Programs” to our consolidated financial statements. Use of our payments services for illegal purposes could harm our business. Our payment system is susceptible to potentially illegal or improper uses, including money laundering, terrorist financing, sanctions evasion, illegal online gambling, fraudulent sales of goods or services, illegal sales of prescription medications or controlled substances, piracy of software, movies, music, and other copyrighted or trademarked goods (in particular, digital goods), bank fraud, child pornography, human trafficking, prohibited sales of alcoholic beverages or tobacco products, securities fraud, pyramid or ponzi schemes, or the facilitation of other illegal or improper activity. The use of our payment system for illegal or improper uses has subjected us, and may subject us in the future, to claims, individual and class action lawsuits, and government and regulatory requests, inquiries, or investigations that could result in liability and harm our reputation. Moreover, certain activity that may be legal in one jurisdiction may be illegal in another jurisdiction, and a merchant may be found responsible for intentionally or inadvertently importing or exporting illegal goods, resulting in liability for us. Owners of intellectual property rights or government authorities may seek to bring legal action against providers of payments solutions, including PayPal, that are peripherally involved in the sale of infringing or allegedly infringing items. Any threatened or resulting claims could result in reputational harm, and any resulting liabilities, loss of transaction volume, or increased costs could harm our business. Acquisitions, strategic investments, and other strategic transactions could result in operating difficulties and could harm our business. We expect to continue to consider and evaluate a wide array of potential strategic transactions as part of our overall business strategy, including, but not limited to, business combinations, acquisitions, and dispositions of certain businesses, technologies, services, products, and other assets; strategic investments; and commercial and strategic partnerships (collectively, “strategic 23 transactions”). At any given time, we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more strategic transactions, any of which could, individually or in the aggregate, be material to our financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying, negotiating, and consummating favorable transaction opportunities. Strategic transactions may involve additional significant challenges, uncertainties, and risks, including, but not limited to, challenges of integrating new employees, systems, technologies, and business cultures; failure to develop the acquired business adequately; disruption of our ongoing operations and diversion of our management’s attention; inadequate data security, cybersecurity and operational and information technology resilience; failure to identify, or our underestimation of, commitments, liabilities, deficiencies and other risks associated with acquired businesses or assets; and potential exposure to new or increased regulatory oversight and uncertain or evolving legal, regulatory, and compliance requirements; potential reputational risks that could arise from transactions with, or investments in, companies involved in new or developing businesses or industries, which may be subject to uncertain or evolving legal, regulatory, and compliance requirements; failure of the transaction to advance our business strategy and of its anticipated benefits to materialize; potential impairment of goodwill or other acquisition-related intangible assets; and the potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities or significant additional debt. Strategic transactions may also heighten many of the risks described in this “Risk Factors” section. These transactions are inherently risky, may not be successful, and may harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Strategic investments in which we have a minority ownership stake inherently involve a lesser degree of influence over business operations. In addition, we may be dependent on controlling shareholders, management, or other persons or entities who control them and who may have business interests, strategies, or goals that are inconsistent with ours. Business decisions or other actions or omissions of the controlling shareholders, management, or other persons or entities who control companies in which we invest may adversely affect the value of our investment, result in litigation or regulatory action against us, and otherwise damage our reputation and brand. Our international operations subject us to increased risks, which could harm our business. Our international operations generate approximately one-half of our net revenues. Our international operations, including any expansion in international markets, subject us to significant challenges, uncertainties, and risks, including, but not limited to: local regulatory, licensing, reporting, and legal obligations; costs and challenges associated with operating in markets in which we may have limited or no experience, including effectively localizing our products and services and adapting them to local preferences; difficulties in developing, staffing, and simultaneously managing a large number of varying foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences and in light of varying laws, regulations, and customs; difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified company employees and maintaining our company culture; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; exchange control regulations; profit repatriation restrictions; potential tariffs, sanctions, fines, or other trade barriers or restrictions; import or export regulations; compliance with U.S. and foreign anti-corruption, anti-bribery, sanctions, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws and regulations; the interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions; and national or regional political, economic, or social instability.Our international operations also may heighten many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section. Violations of the complex foreign and U.S. laws, rules and regulations that may apply to our international operations may result in fines, criminal actions, or sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibit or require us to change the way we conduct our business; and damage our reputation. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies. These risks are inherent in our international operations, may increase our costs of doing business internationally, and could materially and adversely affect our business. Brexit: The United Kingdom’s departure from the EU could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Following the departure of the U.K. from the EU and the EEA on January 31, 2020 (commonly referred to as “Brexit”) and the expiration of a transition period on December 31, 2020, there continues to be uncertainty over the practical consequences of Brexit including the potential for Brexit to contribute to long-term instability in financial, stock and currency exchange markets, greater restrictions on the supply and availability of goods and services between the U.K. and EEA region, and a general deterioration in consumer sentiment and credit conditions leading to overall negative economic growth and increased risk of merchant default.The consequences of Brexit have brought legal uncertainty and increased complexity for financial services firms, which could continue as national laws and regulations in the U.K. differ from EU laws and regulations and additional authorization requirements come into effect. These developments have led to additional regulatory costs and challenges for us, including: 24 •PayPal (Europe) operates in the U.K. within the scope of its passport permissions (as they stood at the end of the transition period) pursuant to the Temporary Permissions Regime pending the grant of new UK authorizations by the U.K. financial regulators. If we are unable to obtain the required authorizations before the expiry of the longstop dates set by the U.K. regulators under the Temporary Permissions Regime, our European operations could lose their ability to offer services into the U.K. market on a cross-border basis; and•our European operations are required to comply with new legal and regulatory requirements in the U.K. that occasionally are in addition to, or inconsistent with, those of the EEA, in each case, leading to increased complexity and costs. Global and regional economic conditions could harm our business. Adverse global and regional economic conditions such as turmoil affecting the banking system or financial markets, including tightening in the credit markets, extreme volatility or distress in the financial markets (including the fixed income, credit, currency, equity, and commodity markets), higher unemployment, high consumer debt levels, reduced consumer confidence or economic activity, government fiscal and tax policies, U.S and international trade relationships, agreements, treaties, tariffs and restrictive actions, the inability of a government to enact a budget in a fiscal year, government shutdowns, government austerity programs, and other negative financial news or macroeconomic developments could have a material adverse impact on the demand for our products and services, including a reduction in the volume and size of transactions on our Payments Platform. Additionally, any inability to access the capital markets when needed due to volatility or illiquidity in the markets and increased regulatory liquidity and capital requirements may strain our liquidity position. Such conditions may also expose us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates that could materially and adversely affect our financial results. See “Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange Rates and Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” for additional information on our financial risks. If one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their financial or performance obligations to us or fail, we may incur significant losses. We have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents, receivables outstanding, and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the U.S. and international jurisdictions. As part of our currency hedging activities, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments with various financial institutions. Certain banks and financial institutions are also lenders under our credit facilities. We regularly monitor our exposure to counterparty credit risk, and actively manage this exposure to mitigate the associated risk. Despite these efforts, we may be exposed to the risk of default by, or deteriorating operating results or financial condition or failure of, these counterparty financial institutions. If one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or to access or recover our assets that are deposited, held in accounts with, or otherwise due from, such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty’s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties, we could incur significant losses, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. There are risks associated with our indebtedness. We have incurred indebtedness, and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations and generate sufficient cash flows to service such debt. Our outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness we incur may have significant consequences, including, without limitation: requiring us to use a significant portion of our cash flow from operations and other available cash to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes, including capital expenditures, acquisitions, and strategic investments; reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business, competition pressures and market conditions; and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, or other general corporate and other purposes.Our revolving credit facilities and the indenture for our senior unsecured notes pursuant to which certain of our outstanding debt securities were issued contain financial and other covenants that restrict or could restrict, among other things, our business and operations. If we fail to pay amounts due under a debt instrument or breach any of its covenants, the lenders would typically have the right to demand immediate repayment of all borrowings thereunder (subject in certain cases to a grace or cure period). Moreover, any such acceleration and required repayment of, or default in respect of, our indebtedness could, in turn, constitute an event of default under other debt instruments, thereby resulting in the acceleration and required repayment of our indebtedness. Any of these events could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition. 25 Changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity securities and increase our borrowing costs. If our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, the interest rates payable by us under our indebtedness may increase, and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected. Changes in tax laws, exposure to unanticipated additional tax liabilities, or implementation of record-keeping obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business. An increasing number of U.S. states, the U.S. federal government, and foreign jurisdictions, as well as international organizations, such as the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and the EU Commission, are focused on tax reform and other legislative or regulatory action to increase tax revenue. Various countries have proposed or enacted digital services taxes. These actions may materially affect our effective tax rate.The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation and significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are currently undergoing a number of investigations, audits, and reviews by tax authorities in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could result in unforeseen tax-related liabilities that differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements, which may, individually or in the aggregate, materially affect our financial results in the periods for which such determination is made. While we have established reserves based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventualities, these reserves may prove to be insufficient.In addition, our future income taxes could be adversely affected by the incurrence of losses or earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates, and earnings being higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, including as a result of gains on our foreign currency exchange risk management program; by changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles; or by certain discrete items.A number of U.S. states, the U.S. federal government, and foreign jurisdictions have implemented and may impose reporting or record-keeping obligations on companies that engage in or facilitate e-commerce to improve tax compliance. A number of jurisdictions are also reviewing whether payment service providers and other intermediaries could be deemed to be the legal agent of merchants for certain tax purposes. We have modified our systems to meet applicable requirements and expect that further modifications will be required to comply with future requirements, which may negatively impact our customer experience and increase operational costs. Any failure by us to comply with these and similar reporting and record-keeping obligations could result in substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions, adversely impact our ability to do business in certain jurisdictions, and harm our business. If the distribution of our common stock in connection with our separation from eBay, together with certain related transactions, does not qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we and certain of our stockholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities. On July 17, 2015, we became an independent publicly traded company through the pro rata distribution by eBay Inc. of 100% of our outstanding common stock to eBay’s stockholders (which we refer to as the “separation” or the “distribution”). eBay received an opinion from its outside legal counsel regarding the qualification of the distribution, together with certain related transactions, as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Internal Revenue Code. Notwithstanding the opinion of counsel, the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) could determine that the distribution, together with certain related transactions, should be treated as a taxable transaction if the IRS determines that any of these representations, assumptions, or undertakings upon which such opinion was based are incorrect or have been violated or if the IRS disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel. If the distribution, together with certain related transactions, failed to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free, eBay stockholders who received PayPal common stock in the distribution may be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares, and we could incur significant liabilities. 26 There are risks associated with our relationship with eBay. In connection with our separation from eBay, we entered into a separation and distribution agreement with eBay and various other agreements, including an operating agreement and agreements covering tax, employee, and intellectual property matters, data sharing, and product development. These agreements determined the allocation of assets and liabilities between the companies following the separation for those respective areas and associated indemnification obligations and established certain commercial relationships between eBay and us. If either we or eBay are unable to satisfy our performance, payment, or indemnification obligations under these agreements or other commercial agreements between the parties, we could incur operational difficulties or losses or be required to make substantial indemnification or other payments to eBay.We expect the portion of our revenue and operating income attributable to eBay will continue to decline due to various factors, including the speed and extent to which eBay intermediates payments on its platform and migrates eBay merchants to eBay’s managed payments platform, limits the availability of PayPal as a payment option, offers or promotes alternative payment options, directs transactions on its platforms to different providers of payment services, or eliminates or modifies its risk management or customer protection programs on its platforms, which could result in customer dissatisfaction, reduction in eBay volume, and other consequences adverse to our business. If we are unable to generate sufficient business from our non-eBay customers to offset the expected reduction in the portion of our business attributable to eBay, the growth of our business and our ability to meet our long-term financial targets could be negatively impacted. We may be unable to attract, retain, and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our business. Competition for key and other highly skilled personnel is intense, especially for executive talent, software engineers, and other technology talent. We may be limited in our ability to recruit or hire internationally, including due to restrictive laws or policies on immigration, travel, or availability of visas for skilled workers. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel, or our inability to attract, hire, train, and retain highly qualified personnel effectively, could harm our business and growth prospects. We are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our products and services. We may be subject to claims relating to information disseminated through our online services, including claims alleging defamation, libel, harassment, hate speech, breach of contract, invasion of privacy, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through the services, among other things. If the laws or regulations that provide protections for online dissemination of information are invalidated or are modified to reduce protections available to us and we become liable for information provided by our customers and carried on our products and services, we could be directly harmed and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure, including expending substantial resources or discontinuing certain product or service offerings, which could harm our business. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. You should carefully review this section in addition to the other information appearing in this Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, for important information regarding risks and uncertainties that affect us.

    "context": "Overview PayPal Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in January 2015 and is a leading technology platform and digital payments company that enables digital and mobile payments on behalf of consumers and merchants worldwide. PayPal is committed to democratizing financial services and empowering people and businesses to join and thrive in the global economy. Our goal is to enable our consumers and merchants to manage and move their money anywhere in the world, anytime, on any platform, and using any device. Our combined payment solutions, including our PayPal, PayPal Credit, Braintree, Venmo, Xoom, and iZettle products and services, comprise our proprietary Payments Platform. PayPal’s payment solutions enable our customers to send and receive payments. We operate a global, two-sided network at scale that connects merchants and consumers with 305 million active accounts (consisting of 281 million consumer active accounts and 24 million merchant active accounts) across more than 200 markets. PayPal helps merchants and consumers connect, transact, and complete payments, whether they are online, on a mobile device, in an app, or in person. PayPal is more than a connection to third-party payment networks. We provide proprietary payment solutions accepted by merchants that enable the completion of payments on our Payments Platform on behalf of our customers. We offer our customers the flexibility to use their accounts to purchase and receive payment for goods and services, as well as the ability to transfer and withdraw funds. We enable consumers to exchange funds more safely with merchants using a variety of funding sources, which may include a bank account, a PayPal account balance, a Venmo account balance, a PayPal Credit account, a credit or debit card, or other stored value products such as coupons, gift cards, and eligible credit card rewards. Our PayPal, Venmo, and Xoom products also make it safer and simpler for friends and family to transfer funds to each other. We offer merchants an end-to-end payments solution that provides authorization and settlement capabilities, as well as instant access to funds. We help merchants connect with their customers and manage risk. We enable consumers to engage in cross-border shopping and merchants to extend their global reach while reducing the complexity and friction involved in enabling overseas and cross-border trade. We earn revenues primarily by charging fees for completing payment transactions for our customers and other payment-related services that are typically based on the volume of activity processed on our Payments Platform. Generally we do not charge consumers to fund or draw from their accounts; however, we generate revenue from consumers on fees charged for foreign currency exchange, and instant transfers from their PayPal or Venmo account to their debit card or bank account, as well as from interest and fees from our PayPal Credit product. We also earn revenue by providing other value added services, which comprise revenue earned through partnerships, our PayPal merchant and consumer credit products, subscription fees, gateway services, and other services that we provide to our merchants and consumers. Our gateway services, which include our Payflow Gateway service and Braintree Gateway service, provide the technology that links a merchant’s website to its processing network and merchant account and enables merchants to accept payments online with credit or debit cards. 4 Table of Contents Strategy Our ability to grow revenue is affected by, among other things, consumer spending patterns, merchant and consumer adoption of digital payment methods, the expansion of multiple commerce channels, the growth of mobile devices and merchant and consumer applications on those devices, the growth of consumers globally with internet and mobile access, the pace of transition from cash and checks to digital forms of payment, our share of the digital payments market, and our ability to innovate and introduce new products and services that merchants and consumers value. Our strategy to drive growth in our business includes the following:•Growing our core business: through expanding our global capabilities, customer base and scale, increasing our customers’ use of our products and services by better addressing their everyday needs related to accessing, managing, and moving money, and expanding the adoption of our solutions by merchants and consumers;•Expanding our value proposition for merchants and consumers: by being technology and platform agnostic, partnering with our merchants to grow and expand their business online and in-store; and providing consumers with simple, secure, and flexible ways to manage and move money across different markets, merchants, and platforms; •Forming strategic partnerships: by building new strategic partnerships to provide better experiences for our customers, offering greater choice and flexibility, acquiring new customers, and reinforcing our role in the ecosystem; and•Seeking new areas of growth: organically and through acquisitions and strategic investments in our existing and new international markets around the world and focusing on innovation both in the digital and physical world. Key Performance Metrics We measure the relevance of our products and services to our customers, and therefore the success of our business, through active accounts, payment transactions, and total payment volume:Active Accounts: An active account is an account registered directly with PayPal or a platform access partner that has completed a transaction on our Payments Platform, not including gateway-exclusive transactions, within the past 12 months. A platform access partner is a third-party whose customers are provided access to PayPal’s Payments Platform through such third-party’s login credentials. A market is a geographic area or political jurisdiction, such as a country, territory, or protectorate, in which we offer some or all of our products and services. A country, territory, or protectorate is identified by a distinct set of laws and regulations. Number of Payment Transactions: Number of payment transactions is the total number of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our Payments Platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions.Total Payment Volume (“TPV”): TPV is the value of payments, net of reversals, successfully completed on our Payments Platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions. 5 Table of Contents Our Strengths Our business is built on a strong foundation designed to drive growth and differentiate us from our competitors. We believe that our competitive strengths include the following:•Two-sided Platform—our platform connecting merchants and consumers enables PayPal to offer unique end-to-end product experiences while gaining valuable insights into customer behavior through our data. Our platform provides for digital, mobile, and in-store transactions while being both technology and platform agnostic.•Scale—our global scale allows us to drive organic growth. As of December 31, 2019, we had 305 million active accounts, consisting of 281 million consumer active accounts and 24 million merchant active accounts in more than 200 markets around the world. In 2019, we processed $712 billion of TPV.•Brands—we have built well-recognized and trusted brands. Our marketing efforts across multiple demographic groups play an important role in building brand visibility, usage, and overall preference among customers. •Risk Management—our risk management system and use of tokenization are designed to help keep customer information secure, and to help ensure we process legitimate transactions around the world, while identifying and minimizing illegal, high-risk, or fraudulent transactions.•Regulatory—we believe that our regulatory licenses, which enable us to operate in markets around the world, are a distinct advantage and help support business growth. Technology Our Payments Platform utilizes a combination of proprietary and third-party technologies and services intended to efficiently and securely facilitate transactions between millions of merchants and consumers worldwide across different channels, markets, and networks. Our Payments Platform connects with financial service providers around the world and allows consumers to make purchases using a wide range of payment methods, regardless of where a merchant is located. Consumers who use our Payments Platform can send payments in more than 200 markets around the world and in more than 100 currencies, withdraw funds to their bank accounts in 56 currencies and hold balances in their PayPal accounts in 25 currencies. A transaction on our Payments Platform can involve multiple participants in addition to us, including a merchant, a consumer, and the consumer’s funding source provider. We have developed intuitive user interfaces, customer tools, transaction completion database, and network applications on our Payments Platform that help our customers utilize our suite of products and services. Our Payments Platform, open application programming interfaces, and developer tools are designed to enable developers to innovate with ease and offer robust applications to our global ecosystem of merchants and consumers, while at the same time maintaining the security of our customers’ financial information. The technology infrastructure supporting our Payments Platform simplifies the storage and processing of large amounts of data and facilitates the deployment and operation of large-scale global products and services in both our own data centers and cloud computing. Our technology infrastructure is designed around industry best practices intended to reduce downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences. Our Payments Platform incorporates multiple layers of protection for business continuity and system redundancy purposes and to help address cybersecurity risks. We have a comprehensive cybersecurity program designed to protect our technology infrastructure and Payments Platform against these challenges, including regularly testing our systems to identify and address potential vulnerabilities. We strive to continually improve our technology infrastructure and Payments Platform to enhance the customer experience and to increase efficiency, scalability, and security. 6 Table of Contents Merchant and Consumer Payment Solutions Merchant Value Proposition We partner with our merchants to help grow and expand their businesses by providing global reach and powering all aspects of digital checkout. We offer alternative payment methods, including access to credit solutions, provide fraud prevention and risk management solutions, reducing losses through proprietary protection programs, and offer tools and insights for leveraging data analytics to attract new customers and improve sales conversion. We employ a technology and platform agnostic approach intended to enable merchants of all sizes to provide digital checkout online, on mobile, and in-store (at the point of sale) across all platforms and devices and to securely and simply receive payments from their customers. Merchants can onboard quickly with PayPal and are generally not required to invest in new or specialized hardware. PayPal is also a popular form of payment solution for mobile commerce, and our business has grown with the increased adoption of mobile devices. We believe our Braintree products strengthen our position in digital and mobile payments and extend our coverage to a new class of retailers and service providers that offer their services primarily through mobile applications. Through a single Braintree integration, a merchant can begin accepting payments with credit or debit cards, PayPal, PayPal Credit, Google Pay, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, and other payment solutions. iZettle offers a card acceptance service that enables small businesses to accept credit and debit card payments, as well as a software solution to record, manage, and analyze sales. iZettle provides in-store capabilities in twelve countries. During 2019, we launched PayPal for Marketplaces, our global, end-to-end solution designed to satisfy the unique payment needs of platforms, marketplaces, and crowdfunding sites, which provides payment solutions for accepting and disbursing funds between consumers and businesses. We also offer gateway services which provide the payment gateway technology that links a merchant’s website to its processing network and enable merchants to accept payments online with credit or debit cards. Our acquisition of a controlling equity interest in Guofubao Information Technology Co. (GoPay), Ltd (“GoPay”), a holder of payment business licenses in China, enables us to partner with Chinese financial institutions and technology platforms to provide a more comprehensive set of payment solutions to merchants and consumers, both in China and globally. We offer access to credit products for certain small and medium-sized merchants through our PayPal Working Capital and PayPal Business Loan products, which we collectively refer to as our business financing offerings. Our PayPal Working Capital product allows businesses to borrow a certain percentage of their annual payment volume processed by PayPal for a fixed fee. Our PayPal Business Loan product provides businesses with short-term financing for a fixed fee based on an evaluation of both the applying business as well as the business owner. We believe that our business financing offerings allow us to deepen our engagement with our existing small and medium-sized merchants and expand services to new merchants by providing access to capital that may not be available effectively or efficiently from traditional banks or other lending providers. We generate revenues from merchants primarily by charging fees for completing their payment transactions and other payment-related services. 7 Table of Contents Consumer Value Proposition We focus on providing affordable consumer products intended to democratize the management and movement of money. We provide consumers with a digital wallet which enables them to send payments to merchants more safely using a variety of funding sources, which may include a bank account, a PayPal account balance, a Venmo account balance, a PayPal Credit account, a credit or debit card, or other stored value products such as coupons, gift cards, and eligible credit card rewards. We also offer consumers person-to-person (“P2P”) payment solutions through our PayPal, Venmo, and Xoom products. PayPal continues to be a key driver of our total P2P volumes, enabling both domestic and international P2P transfers across our Payments Platform. Our Venmo app in the U.S. is a leading mobile application used to move money between our customers and to make purchases at approved merchants. Xoom is an international money transfer service that enables our customers to send money and prepaid mobile phone reloads to, and pay bills for, people around the world in a secure, fast, and cost-effective way. P2P is a significant customer acquisition channel that facilitates organic growth by enabling potential PayPal users to establish active accounts with us at the time they make or receive a P2P payment.We offer our PayPal Credit product to consumers in certain markets as a potential funding source at checkout. Once a consumer is approved for credit, PayPal Credit is made available as a funding source for that account holder. Our U.S. PayPal branded consumer credit program is offered exclusively through Synchrony Bank. We believe that our consumer credit products allow us to increase engagement with consumers and merchants on our two-sided network and differentiate us from other payment processors by helping merchants drive incremental sales. We generate revenue from consumers on fees charged for foreign currency exchange, optional instant transfers from their PayPal or Venmo account to their debit card or bank account, and on interest and fees from our PayPal Credit product. Protecting Merchants and Consumers Protecting merchants and consumers on our Payments Platform from financial and fraud loss is imperative to successfully competing in the payments industry and sustainably growing our business. Fraudulent activities, such as account takeover, identity theft (including stolen financial information), and counterparty malicious activities, represent a significant risk to merchants and consumers, as well as their payment partners. We provide merchants and consumers with protection programs on most purchase transactions completed on our Payments Platform, excluding gateway-exclusive transactions or situations where our customer agreements specifically do not provide for protections. We believe that these programs, which protect both merchants and consumers from financial loss resulting from fraud and counterparty non-performance, are generally much broader than similar protections provided by other participants in the payments industry. As a result, merchants may incur losses for chargebacks and other claims on certain transactions when using other payments providers that the merchants would not incur if they used our payments services. We also provide consumer protection against losses on qualifying purchases and accept claims for review up to 180 days post-transaction. We believe that this protection is generally consistent with, or better than, that offered by other payments providers. These programs are designed to promote confidence on both the part of consumers, who will only be required to pay if they receive their purchased item or service in the condition significantly as described, and merchants, who will receive payment for the product or service they deliver to the customer.Our ability to protect both merchants and consumers is based largely on our proprietary, end-to-end Payments Platform and our ability to leverage the data from both sides of transactions on our two-sided network specifically from buyers and sellers and from senders and receivers of payments. We believe mobile devices will continue to play a significant and increasing role in commerce, including by creating the opportunities to make our ecosystem safer. For example, PayPal uses data from mobile devices and growing protection for the mobile operating environment to reduce financial and fraud risk to merchants and consumers. Our ongoing investment in systems and processes designed to enhance the safety and security of our products reflects our goal of having PayPal recognized as one of the world’s most trusted payments brands. 8 Table of Contents Competition The global payments industry is highly competitive, rapidly changing, highly innovative, and increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny and oversight. We compete against a wide range of businesses, including those that are larger than we are, have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, or a dominant or more secure position, or offer other products and services to consumers and merchants that we do not offer, as well as smaller or younger companies that may be more agile in responding quickly to regulatory and technological changes. Many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Competition also may intensify as businesses enter into business combinations and partnerships, and established companies in other segments expand to become competitive with different aspects of our business.We compete primarily on the basis of the following:•ability to attract, retain, and engage both merchants and consumers on our Payments Platform;•ability to demonstrate to merchants that they may achieve incremental sales by using and offering our services to consumers;•consumer confidence in the safety and security of transactions on our Payments Platform, including the ability for consumers to use our products and services without sharing their financial information with the merchant or any other party they are paying;•simplicity and transparency of our fee structure;•ability to develop products and services across multiple commerce channels, including e-commerce, mobile, and payments at the point of sale;•trust in our dispute resolution and buyer and seller protection programs;•customer service experience;•brand recognition and preference;•website, mobile platform, and application onboarding, ease-of-use, speed, availability, and dependability;•ability of our Payments Platform to support across technologies and payment methods;•system reliability and data security;•ability to assist merchants in complying with payments-related laws and regulations;•ease and quality of integration into third-party mobile applications and operating systems; and•quality of developer tools, such as our application programming interfaces and software development kits.In addition to the discussion in this section, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” under the caption “We face substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry” for further discussion of the potential impact of competition on our business. Research and Development Total research and development expense was $1.1 billion, $1.1 billion and $953 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Intellectual Property The protection of our intellectual property, including our trademarks, patents, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, and trade secrets is important to the success of our business. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on applicable laws and regulations in the U.S. and internationally, as well as a variety of administrative procedures. We have registered our core brands as domain names and as trademarks in the U.S. and a large number of other jurisdictions. We also have in place an active program to continue to secure and enforce trademarks and domain names that corresponds to our brands in markets of interest. We have filed patent applications in the U.S. and in international jurisdictions covering certain aspects of our proprietary technology and new innovations. We also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights when offering or procuring products and services. We have routinely entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and non-disclosure agreements with parties with whom we conduct business to control access to, and use and disclosure of, our proprietary information.For additional information regarding some of the risks relating to our intellectual property, including costs of protecting our intellectual property, see the information in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” under the captions “We are subject to patent litigation” and “We may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or third parties may allege that we are infringing their intellectual property rights.” 9 Table of Contents Government Regulation We operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened regulatory focus on all aspects of the payments industry. That focus continues to become even more heightened as regulators on a global basis focus on such important issues as countering terrorist financing, anti-money laundering, privacy, cybersecurity, and consumer protection. Some of the laws and regulations to which we are subject were enacted recently, and the laws and regulations applicable to us, including those enacted prior to the advent of digital and mobile payments, are continuing to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation. New or changing laws and regulations, including how such laws and regulations are interpreted and implemented, as well as increased penalties and enforcement actions related to non-compliance, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Therefore, we monitor these areas closely to design compliant solutions for our customers who depend on us.Government regulation impacts key aspects of our business. We are subject to regulations that affect the payments industry in the markets we operate.Payments Regulation. Various laws and regulations govern the payments industry in the U.S. and internationally. In the U.S., PayPal, Inc. holds licenses to operate as a money transmitter (or its equivalent), which, among other things, subjects PayPal, Inc. to reporting requirements, bonding requirements, limitations on the investment of customer funds, and inspection by state regulatory agencies. Outside the U.S., we provide similar services customized for various countries and foreign jurisdictions through our foreign subsidiaries. The activities of those non-U.S. entities are, or may be, supervised by a financial regulatory authority in the jurisdictions in which they operate. Among other regulatory authorities, the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (the “CSSF”), the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Reserve Bank of India, the Central Bank of Russia, the Central Bank of Brazil, and the People's Bank of China have asserted jurisdiction over some or all of our activities in their respective jurisdictions. This list is not exhaustive, and there are numerous other regulatory agencies that have or may assert jurisdiction over our activities. The laws and regulations applicable to the payments industry in any given jurisdiction are subject to interpretation and change.Banking Agency Supervision. We serve our customers in the European Union (“EU”) through PayPal (Europe) S.à.r.l. et Cie, SCA, a wholly-owned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a bank in Luxembourg by the CSSF. Consequently, we must comply with rules and regulations of the European banking industry, including those related to capitalization, funds management, corporate governance, anti-money laundering, disclosure, reporting, and inspection. We are, or may be, subject to banking-related regulations in other countries now or in the future related to our role in the financial industry. In addition, based on our relationships with our partner financial institutions, we are, or may be, subject to indirect regulation and examination by these financial institutions’ regulators.Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) has significant authority to regulate consumer financial products in the U.S., including consumer credit, deposits, payments, and similar products. As a large market participant of remittance transfers, the CFPB has direct supervisory authority over our business. The CFPB and other similar regulatory agencies in other jurisdictions may have broad consumer protection mandates that could result in the promulgation and interpretation of rules and regulations that may affect our business.Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing. PayPal is subject to anti-money laundering (“AML”) laws and regulations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, as well as laws designed to prevent the use of the financial systems to facilitate terrorist activities. Our AML program is designed to prevent our payment network from being used to facilitate money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit activities, or to do business in countries or with persons and entities included on designated country or person lists promulgated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls (“OFAC”) and equivalent authorities in other countries. Our AML and sanctions compliance programs, overseen by our AML/Bank Secrecy Act Officer, is composed of policies, procedures, and internal controls, and is designed to address these legal and regulatory requirements and assist in managing money laundering and terrorist financing risks.Interchange Fees. Interchange fees associated with four-party payments systems are being reviewed or challenged in various jurisdictions. For example, in the EU, the Multilateral Interchange Fee (“MIF”) Regulation caps interchange fees for credit and debit card payments and provides for business rules to be complied with by any company dealing with card transactions, including PayPal. As a result, the fees that we collect in certain jurisdictions may become the subject of regulatory challenge.Data Protection and Information Security. Aspects of our operations or business are subject to privacy and data protection regulation in the U.S., the EU, Asia Pacific, and elsewhere. For example, the EU adopted a comprehensive General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), which came into effect in May 2018. GDPR expanded the scope of the EU data protection law to foreign companies processing personal data of European Economic Area (“EEA”) individuals and imposed a stricter data protection compliance regime. In the U.S., we are subject to privacy and information safeguarding requirements under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the California Consumer Privacy Act that require similar privacy protections afforded by the GDPR, as well as the maintenance of a written, comprehensive information security program. In Europe, the operations of our Luxembourg bank are subject to confidentiality and information safeguarding requirements under the Luxembourg Banking Act. Regulatory authorities around the world are considering numerous legislative and regulatory proposals concerning privacy and data protection that may contain additional privacy and data protection obligations. In addition, the interpretation and application of these privacy and data protection laws in the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere are often uncertain and in a state of flux.Anti-Corruption. PayPal is subject to applicable anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar anti-corruption laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Anti-corruption laws generally prohibit offering, promising, giving, accepting, or authorizing others to provide anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to or from a government official or private party in order to influence official action or otherwise gain an unfair business advantage, such as to obtain or retain business. We have implemented policies, procedures, and internal controls that are designed to comply with these laws and regulations.Additional Regulatory Developments. Various regulatory agencies continue to examine a wide variety of issues, including virtual currencies, identity theft, account management guidelines, privacy, disclosure rules, cybersecurity, and marketing, that may impact PayPal’s business.For an additional discussion on governmental regulation affecting our business, please see the risk factors related to regulation of our payments business and regulation in the areas of consumer privacy, data use, and/or security in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” under the caption “Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business, Results of Operations, and Financial Condition” and “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 10 Table of Contents Seasonality The Company does not experience meaningful seasonality with respect to net revenues. No individual quarter in 2019, 2018 or 2017 accounted for more than 30% of annual net revenue. Employees As of December 31, 2019, we employed approximately 23,200 people globally, of whom approximately 11,200 were located in the U.S. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. Separation from eBay Inc. PayPal Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in January 2015 for the purpose of owning and operating eBay’s Payments business in connection with the separation and distribution described below. eBay completed the transfer of substantially all of the assets, liabilities, and operations of eBay’s Payments business to PayPal in June 2015. Prior to the contribution of the Payments business, PayPal Holdings, Inc. had no operations. On July 17, 2015 (the “distribution date”), PayPal became an independent publicly traded company through the pro rata distribution by eBay of 100% of the outstanding common stock of PayPal to eBay stockholders (which we refer to as the “separation” or the “distribution”). Each eBay stockholder of record as of the close of business on July 8, 2015 received one share of PayPal common stock for every share of eBay common stock held on the record date. Approximately 1.2 billion shares of PayPal common stock were distributed on July 17, 2015 to eBay stockholders. PayPal’s common stock began “regular way” trading under the ticker symbol “PYPL” on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on July 20, 2015. 11 Table of Contents Available Information The address of our principal executive offices is PayPal Holdings, Inc., 2211 North First Street, San Jose, California 95131.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The following discussion is divided into three sections. The first section, which begins immediately following this paragraph, discusses some of the risks that may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. The second section, captioned “Risks Related to Our Separation from eBay” discusses some of the risks relating to our separation from eBay in July 2015 into an independent publicly traded company. The third section, captioned “Risks Related to Our Common Stock,” discusses some of the risks relating to an investment in our Common Stock. You should carefully review all of these sections in addition to the other information appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, for important information regarding risks and uncertainties that affect us. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business, Results of Operations, and Financial Condition We face substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry. The global payments industry is highly competitive, rapidly changing, highly innovative, and increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny and oversight. We compete against a wide range of businesses, including those that are larger than we are, have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, or a dominant or more secure position, or offer other products and services to consumers and merchants that we do not offer, as well as smaller or younger companies that may be more agile in responding quickly to regulatory and technological changes. Many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Competition also may intensify as businesses enter into business combinations and partnerships, and established companies in other segments expand to become competitive with different aspects of our business.We compete primarily on the basis of the following:•ability to attract, retain, and engage both merchants and consumers on our Payments Platform;•ability to demonstrate to merchants that they may achieve incremental sales by using and offering our services to consumers;•consumer confidence in the safety and security of transactions on our Payments Platform, including the ability for consumers to use our products and services without sharing their financial information with the merchant or any other party they are paying;•simplicity and transparency of our fee structure;•ability to develop products and services across multiple commerce channels, including e-commerce, mobile, and payments at the point of sale;•trust in our dispute resolution and buyer and seller protection programs;•customer service experience;•brand recognition and preference;•website, mobile platform, and application onboarding, ease-of-use, speed, availability, and dependability;•ability of our Payments Platform to support across technologies and payment methods;•system reliability and data security;•ability to assist merchants in complying with payments-related laws and regulations;•ease and quality of integration into third-party mobile applications and operating systems; and•quality of developer tools, such as our application programming interfaces and software development kits.We compete against a wide range of businesses with varying roles in all forms of payments, including:•paper-based transactions (principally cash and checks);•banks and financial institutions providing traditional payment methods, particularly credit and debit cards (collectively, “payment cards”) and electronic bank transfers;•payment networks which facilitate payments for credit card users;•providers of “digital wallets” which offer customers the ability to pay online and/or in-store through a variety of payment methods, including with mobile applications, through contactless payments, and with a variety of payment cards;•providers of mobile payments solutions that use tokenized card data approaches and contactless payments (e.g., near field communication (“NFC”) or host card emulation functionality) to eliminate the need to swipe or insert a card or enter a personal identification number or password;•payment-card processors that offer their services to merchants, including for “card on file” payments where the merchant invites the consumer to select a payment method for their first transaction and to use the same payment method for subsequent transactions;•providers of person-to-person (“P2P”) payments that facilitate individuals sending money with an email address or mobile phone number;•merchants and merchant associations that may provide proprietary payment networks to facilitate payments within their own retail network;•providers of money remittance services for transferring money abroad, including those that may provide proprietary payment networks;•providers of card readers for mobile devices and of other point-of-sale and multi-channel technologies; and•providers of virtual currencies and distributed ledger technologies.We often partner with many of these businesses and we consider the ability to continue establishing these partnerships as important to our business. Competition for relationships with these partners is intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to establish, grow, or maintain these partner relationships.We also face competition and potential competition from:•services that provide online merchants the option of paying for purchases from their bank account or paying on credit;•issuers of stored value products targeted at online payments;•other online and mobile payment-services providers globally;•services targeting users of social networks and online gaming, including those offering social commerce and P2P payments;•payment services enabling banking customers to send and receive payments through their bank account, including through immediate or real-time payments systems;•e-commerce services that provide special offers linked to a specific payment provider; •services that help merchants and consumers use, accept, buy, sell, and manage virtual currencies; and•electronic funds transfer services as a method of payment for both online and offline transactions.Some of our current and potential competitors have larger customer bases, broader geographic scope, volume, scale, resources, and market share than we do, which may provide them significant competitive advantages. Some competitors may also be subject to less burdensome licensing, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, and other regulatory requirements. They may devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of products and services, and offer lower prices or more effectively offer their own innovative programs, products, and services.If we are not able to differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors, drive value for our customers, or effectively and efficiently align our resources with our goals and objectives, we may not be able to compete effectively in the market. 12 Table of Contents 13 Table of Contents Substantially all of our net revenues each quarter come primarily from transactions involving payments during that quarter, which may result in significant fluctuations in our operating results that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, as well as the trading price of our common stock. Substantially all of our net revenues each quarter come primarily from transactions involving payments during that quarter. As a result, our operating and financial results have varied on a quarterly basis during our operating history and may continue to fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including the risks set forth in this “Risk Factors” section. It is difficult for us to forecast accurately the level or source of our revenues or earnings. In view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful, and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance. Due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting revenues, it is also difficult to forecast expenses. Quarterly and annual expenses reflected in our financial statements may be significantly different from historical or projected rates. Our operating results in one or more future quarters may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. The trading price of our common stock may decline significantly as a result of the factors described in this paragraph. Global and regional economic conditions could harm our business. Our operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions. Uncertainty about global and regional economic events and conditions may result in consumers and businesses postponing or lowering spending in response to, among other factors:•tighter credit, •higher unemployment, •consumer debt levels or reduced consumer confidence,•financial market volatility, •fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, •changes and uncertainties related to government fiscal and tax policies,•changes and uncertainties about U.S and international trade relationships, agreements, policies, treaties and restrictive actions, as well as the possibility of significant increases in tariffs on imported goods, and other restrictive actions,•the inability of the U.S. Congress to enact a budget in a fiscal year, a sequestration, and/or another shutdown of the U.S. government,•government austerity programs, and •other negative financial news or macroeconomic developments.These and other global and regional economic events and conditions, including Brexit, could have a material adverse impact on the demand for our products and services, including a reduction in the volume and size of transactions on our Payments Platform. In addition, any financial turmoil affecting the banking system or financial markets could cause additional consolidation of the financial services industry, significant failures of financial service institutions, new or incremental tightening in the credit markets, low liquidity, and extreme volatility or distress in the fixed income, credit, currency, and equity markets, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. See also the risk factor captioned, “The United Kingdom's departure from the EU could adversely affect us.” If we cannot keep pace with rapid technological developments to provide new and innovative products and services, the use of our products and services and, consequently, our revenues could decline. Rapid, significant, and disruptive technological changes impact the industries in which we operate, including developments in: •technologies supporting our regulatory and compliance obligations (e.g., in relation to our know your customer (“KYC”) and customer identification program (“CIP”) obligations under anti-money laundering regulations); •artificial intelligence and machine learning (e.g., in relation to fraud and risk decisioning);•payment technologies (e.g., real time payments, payment card tokenization, virtual currencies, including distributed ledger and blockchain technologies, and proximity payment technology, such as NFC and other contactless payments); •technologies (e.g., internet browser technology, that enable users to easily store their payment card information for use on any retail or e-commerce website; and•commerce technologies, including in-store, online, mobile, virtual, and social commerce (i.e., ecommerce through social networks).As a result, we expect new services and technologies to continue to emerge and evolve, and we cannot predict the effects of technological changes on our business. In addition to our own initiatives and innovations, we rely in part on third parties, including some of our competitors, for the development of and access to new or evolving technologies. These third parties may restrict or prevent our access to, or utilization of, those technologies, as well as their platforms or products. In addition, we may not be able to accurately predict which technological developments or innovations will become widely adopted and how those technologies may be regulated. We expect that new services and technologies applicable to the industries in which we operate will continue to emerge and may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies we currently use in our products and services. Developing and incorporating new technologies into our products and services may require substantial expenditures, take considerable time, and ultimately may not be successful. In addition, our ability to adopt new products and services and to develop new technologies may be inhibited by industry-wide standards, platform providers, payments networks, changes to laws and regulations, the extent of changing expectations of consumers or merchants, third-party intellectual property rights, or other factors. Our success will depend on our ability to develop and incorporate new technologies and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards; if we are unable to do so in a timely or cost-effective manner, our business could be harmed. 14 Table of Contents Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to our reputation, business, and financial condition. Our business involves the collection, storage, processing, and transmission of confidential information and customers’ personal data, including financial information and information about how they interact with our Payments Platform. We have built our reputation on the premise that our Payments Platform offers customers a more secure way to make payments. An increasing number of organizations, including large merchants, businesses, technology companies, and financial institutions, as well as government institutions, have disclosed breaches of their information security systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks, including on their websites, mobile applications, and infrastructure.The techniques used to obtain unauthorized, improper, or illegal access to systems and information (including customers’ personal data), disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and have become increasingly complex and sophisticated, may be difficult to detect quickly, and often are not recognized or detected until after they have been launched against a target. Unauthorized parties have attempted, and we expect that they will continue to attempt, to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means, including, but not limited to, hacking into our systems or facilities or those of our customers, partners, or vendors, and attempting to fraudulently induce users of our systems (including employees and our customers) into disclosing user names, passwords, payment card information, or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems. Threats can come from a variety of sources, including criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage, and insider threats. Certain efforts may be supported by significant financial and technological resources, making them even more sophisticated and difficult to detect. Numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats, including advanced and persisting cyberattacks, cyberextortion, spear phishing and social engineering schemes, the introduction of computer viruses or other malware, and the physical destruction of all or portions of our information technology and infrastructure could compromise the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the data in our systems. We believe that PayPal is a particularly attractive target for such breaches and attacks due to our name and brand recognition and the widespread adoption and use of our products and services. Although we have developed systems and processes designed to protect data we manage, prevent data loss and other security breaches and effectively respond to known and potential risks, and expect to continue to expend significant resources to bolster these protections, there can be no assurance that these security measures will provide absolute security or prevent breaches or attacks. Our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyberattacks or security breaches, and third parties may be able to access our customers’ personal or proprietary information and payment card data that are stored on or accessible through those systems. We have experienced from time to time, and may experience in the future, breaches of our security measures due to human error, malfeasance, insider threats, system errors or vulnerabilities, or other irregularities. Actual or perceived breaches of our security could, among other things:•interrupt our operations, •result in our systems or services being unavailable, •result in improper disclosure of data and violations of applicable privacy and other laws,•materially harm our reputation and brands, •result in significant regulatory scrutiny, investigations, fines, penalties and other legal and financial exposure, •cause us to incur significant remediation costs, •lead to loss of customer confidence in, or decreased use of, our products and services, •divert the attention of management from the operation of our business, •result in significant compensation or contractual penalties from us to our customers and their business partners as a result of losses to them or claims by them, and •adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, any cyberattacks or data security breaches affecting the information technology or infrastructure of companies we acquire or of our customers, partners, or vendors (including data center and cloud computing providers) could have similar negative effects. See Note 4—“Business Combinations,” Note 5—“Goodwill and Intangible Assets” and Note 13—“Commitments and Contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements for disclosure relating to the suspension of operations of TIO Networks (“TIO”) (which we acquired in July 2017) as part of an investigation of security vulnerabilities of the TIO platform. Actual or perceived vulnerabilities or data breaches have led and may lead to claims against us. In addition, under payment card rules and our contracts with our card processors, if there is a breach of payment card information that we store, or that is stored by our direct payment card processing vendors, we could be liable to the payment card issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses. We also expect to expend significant additional resources to protect against security or privacy breaches and may be required to redress problems caused by breaches. Financial services regulators in various jurisdictions, including the U.S. and the EU, have implemented authentication requirements for banks and payment processors intended to reduce online fraud, which could impose significant costs, require us to change our business practices, make it more difficult for new customers to join PayPal, and reduce the ease of use of our products, which could harm our business. While we maintain insurance policies, they may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches. 15 Table of Contents Systems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our websites, applications, products, or services could harm our business. Our systems and those of our service providers and partners have experienced from time to time, and may experience in the future service interruptions or degradation because of hardware and software defects or malfunctions, distributed denial-of-service and other cyberattacks, insider threats, human error, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, and other natural disasters, power losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist attacks, computer viruses or other malware, or other events. We have experienced from time to time, and may experience in the future, disruptions in our systems due to break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism. Some of our systems, including systems of companies we have acquired, are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all possible outcomes or events. In addition, as a provider of payments solutions, we are subject to heightened scrutiny by regulators that may require specific business continuity, resiliency and disaster recovery plans, and more rigorous testing of such plans, which may be costly and time-consuming to implement, and may divert our resources from other business priorities.We have experienced and expect to continue to experience system failures, denial-of-service attacks, and other events or conditions from time to time that interrupt the availability, or reduce or adversely affect the speed or functionality, of our products and services. These events have resulted and likely will result in loss of revenue. A prolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in the availability, speed, or functionality of our products and services could materially harm our business. Frequent or persistent interruptions in our services could cause current or potential customers or partners to believe that our systems are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid or reduce the use of our products and services, and could permanently harm our reputation and brands. Moreover, if any system failure or similar event results in damages to our customers or their business partners, these customers or partners could seek significant compensation or contractual penalties from us for their losses, and those claims, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and costly for us to address, and could have other consequences described in this “Risk Factors” section under the caption “Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to our reputation, business, and financial condition.”Our Payments Platform has experienced and may in the future experience intermittent unavailability. The full-time availability and expeditious delivery of our products and services is critical to our goal of gaining widespread acceptance among consumers and merchants for digital payments. We have undertaken and continue to undertake certain system upgrades and re-platforming efforts designed to improve our reliability and speed. These efforts are costly and time-consuming, involve significant technical risk and may divert our resources from new features and products, and there can be no guarantee that these efforts will succeed. Because we are a regulated financial institution in certain jurisdictions, frequent or persistent site interruptions could lead to regulatory scrutiny, significant fines and penalties, and mandatory and costly changes to our business practices, and ultimately could cause us to lose existing licenses that we need to operate or prevent or delay us from obtaining additional licenses that may be required for our business.We also rely on facilities, components, applications, and services supplied by third parties, including data center facilities and cloud storage services, which subjects us to risks in the nature of those discussed in this “Risk Factors” section under the captions “We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk.” From time to time, such third parties have ceased to provide us with such facilities and services. Additionally, if these third parties experience operational interference or disruptions, breach their agreements with us, fail to perform their obligations and meet our expectations, or experience a cybersecurity incident, our operations could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected, which could result in customer dissatisfaction, regulatory scrutiny, and damage to our reputation and brands, and materially and adversely affect our business. While we maintain business interruption insurance, our coverage may be insufficient to compensate us for all losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of systems failures and similar events.In addition, we are continually improving and upgrading our information systems and technologies. Implementation of new systems and technologies is complex, expensive, and time-consuming. If we fail to timely and successfully implement new information systems and technologies, or improvements or upgrades to existing information systems and technologies, or if such systems and technologies do not operate as intended, this could have an adverse impact on our business, internal controls (including internal controls over financial reporting), results of operations, and financial condition. 16 Table of Contents Changes to payment card networks or bank fees, rules, or practices could harm our business. We rely on banks or other payment processors to process transactions and pay fees for their services. From time to time, payment card networks have increased, and may continue to increase in the future, the interchange fees and assessments that they charge for transactions that access their networks. Payment card networks have imposed, and may impose in the future, special fees or assessments for transactions that are executed through a digital wallet such as PayPal’s, which could negatively impact us and significantly increase our costs. Our payment card processors may have the right to pass any increases in interchange fees and assessments on to us as well as increase their own fees for processing, which could increase our operating costs and reduce our operating income. We have entered into strategic partnerships with Visa, Mastercard and other credit card networks to further expand our relationships in a way that will make it easier for merchants to accept and consumers to choose to pay with their respective credit cards and debit cards. During the terms of these agreements, Visa and Mastercard have each agreed to not enact or impose any fees or rules that solely target PayPal. Upon termination of the agreements, PayPal could become subject to special digital wallet fees or other special assessments.In addition, in some jurisdictions, government regulations have required payment card networks to reduce or cap interchange fees. Any material change in credit card or debit card interchange rates in the U.S. or other markets, including as a result of changes in interchange fee limitations, could adversely affect our competitive position against traditional payment card service providers and our business, as well as the revenue we earn from our card programs.We are required to comply with payment card network operating rules, including special operating rules for payment service providers to merchants. We have agreed to reimburse our processors for any fines they are assessed by payment card networks resulting from any rule violations by us or our merchants. We may also be directly liable to the payment card networks for rule violations. The payment card networks set and interpret the card operating rules and have alleged from time to time that various aspects of our business model violate these operating rules. If such allegations are not resolved favorably, they may result in significant fines and penalties or require changes in our business practices that may be costly and adversely affect our business. The payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or re-interpret existing rules that we or our processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow, or costly to implement. As a result, we could lose our ability to give consumers the option of using payment cards to fund their payments or the choice of currency in which they would like their payment card to be charged. If we are unable to accept payment cards or are limited in our ability to do so, our business would be adversely affected.We and our payment card processors have implemented specific business processes for merchants to comply with payment card network operating rules for providing services to merchants. Any failure to comply with these rules could result in fines. We are also subject to fines from payment card networks if we fail to detect that merchants are engaging in activities that are illegal or considered “high risk” under their network operating rules, including the sale of certain types of digital content. For “high risk” merchants, we must either prevent such merchants from using PayPal services or register such merchants with the payment card networks and conduct additional monitoring with respect to such merchants. Although the amount of these fines has not been material to date, we could be subject to significant additional fines in the future, which could result in a termination of our ability to accept payment cards or require changes in our process for registering new customers, which would adversely affect our business. Payment card network rules may also increase the cost of, impose restrictions on, or otherwise negatively impact the development of, our retail point-of-sale solutions, which may negatively impact their deployment and adoption. 17 Table of Contents Failure to deal effectively with fraud, fictitious transactions, bad transactions, and negative customer experiences would increase our loss rate and could negatively impact our business and severely diminish merchant and consumer confidence in and use of our services. Our operations process a significant volume and dollar value of transactions on a daily basis. In the event that merchants do not fulfill their obligations to consumers or a merchant's goods or services do not match the merchant’s description, we may incur substantial losses as a result of claims from consumers. We seek to recover such losses from the merchant but we may not fully recover them if the merchant is unwilling or unable to pay. In addition, in the event of the bankruptcy or other business interruption of a merchant that sells goods or services in advance of the date of their delivery or use (e.g., airline, cruise or concert tickets, custom-made goods, and subscriptions), we could be liable to the buyers of such goods or services, either through our buyer protection program or through chargebacks on payment cards used by customers to fund their payments. While we have established allowances for transaction losses based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such losses incurred as of the reporting date, these reserves may be insufficient.We also incur substantial losses from claims that the consumer did not authorize the purchase, fraud, erroneous transactions, and customers who have closed bank accounts or have insufficient funds in their bank accounts to satisfy payments. In addition, if losses incurred by us related to payment card transactions become excessive, they could potentially result in our losing the right to accept payment cards for payment, which would negatively impact our business. We have taken measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud, but these measures require continuous improvement and may not be effective in detecting and preventing fraud, particularly new and continually evolving forms of fraud or in connection with new or expanded product offerings. If these measures do not succeed, our business could be negatively impacted. We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that could materially and adversely affect our financial results. We have significant operations internationally that are denominated in foreign currencies, including the British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar, and Canadian Dollar, which subject us to foreign currency exchange risk. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar versus these foreign currencies impacts the translation of our net revenues generated and expenses incurred in these foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar. In connection with providing our services in multiple currencies, we may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign currency exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the times that we set them. We also hold a portion of our corporate and customer funds in non-U.S. currencies, and our financial results are affected by the remeasurement of these non-U.S. currencies into U.S. dollars. We also have foreign currency exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. While we regularly enter into transactions to hedge foreign currency exchange risk for portions of our foreign currency translation and balance sheet exposure, it is impossible to predict or entirely eliminate the effects of this exposure. Any factors that reduce cross-border trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business. Cross-border trade (i.e., transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries) is an important source of our revenue and profits. Cross-border transactions generally provide higher revenues and operating income than similar transactions that take place within a single country or market. Cross-border trade also represents our primary (and in some cases, our only) presence in certain important markets. Cross-border trade is subject to, and may be negatively impacted by, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, the interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions (e.g., the jurisdiction of the merchant and of the consumer) are often extremely complicated in the context of cross-border trade and foreign exchange. Changes to or the interpretation and/or application of laws and regulations applicable to cross-border trade and foreign exchange could impose additional requirements and restrictions, increase costs, and impose conflicting obligations. Any factors that increase the costs of cross-border trade for us or our customers or that restrict, delay, or make cross-border trade more difficult or impractical, such as trade policy or higher tariffs, could reduce our cross-border transactions and volume, negatively impact our revenues and profits and harm our business. See also the risk factor captioned, “Global and regional economic conditions could harm our business.” 18 Table of Contents Changes in how consumers fund their PayPal transactions could harm our business. We pay transaction fees when consumers fund payment transactions using credit cards, lower fees when consumers fund payments with debit cards, and nominal fees when consumers fund payment transactions by electronic transfer of funds from bank accounts, or from an existing PayPal account balance or through our PayPal branded consumer credit products. Our financial success is sensitive to changes in the rate at which our consumers fund payments using payment cards, which can significantly increase our costs. Although we provide consumers in certain markets with the opportunity to use their existing PayPal account balance to fund payment transactions, some of our consumers may prefer to use payment cards, especially if these payment cards offer features and benefits that are not provided as part of their PayPal accounts. An increase in the portion of our payment volume funded using payment cards or in fees associated with our funding mix, or other events or developments that make it more difficult or costly for us to fund transactions with lower-cost funding options, could materially and adversely affect our financial performance and significantly harm our business.We have entered into strategic partnerships with major payment card networks and/or issuing banks to promote greater consumer choice and make it easier for merchants to accept and consumers to pay with these partners’ credit cards and/or debit cards and to allow us to gain access to these partners’ tokenization services for in-store point of sale PayPal transactions. These arrangements may have an uncertain impact on our business. While we anticipate that these and similar strategic partnerships we may enter into in the future will result in an increase in the number of transactions and transaction volume that we process, we also anticipate that a greater percentage of customer transactions will be executed using a payment card, which would likely increase the transaction costs associated with our funding mix, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and profitability. The United Kingdom’s departure from the EU could adversely affect us. The United Kingdom (“U.K.”) held a referendum in June 2016 in which a majority of voters approved an exit from the European Union (“EU”) (commonly referred to as “Brexit”). The U.K. formally exited the EU on January 31, 2020 and a transition period is in place until December 31, 2020 during which time the U.K. will remain in both the EU customs union and single market and follow EU rules. There is a significant lack of clarity over the terms of the U.K.'s future relationship with the EU after this date. Brexit could therefore adversely affect U.K., regional (including European), and worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign currency exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the British Pound and Euro, which in turn could adversely affect us or our customers and companies with which we do business, particularly in the U.K. Brexit could lead to greater restrictions on the supply and availability of goods and services between the U.K. and the EEA region, with the potential inability of U.K. companies to fulfill orders which could lead to a risk of increased merchant defaults and buyer protection claims. Brexit could also trigger a general deterioration in credit conditions, a downturn in consumer sentiment, and overall negative economic growth. Any of these scenarios could have an adverse effect on our business or our customers.In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and increased complexity for financial services firms as national laws and regulations in the U.K. start to diverge from EU laws and regulations. In particular, depending on the terms of Brexit, we may face new regulatory costs and challenges, including the following:•if we are unable to utilize appropriate authorizations and regulatory permissions, our European operations could lose their ability to offer services into the U.K. market on a cross-border basis and for our U.K. based operations to offer services on a cross-border basis in the European markets. For example, our ability to work primarily with the Luxembourg regulator as the lead authority for various aspects of the U.K. operations of PayPal (Europe) S.à.r.l. et Cie., SCA (“PayPal (Europe)”) and with the Swedish regulator for various aspects of the U.K. operations of iZettle AB (“iZettle”) may be impacted; •we could be required to obtain additional regulatory permissions to operate in the U.K. market, adding costs and potential inconsistency to our business. Depending on the capacity of the U.K. authorities, the criteria for obtaining permission, and any possible transitional arrangements, our business in the U.K. could be materially affected or disrupted; •we could be required to comply with legal and regulatory requirements in the U.K. that are in addition to, or inconsistent with, those of the EU, leading to increased complexity and costs for our European and U.K. operations; and•our ability to attract and retain the necessary human resources in appropriate locations to support our U.K. and European business could be adversely impacted.These and other factors related to Brexit could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 19 Table of Contents Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight. Our failure to comply with extensive, complex, overlapping, and frequently changing rules, regulations, and legal interpretations could materially harm our business. Our business is subject to laws, rules, regulations, policies, and legal interpretations in the markets in which we operate, including, but not limited to, those governing:•banking, •credit, •deposit taking, •cross-border and domestic money transmission, •prepaid access, •foreign currency exchange, •privacy, •data governance,•data protection, •cybersecurity, •banking secrecy, •fraud detection,•payment services (including payment processing and settlement services), •consumer protection, •antitrust and competition,•economic and trade sanctions, •anti-money laundering, and •counter-terrorist financing. Our success and increased visibility may result in increased regulatory oversight and enforcement and more restrictive rules and regulations that apply to our business.As we expand and localize our international activities, we have become increasingly obligated to comply with the laws of the markets in which we operate. In addition, because our services are accessible worldwide and we facilitate sales of goods and provide services to customers worldwide, one or more jurisdictions may claim that we or our customers are required to comply with their laws. Laws regulating the internet, mobile, and related technologies outside of the U.S. often impose different, more specific, or even conflicting obligations on us, as well as broader liability. For example, certain transactions that may be permissible in a local jurisdiction may be prohibited by regulations of U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) or U.S. anti-money laundering or counter-terrorist financing regulations.Any failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or new laws, regulations, or orders of any government authority (including changes to or expansion of the interpretation of those laws, regulations, or orders), including those discussed in this risk factor, may subject us to significant fines, penalties, criminal and civil lawsuits, forfeiture of significant assets, and enforcement actions in one or more jurisdictions; result in additional compliance and licensure requirements; cause us to lose existing licenses or prevent or delay us from obtaining additional licenses that may be required for our business; increase regulatory scrutiny of our business; restrict our operations; and force us to change our business practices, make product or operational changes, or delay planned transactions, product launches or improvements. Any of the foregoing could, individually or in the aggregate, harm our reputation, damage our brands and business, and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The complexity of U.S. federal and state and international regulatory and enforcement regimes, coupled with the global scope of our operations and the evolving global regulatory environment, could result in a single event prompting a large number of overlapping investigations and legal and regulatory proceedings by multiple government authorities in different jurisdictions. We have implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, and agents will not violate such laws and regulations. 20 Table of Contents Payments Regulation In the U.S., PayPal, Inc. has obtained licenses to operate as a money transmitter (or its equivalent) in the states where such licenses are required, as well as in the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. These licenses include not only the PayPal branded products and services in these states, but also our Braintree, Venmo, and Xoom products and services. We may also maintain such licenses for certain companies that we have acquired, such as Hyperwallet. As a licensed money transmitter, PayPal is subject to, among other requirements, restrictions with respect to the investment of customer funds, reporting requirements, bonding requirements, and inspection by state regulatory agencies. Accordingly, if we violate these laws or regulations, we could be subject to liability and/or additional restrictions, forced to cease doing business with residents of certain states, forced to change our business practices, or required to obtain additional licenses or regulatory approvals, which could impose substantial costs.While we currently allow our customers with payment cards to send payments from approximately 200 markets, we allow customers in only approximately half of those markets (including the U.S.) to also receive payments, in some cases with significant restrictions on the manner in which customers can hold balances or withdraw funds. These limitations may adversely affect our ability to grow our business in these markets.We principally provide our services to customers in the EU through PayPal (Europe), our wholly-owned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a credit institution in Luxembourg. Accordingly, PayPal (Europe) is potentially subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if it violates the disclosure, reporting, anti-money laundering, capitalization, corporate governance, privacy, data protection, data governance, information security, banking secrecy, taxation, risk management, sanctions, or other requirements imposed on Luxembourg credit institutions. In addition, EU laws and regulations are subject to potentially inconsistent interpretations by the countries that are members of the EU, which can make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage. Moreover, the countries that are EU members may each have different and potentially inconsistent domestic regulations implementing European Directives, which could make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage. The Revised Payment Services Directive (“PSD2”) took effect in Europe in 2018, with certain requirements becoming applicable from 2019 or later. PSD2 enables new payment and information sharing models whereby regulated payment providers are able to access bank and payment accounts (including PayPal accounts) for the purposes of accessing account information or initiating a payment on behalf of a customer. Such access could subject us to data security and other legal and financial risks and could create new competitive forces and new types of competitors in the European payments market. PSD2 also imposes new standards for payment security and strong customer authentication (“SCA”) that may make it more difficult and time consuming to carry out a PayPal transaction, which may adversely impact PayPal’s European customer value proposition. SCA was implemented in 2019. In line with an opinion issued by the European Banking Authority (“EBA”), national competent authorities (including Luxembourg) have announced enforcement deferral periods for migration to SCA requirements for e-commerce card-based transactions. PayPal (Europe) has implemented SCA customer processes covering the majority of payment transactions initiated within the EU and has plans to finalize full compliance with SCA; amending or accelerating these plans may adversely impact PayPal’s European customer value proposition.If the business activities of PayPal (Europe) exceed certain thresholds, or if the European Central Bank (“ECB”) so determines, PayPal (Europe) may be deemed a significant supervised entity such that some activity of PayPal (Europe) could become directly regulated by the ECB rather than the CSSF, the Luxembourg regulator , as its national supervisor, which could subject us to additional requirements and would likely increase compliance costs.In many of the other markets outside the U.S. in which we do business, we serve our customers through PayPal Pte. Ltd., our wholly-owned subsidiary based in Singapore. PayPal Pte. Ltd. is supervised by the Monetary Authority of Singapore and designated as a holder of a stored value facility, but does not hold a remittance license. As a result, PayPal Pte. Ltd. is not able to offer outbound remittance payments from Singapore, and can only offer payments for the purchase of goods and services in Singapore. In many of the markets (other than Singapore) served by PayPal Pte. Ltd., it is unclear and uncertain whether our Singapore-based service is subject only to Singapore law or, if it is subject to the application of local laws, whether such local laws would require a payment processor like us to be licensed as a payments service, bank, financial institution, or otherwise. The Payment Services Act (“PS Act”) passed into law in Singapore in January 2019 and is expected to come into effect in 2020. Under the PS Act, PayPal Pte. Ltd. will be required to apply for a license to continue to provide payments services in Singapore. Furthermore, once the PS Act comes into force and is fully implemented, we may face new regulatory costs and challenges, including the following:•we could be required to comply with new regulatory requirements, resulting in increased complexity and costs for our Singapore and international operations;•we could be required to make changes to our compliance program, resulting in increased complexity and costs to operate both in Singapore as well as in the cross-border markets which are served by PayPal Pte. Ltd; and•we could be required to comply with additional safeguarding requirements, which could increase our operational costs.In certain markets outside the U.S. (e.g., Australia), we provide our services to customers through a local subsidiary subject to local regulatory supervision or oversight, which may be the holder of a local payment license, certification, or other authorization. In such markets, we may be subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if we violate applicable reporting, anti-money laundering, capital requirements, privacy, corporate governance, risk management, or any other applicable requirements.PayPal Australia Pty Limited (“PPAU”) self-reported a potential violation to the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (“AUSTRAC”) on May 22, 2019 with respect to the reporting of international funds transfer instructions under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (“AML/CTF Act”). Please see Note 13—Commitments and Contingencies—Litigation and Regulatory Matters—for additional disclosure regarding this matter. From time to time, we may acquire entities subject to local regulatory supervision or oversight. For example, in December 2019, we completed our acquisition of a 70% equity stake in Guofubao Information Technology Co. (GoPay), Ltd. (“GoPay”), a provider of online payment services in China. GoPay holds a number of payment business licenses in China and is subject to regulatory supervision by the People’s Bank of China and other regulatory bodies. We have been, and expect to continue to be, required to apply for various licenses, certifications, and regulatory approvals in a number of the jurisdictions where we provide our services, including due to changes in applicable laws and regulations or the interpretation of such laws and regulations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to (or decide to) obtain any such licenses, certifications, and approvals. In addition, there are substantial costs and potential product changes involved in maintaining and renewing such licenses, certifications, and approvals, and we could be subject to fines, other enforcement action, and litigation if we are found to violate disclosure, reporting, anti-money laundering, capitalization, corporate governance, or other requirements of such licenses. These factors could impose substantial additional costs, involve considerable delay to the development or provision of our products or services, require significant and costly operational changes, or prevent us from providing our products or services in a given market.In many countries, it may not be clear whether we are required to be licensed as a payment services provider, bank, financial institution, or otherwise. In such markets, we may rely on local banks to process payments and conduct foreign currency exchange transactions in local currency. Local regulators may use their authority to slow or halt payments to local merchants conducted through local banks or otherwise prohibit or impede us from doing business in a jurisdiction. Such regulatory actions or the need to obtain licenses, certifications, or other regulatory approvals could impose substantial costs, involve considerable delay to the provision or development of our services, require significant and costly operational changes, impose restrictions, limitations, or additional requirements on our business, or prevent us from providing any products or services in a given market. 21 Table of Contents 22 Table of Contents Consumer Protection We are subject to consumer protection, antitrust and competition-related laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. In the U.S., we are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations applicable to our activities, including the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (“EFTA”) and Regulation E as implemented by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). These regulations require us to provide advance disclosure of changes to our services, follow specified error resolution procedures, and reimburse consumers for losses from certain transactions not authorized by the consumer. Additionally, technical violations of consumer protection laws could result in the assessment of actual damages or statutory damages or penalties of up to $1,000 in individual cases or up to $500,000 per violation in any class action and treble damages in some instances; we could also be liable for plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees in such cases. We are subject to, and have paid amounts in settlement of, lawsuits containing allegations that our business violated the EFTA and Regulation E or otherwise advance claims for relief relating to our business practices (e.g., that we improperly held consumer funds or otherwise improperly limited consumer accounts).The CFPB issued a final rule on prepaid accounts that came into effect on April 1, 2019. The rule’s definition of prepaid account includes certain accounts that are capable of being loaded with funds and whose primary function is to conduct transactions with multiple, unaffiliated merchants, at ATMs and/or for P2P transfers. That definition includes certain digital wallets. The rule’s requirements include, among other things, the disclosure of fees and other information to the consumer prior to the creation of a prepaid account; the extension of Regulation E liability limits and error-resolution requirements to all prepaid accounts; the application of Regulation Z credit card requirements to prepaid accounts with overdraft and credit features; and the submission of prepaid account agreements to the CFPB and their publication to the general public. We have implemented certain changes to comply with the final rule and made substantial changes to the design of certain U.S. consumer accounts and their operability, which could lead to unintended customer confusion and dissatisfaction, discourage customers from opening new accounts, require us to reallocate resources, and increase our costs, which could negatively affect our business. In December 2019, we filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the CFPB challenging the validity of the prepaid account rule as applied to PayPal, Inc. As with any litigation, there is no guarantee that our claims will succeed.In May 2015, we entered into a Stipulated Final Judgment and Consent Order (“Consent Order”) with the CFPB in which we settled regulatory claims arising from PayPal Credit practices between 2011 and 2015. The Consent Order included obligations of PayPal to pay $15 million in redress to consumers and a $10 million civil monetary penalty, and required PayPal to make various changes to PayPal Credit disclosures and related business practices. We continue to cooperate and engage with the CFPB and work to ensure compliance with the Consent Order, which may result in us incurring additional costs.PayPal principally offers its services in EEA countries through a “passport” notification process through the Luxembourg regulator (in the case of PayPal (Europe)) or the Swedish regulator (in the case of iZettle AB) to regulators in other EEA member states in accordance with EU regulations. Regulators in these countries could notify us of local consumer protection laws that apply to our business, in addition to Luxembourg or Swedish consumer protection laws, and could also seek to persuade the local regulator to order PayPal to conduct its activities in the local country directly or through a branch office. Similarly, as a result of Brexit, the U.K. regulators may impose new or different legal requirements on our U.K. business, or require our activities to be conducted locally in the U.K. through a branch office or directly. These or similar actions by these regulators could increase the cost of, or delay, our plans to expand our business in EEA countries. Economic and Trade Sanctions We are required to comply with economic and trade sanctions administered by the U.S, the EU, relevant EU member states, and other jurisdictions in which we operate. We have self-reported to OFAC certain transactions that were inadvertently processed but subsequently identified as possible violations of U.S. economic and trade sanctions. In March 2015, we reached a settlement with OFAC regarding possible violations arising from our sanctions compliance practices between 2009 and 2013, prior to the implementation of our real-time transaction scanning program. Subsequently, we have self-reported additional transactions as possible violations, and we have received new subpoenas from OFAC seeking additional information about certain of these transactions. Such self-reported transactions could result in claims or actions against us, including litigation, injunctions, damage awards, fines or penalties, or require us to change our business practices in a manner that could result in a material loss, require significant management time, result in the diversion of significant operational resources, or otherwise harm our business. 23 Table of Contents Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing We are subject to various anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws and regulations around the world that prohibit, among other things, our involvement in transferring the proceeds of criminal activities. Regulators in the U.S. and other regulators globally continue to increase their scrutiny of compliance with these obligations, which may require us to further revise or expand our compliance program, including the procedures we use to verify the identity of our customers and to monitor international and domestic transactions. Many countries in which we operate also have anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws and regulations, and we have been and will continue to be required to make changes to our compliance program in various jurisdictions in response. Such changes could have the effect of making compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage, lead to increased friction for customers, and result in a decrease in business. Regulators regularly re-examine the transaction volume thresholds at which we must obtain and keep applicable records or verify identities of customers and any change in such thresholds could result in greater costs for compliance. Non-compliance with anti-money laundering laws may subject us to significant fines, penalties, lawsuits, and enforcement actions, result in regulatory sanctions and additional compliance requirements, increase regulatory scrutiny of our business, restrict our operations or damage our reputation and brands. In the EU, for example, penalties for non-compliance with anti-money laundering laws could include fines of up to 10% of PayPal (Europe)’s total annual turnover. Privacy and Protection of User Data We are subject to a number of laws, rules, directives, and regulations (which we refer to as “privacy and data protection laws”) relating to the collection, use, retention, security, processing, and transfer (which we collectively refer to as “processing”) of personally identifiable information about our customers and employees (which we refer to as “personal data”) in the countries where we operate. Our business relies on the processing of personal data in many jurisdictions and the movement of data across national borders. As a result, much of the personal data that we process, which may include certain financial information associated with individuals, is regulated by multiple privacy and data protection laws and, in some cases, the privacy and data protection laws of multiple jurisdictions. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between or among us, our subsidiaries, and other parties with which we have commercial relationships.Regulatory scrutiny of privacy, data protection, cybersecurity practices, and the processing of personal data is increasing around the world. There is uncertainty associated with the legal and regulatory environment relating to privacy and data protection laws, which continue to develop in ways we cannot predict, including with respect to evolving technologies such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and blockchain technology. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or new laws of any government authority (including changes to or expansion of the interpretation of those laws), including those discussed in this risk factor, may subject us to significant fines, penalties, civil lawsuits, and enforcement actions in one or more jurisdictions, result in additional compliance requirements, increase regulatory scrutiny of our business, restrict our operations, and force us to change our business practices, make product or operational changes, or delay planned product launches or improvements.Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our privacy policies as communicated to users in one or more jurisdictions could result in proceedings or actions against us by data protection authorities, government entities or others, including class action privacy litigation in certain jurisdictions. Such proceedings or actions could subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments, and negative publicity which may materially harm our business. The foregoing may require us to change our business practices and would likely increase the costs and complexity of compliance. In addition, compliance with inconsistent privacy and data protection laws may restrict our ability to provide products and services to our customers.PayPal relies on a variety of compliance methods to transfer personal data of EEA individuals to the U.S., including reliance on Binding Corporate Rules (“BCRs”) for internal transfers of certain types of personal data and Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”) as approved by the European Commission for transfers to and from third parties. PayPal must also ensure that third parties processing personal data of PayPal’s EEA customers and/or employees outside of the EEA have compliant transfer mechanisms. In October 2015, the European Court of Justice invalidated U.S.-EU Safe Harbor framework clauses that were previously relied upon by some PayPal vendors to lawfully transfer personal data of EU citizens to U.S. companies, and PayPal entered into SCCs with those third parties which had previously relied on the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor framework. In July 2016, the U.S. and EU authorities agreed on a replacement for the Safe Harbor framework known as “Privacy Shield.” Both the Privacy Shield framework and SCCs continue to face legal challenges in the European justice system. To the extent that the Privacy Shield or SCCs are invalidated, PayPal’s ability to process EEA personal data with third parties outside of the EEA and intra-group with its U.S. affiliates could be jeopardized. 24 Table of Contents If one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their financial or performance obligations to us or fail, we may incur significant losses. We have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents, receivables outstanding, and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the U.S. and abroad. As part of our currency hedging activities, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments with various financial institutions. Certain banks and financial institutions are also lenders under our credit facilities. We regularly monitor our exposure to counterparty credit risk, and actively manage this exposure to mitigate the associated risk. Despite these efforts, we may be exposed to the risk of default by, or deteriorating operating results or financial condition or failure of, these counterparty financial institutions. The risk of counterparty default, deterioration, or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets. If one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or to access or recover our assets that are deposited, held in accounts with, or otherwise due from, such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty’s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties, we could incur significant losses, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. PayPal is not a bank or licensed lender in the U.S. and relies upon third parties to make loans and provide other products critical to our business, which raises additional risks. As PayPal is neither a chartered financial institution, nor licensed to make loans in any state in the U.S., we rely on third-party chartered financial institutions to provide PayPal branded credit products to our customers in the U.S., including consumer credit products such as PayPal Credit, PayPal branded credit cards, and merchant credit products such as PayPal Working Capital and PayPal Business Loan products. Any termination or interruption in a partner bank’s ability or willingness to lend could interrupt or limit our ability to offer consumer credit and merchant credit products, which could materially and adversely affect our business. In the event of a partner bank’s inability or unwillingness to lend, we may be unable to reach a similar agreement with another charter financial institution on favorable terms or at all. Obtaining a bank charter or lending licenses would be a costly, time-consuming and uncertain process, and would subject us to additional laws and regulatory requirements, which could significantly increase our costs and compliance obligations and require us to change our business practices, which could materially and adversely affect our business. In addition, as a service provider to these bank partners, which are federally supervised U.S. financial institutions, we are subject from time to time to examination by their federal banking regulators.In July 2018, we completed the sale of our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio to Synchrony Bank. As a part of a separate agreement, PayPal earns a revenue share on the portfolio of consumer receivables owned by Synchrony Bank, which includes both the sold and newly generated receivables, and we do not hold an ownership interest in newly generated consumer credit receivables. It may take us longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction, and those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. In addition, our increased reliance on, and credit exposure to, Synchrony Bank, including in connection with this agreement, subjects us to risks in the nature of those discussed in this “Risk Factors” section under the captions “We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk” and “If one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their financial or performance obligations to us or fail, we may incur significant losses.” Our ability to receive the benefit of our business finance offerings may be subject to challenge. Merchant loans and advances under our PayPal Working Capital and PayPal Business Loan products are provided by a state chartered industrial bank under a program agreement with us. We acquire the receivables generated by those loans after origination.A case decided in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, Madden v. Midland Funding, LLC (786 F.3d 246 (2d Cir. 2015)), resulted in uncertainty as to whether non-bank entities purchasing loans originated by a bank may rely on federal preemption of state usury laws, and may create an increased risk of litigation by plaintiffs challenging our ability to collect interest and fees in accordance with the terms of certain loans. The decision, which specifically addressed preemption under the National Bank Act, could support future challenges to federal preemption for other institutions, including FDIC-insured, state chartered industrial banks like the issuing bank of loans and advances under PayPal Working Capital and PayPal Business Loan products. There continue to be a number of U.S. state and federal court legal actions challenging the viability of business models where a non-bank entity enters into a relationship with a third-party chartered financial institution for the issuance of credit products. While we believe the manner in which PayPal branded credit products are offered can be distinguished from Madden, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of any potential litigation, and an adverse determination could materially impact our PayPal Working Capital and PayPal Business Loan products and our business. 25 Table of Contents Some of our credit products expose us to additional risks. We offer our PayPal Credit consumer product and our PayPal Working Capital and PayPal Business Loan products to a wide range of consumers and merchants in various markets, and the financial success of these products depends on the effective management of related risk. The credit decision-making process for the PayPal Credit consumer product uses proprietary segmentation and credit algorithms and other analytical techniques designed to analyze the credit risk of specific consumers based on, among other factors, their past purchasing and payment history with PayPal as well as their credit scores. Similarly, proprietary risk models and other indicators are applied to assess merchants who desire to use our business finance offerings to help predict their ability to repay. These risk models may not accurately predict the creditworthiness of a consumer or merchant due to factors such as inaccurate assumptions, including assumptions related to the particular consumer or merchant, market conditions, economic environment, or limited transaction history or other data, among other factors. The accuracy of these risk models and the ability to manage credit risk related to our credit products may also be affected by legal or regulatory requirements, competitors’ actions, changes in consumer behavior, changes in the economic environment, and other factors. Our international expansion of our credit product offerings expose us to additional risks, including those discussed in the risk factor captioned “Our international operations subject us to increased risks, which could harm our business.”Like other businesses with significant exposure to losses from merchant credit, we face the risk that account holders will default on their payment obligations, creating the risk of potential charge-offs. We face similar risks with respect to U.S. consumer credit losses through the profit-sharing arrangement with Synchrony Bank. The non-payment rate among account holders may increase due to, among other factors, changes to underwriting standards, risk models not accurately predicting the creditworthiness of a consumer, worsening economic conditions, such as a recession or government austerity programs, increases in prevailing interest rates, and high unemployment rates. Account holders who miss payments often fail to repay their loans, and account holders who file for protection under the bankruptcy laws generally do not repay their loans.We currently purchase receivables related to the PayPal branded merchant credit products in the U.S. If we are unable to fund our purchase of these receivables adequately or in a cost-effective manner, or if we are unable to efficiently manage the cash resources utilized for these purposes, our business could be harmed. Catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business War, terrorism, political events, geopolitical instability, trade barriers and restrictions, public health issues, natural disasters, or other catastrophic events have caused and could cause damage or disruption to the economy and commerce on a global, regional, or country-specific basis, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, our customers, and companies with which we do business. Such events could decrease demand for our products and services or make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products and services to our customers. Geopolitical trends, including nationalism, protectionism, and restrictive visa requirements could limit the expansion of our business in those regions. Our corporate headquarters are located in the Silicon Valley, which is a seismically active region in California. Our business operations are subject to interruption by, among others, natural disasters, fire, power shortages, earthquakes, floods, nuclear power plant accidents, and events beyond our control such as other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes and public health issues. A catastrophic event that results in a disruption or failure of our systems or operations could result in significant losses and require substantial recovery time and significant expenditures in order to resume or maintain operations, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Changes to our buyer and seller protection programs could increase our loss rate. Our buyer and seller protection programs protect merchants and consumers from fraudulent transactions, and protect consumers if they do not receive the item ordered or if the item received is significantly different from its description. In addition, consumers who pay through PayPal may have reimbursement rights from their payment card issuer (usually a bank), which in turn will seek recovery from us. The risk of losses from our buyer and seller protection programs are specific to individual buyers, sellers, and transactions, and may also be impacted by regional variations to these programs, modifications to these programs resulting from changes in regulatory requirements, or changes that we decide to implement, such as expanding the scope of transactions covered by one or more of these programs. Increases in our loss rate, including as a result of changes to our buyer and seller protection programs, could negatively impact our business. 26 Table of Contents Our international operations subject us to increased risks, which could harm our business. Our international operations have generated approximately one-half of our net revenues in recent years. There are risks inherent in doing business internationally on both a domestic (i.e., in-country) and cross-border basis, including, but not limited to:•foreign currency exchange and cross-border trade risks discussed earlier in this “Risk Factors” section under the captions “We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that could materially and adversely affect our financial results” and “Any factors that reduce cross-border trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business”;•risks related to government regulation or required compliance with local laws;•local licensing and reporting obligations;•local regulatory and legal obligations related to privacy, data protection, data localization, and user protections; •costs and challenges associated with localizing our products and services, including offering customers the ability to transact business in the local currency and adapting our products and services to local preferences (e.g., payment methods), in markets in which we may have limited or no experience;•trade barriers and changes in trade regulations;•difficulties in developing, staffing, and simultaneously managing a large number of varying foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences;•stringent local labor laws and regulations;•credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;•profit repatriation restrictions; •political or social unrest, economic instability, repression, or human rights issues;•geopolitical instability, natural disasters, public health issues, acts of war, and terrorism;•import or export regulations;•compliance with U.S. laws and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, and other local anticorruption laws;•compliance with U.S. and foreign laws designed to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities;•antitrust and competition regulations;•potentially adverse tax developments and consequences;•economic uncertainties relating to sovereign and other debt;•national or regional differences in macroeconomic growth rates; and•increased difficulties in collecting accounts receivable.Violations of the complex foreign and U.S. laws, rules and regulations that apply to our international operations may result in fines, criminal actions, or sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies. These risks are inherent in our international operations and expansion, may increase our costs of doing business internationally, and could harm our business. We are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates. We are exposed to interest rate risk from our investment portfolio and from interest-rate sensitive assets, including assets underlying the customer balances we hold on our balance sheet as customer accounts. A low or negative interest rate environment or reductions in interest rates may negatively impact our net income. In addition, fluctuations in interest rates may adversely impact our customers’ spending levels and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amounts owed to us. Higher interest rates often lead to higher payment obligations by customers to us and other lenders under mortgage, credit card, and other consumer and merchant loans, which may reduce our customers’ ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore lead to increased delinquencies, charge-offs, and allowances for loan and interest receivables, which could have an adverse effect on our net income.We have entered into a five-year revolving credit facility and a 364-day revolving credit facility as well as other committed and uncommitted credit facilities around the world. We have borrowed under our credit facilities from time to time, and any borrowings under these credit facilities that bear interest at a floating rate would expose us to interest rate fluctuations. 27 Table of Contents Use of our payments services for illegal purposes could harm our business. Our payment system is susceptible to potentially illegal or improper uses, including money laundering, terrorist financing, illegal online gambling, fraudulent sales of goods or services, illegal sales of prescription medications or controlled substances, piracy of software, movies, music, and other copyrighted or trademarked goods (in particular, digital goods), bank fraud, child pornography, human trafficking, prohibited sales of alcoholic beverages or tobacco products, securities fraud, pyramid or ponzi schemes, or the facilitation of other illegal activity. The use of our payment system for illegal or improper uses has subjected us, and may subject us in the future, to claims, individual and class action lawsuits, and government and regulatory investigations, inquiries, or requests that could result in liability and reputational harm for us. Moreover, certain activity that may be legal in one jurisdiction may be illegal in another jurisdiction, and a merchant may be found responsible for intentionally or inadvertently importing or exporting illegal goods, resulting in liability for us. Changes in law have increased the penalties for intermediaries providing payment services for certain illegal activities, and government authorities may consider additional payments-related proposals from time to time. Owners of intellectual property rights or government authorities may seek to bring legal action against providers of payments solutions, including PayPal, that are peripherally involved in the sale of infringing or allegedly infringing items. Any threatened or resulting claims could result in reputational harm, and any resulting liabilities, loss of transaction volume, or increased costs could harm our business. Our failure to manage our customer funds and the assets underlying our customer funds properly could harm our business. We hold a substantial amount of funds belonging to our customers, including balances in customer accounts and funds being remitted to sellers of goods and services or recipients of P2P transactions. In certain jurisdictions where we operate, we are required to hold eligible liquid assets (as defined by the relevant regulator in such jurisdiction) equal to at least 100% of the aggregate amount of all customer balances. Our ability to manage and accurately account for the assets underlying our customer funds and comply with applicable liquid asset requirements requires a high level of internal controls. As our business continues to grow and we expand our product offerings, we must continue to strengthen our associated internal controls. PayPal (Europe), with the permission of the CSSF, utilizes certain European customer balances held by our Luxembourg banking subsidiary to fund credit balances relating to certain customers. Our success requires significant public confidence in our ability to properly manage our customers’ balances and handle large and growing transaction volumes and amounts of customer funds. Any failure to maintain the necessary controls or to manage our customer funds and the assets underlying our customer funds accurately and in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements could result in reputational harm, lead customers to discontinue or reduce their use of our products, and result in significant penalties and fines and additional restrictions, which could materially harm our business. We are subject to regulatory activity and legal proceedings under antitrust and competition laws. We are subject to scrutiny by various government agencies regarding antitrust and competition laws and regulations in the U.S. and internationally, including in connection with proposed business combinations, acquisitions, and investments. Some jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to assert claims of anticompetitive conduct. Other companies and government agencies have in the past and may in the future allege that our actions violate the antitrust or competition laws of the U.S., individual states, other countries, or the EU, or otherwise constitute unfair competition. Some regulators and legislators, particularly those outside of the U.S., may perceive that our products and services are used so broadly that otherwise uncontroversial business practices could be deemed anticompetitive. Any claims or investigations, even if without merit, may be very expensive to defend or respond to, involve negative publicity, and substantial diversion of management time and effort, and could result in reputational harm, significant judgments, fines or remedial actions against us, or require us to change our business practices, make product or operational changes, or delay or preclude planned transactions, product launches or improvements. We are subject to patent litigation. We have been sued repeatedly for allegedly infringing other parties’ patents. At any given time, we are typically a defendant in a number of patent lawsuits. We expect that we will continue to be subject to patent infringement claims because, among other reasons:•our products and services continue to expand in scope and complexity and to converge with technologies not previously associated with the payments space;•we continue to expand into new business areas, including through acquisitions; and•the number of patent owners who may claim that we, any of the companies that we have acquired, or our customers infringe their patents, and the aggregate number of patents controlled by such patent owners, continues to increase.Such claims may be brought directly against us or against our users, whom we may indemnify due to contractual obligations or as a business matter. We believe that many of the claims against us and other technology companies have been, and continue to be, initiated by third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims. We vigorously defend against patent infringement claims. In addition, we have seen significant patent disputes between operating companies in some technology industries. Patent claims, whether meritorious or not, could be time-consuming, divert management’s resources, be costly to manage, defend, and resolve and lead to attempts by other parties to pursue similar claims. Additionally, patent claims could require us to make expensive changes in our methods of doing business, enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements, make substantial payments to satisfy adverse judgments or settle claims or proceedings, or cease conducting certain operations, which would harm our business. 28 Table of Contents We may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or third parties may allege that we are infringing their intellectual property rights. The protection of our intellectual property, including our trademarks, patents, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, and trade secrets, is important to the success of our business. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on applicable laws and regulations in the U.S. and internationally, as well as a variety of administrative procedures. We also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights when offering or procuring products and services, including confidentiality and invention assignment agreements entered into with our employees and contractors and confidentiality agreements with parties with whom we conduct business.Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we offer our products and services. We may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our rights.Although we have generally taken measures to protect our intellectual property rights, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in protecting or enforcing our rights in every jurisdiction, or that contractual arrangements and other steps that we have taken to protect our intellectual property will prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our intellectual property or deter independent development of equivalent or superior intellectual property rights by others. If we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting, registering, or using trademarks and trade dress that infringe, dilute, or otherwise violate our trademark rights, the value of our brands could be diminished and our business could be adversely affected. We may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. We have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to others. These licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation. Any failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or significant costs incurred in doing so, could diminish the value of our intangible assets and materially harm our business.As the number of products in the technology and payments industries increases and the functionality of these products further overlaps, and as we acquire technology through acquisitions or licenses, we may become increasingly subject to intellectual property infringement and other claims. Litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of the patent and other intellectual property rights of others. The ultimate outcome of any allegation is often uncertain and, regardless of the outcome, any such claim, with or without merit, may be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert management’s time and attention from our business, and require us to, among other things, redesign or stop providing our products or services, pay substantial amounts to satisfy judgments or settle claims or lawsuits, pay substantial royalty or licensing fees, or satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with certain parties with whom we have commercial relationships. Our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights, or litigation or claims arising out of intellectual property matters, may harm or restrict our business. We are regularly subject to general litigation, regulatory actions, and government inquiries. We are regularly subject to claims, individual and class action lawsuits, government and regulatory investigations, inquiries, actions or requests, and other proceedings alleging violations of laws, rules, and regulations with respect to competition, antitrust, intellectual property, privacy, data protection, information security, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, sanctions, anti-corruption, consumer protection, fraud, accessibility, securities, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, services, charitable fundraising, contract disputes, escheatment of unclaimed or abandoned property, the matters described in Note 13—“Commitments and Contingencies—Litigation and Regulatory Matters—General Matters” to our consolidated financial statements, and other matters. In particular, our business faces ongoing consumer protection and intellectual property litigation, as discussed above. The number and significance of these disputes and inquiries may increase as our business expands in scale, scope and geographic reach, and our products and services increase in scale and complexity. In addition, the laws, rules and regulations affecting our business, including those pertaining to internet and mobile commerce, data protection, payments services, and credit, are subject to ongoing interpretation by the courts and government authorities, and the resulting uncertainty in their scope and application increases the risk that we will be subject to private claims and government actions alleging violations.The scope, outcome, and impact of claims, lawsuits, government investigations, disputes, and proceedings to which we are subject cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of the outcome, such matters can have an adverse impact, which may be material, on our business, results of operations, or financial condition because of legal costs, diversion of management resources, reputational damage, and other factors. Determining reserves for our pending litigation and regulatory proceedings is a complex, fact-intensive process that involves a high degree of judgment. Resolving one or more of such legal and regulatory proceedings or other matters could potentially require us to make substantial payments to satisfy judgments, fines, or penalties or to settle claims or proceedings, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. These proceedings could also result in reputational harm, criminal sanctions, consent decrees, or orders that prevent us from offering certain products or services, require us to change our business practices in costly ways, or develop non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies. Any of these consequences could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.While certain of our customer agreements contain arbitration provisions with class action waiver provisions that may limit our exposure to consumer class action litigation, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in enforcing these arbitration provisions, including the class action waiver provisions, in the future or in any given case. Legislative, administrative, or regulatory developments may directly or indirectly prohibit or limit the use of pre-dispute arbitration clauses and class action waiver provisions. Any such prohibitions or limitations on or discontinuation of the use of, such arbitration or class action waiver provisions could subject us to additional lawsuits, including additional consumer class action litigation, and significantly limit our ability to avoid exposure from consumer class action litigation. 29 Table of Contents Changes in U.S. tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations, and financial conditions. In December 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive Federal tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act made changes to the corporate tax rate, business-related deductions, and taxation of foreign earnings, among others, that are generally effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. Throughout 2018 and 2019, the U.S. Treasury and certain states issued proposed and final legislation and clarifying guidance with respect to the various provisions of the Tax Act. Additional legislation and guidance is expected to be issued in 2020 and could have a material adverse impact on the value of our U.S. deferred tax assets, result in significant changes to currently computed income tax liabilities for past and current tax periods, and increase our future U.S. tax expense. The implementation by us of new practices and processes designed to comply with, and benefit from, the Tax Act and its rules and regulations could require us to make substantial changes to our business practices, allocate additional resources, and increase our costs, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities. The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation and significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Like many other multinational corporations, we are subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Our determination of our tax liability is always subject to audit and review by applicable domestic and foreign authorities, and we are currently undergoing a number of investigations, audits, and reviews by authorities throughout the world. Any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could have a negative effect on our business, and the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the periods for which such determination is made. While we have established reserves based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventualities, these reserves may prove to be insufficient.In addition, our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated, or by the incurrence of losses, in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, as a result of gains on our foreign currency exchange risk management program; or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items.Various levels of government, such as U.S. federal and state legislatures, and international organizations, such as the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) and the EU, are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative or regulatory action to increase tax revenue. Various countries, most notably in the EU, have proposed or enacted digital services taxes. Any such tax reform or other legislative or regulatory actions could increase our effective tax rate. 30 Table of Contents We and our merchants may be subject to sales reporting and record-keeping obligations. A number of U.S. states, the U.S. federal government, and foreign countries have implemented or are in the process of implementing reporting or record-keeping obligations on companies that engage in or facilitate e-commerce to improve tax compliance. Additionally, a number of jurisdictions are reviewing whether payment service providers and other intermediaries could be deemed to be the legal agent of merchants for certain tax purposes. We have modified our systems to meet applicable requirements and expect that further modifications will be required to comply with future requirements, which may negatively impact our customer experience and increase operational costs. Any failure by us to comply with these and similar reporting and record-keeping obligations could result in substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions, adversely impact our ability to do business in certain jurisdictions, and harm our business. Acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic investments, and other strategic transactions could result in operating difficulties and could harm our business. Acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic investments, and other strategic transactions are important elements of our overall corporate strategy. We expect to continue to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions as part of our overall business strategy, including business combinations, acquisitions, and dispositions of certain businesses, technologies, services, products, and other assets, as well as joint ventures, strategic investments, and commercial and strategic partnerships. These transactions may involve significant challenges, uncertainties, and risks, including:•the potential loss of key customers, vendors, and other key business partners of the companies we acquire, or dispose of, following and continuing after announcement of our transaction plans;•difficulty making strategic hires of new employees, declining employee morale, and retention issues affecting employees (particularly the potential loss of key personnel) of companies that we acquire or dispose of, which may result from changes in compensation, management, reporting relationships, future prospects, or the direction of the acquired or disposed business;•differences between our culture and values and those of our acquired companies;•diversion of management time and focus;•the need to and difficulty of integrating the operations, systems (including accounting, compliance, management, information, human resource, and other administrative systems), technologies, data assets, products, and personnel of each acquired company, which is an inherently risky and potentially lengthy and costly process;•the need to and difficulty of implementing and/or enhancing controls, procedures, and policies appropriate for a larger public company at acquired companies which, prior to the acquisition, may have lacked such controls, procedures, and policies or whose controls, procedures, and policies did not meet applicable legal and regulatory standards;•the inefficiencies and lack of control that may result if integration of acquired companies is delayed or not implemented, and unforeseen difficulties and costs that may arise as a result;•potential exposure to new or increased regulatory oversight and uncertain or evolving legal, regulatory, and compliance requirements associated with new products and services or entry into new markets, including transactions with, or investments in, companies involved in new or developing businesses or industries;•potential reputational risks that could arise from transactions with, or investments in, companies involved in new or developing businesses or industries, which may be subject to uncertain or evolving legal, regulatory, and compliance requirements;•risks associated with our expansion into new international markets, and challenges caused by integrating operations across geographies, and different languages, cultures and political environments;•unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence process, including, but not limited to, product or service quality issues, intellectual property issues, and legal contingencies;•risks associated with the complexity of entering into and effectively managing joint ventures, strategic investments, and other strategic partnerships;•risks associated with undetected cyberattacks or security breaches at companies that we acquire or with which we may combine or partner;•lawsuits or regulatory actions resulting from the transaction;•liability for activities or conduct of an acquired company before the acquisition, including legal and regulatory claims or disputes, violations of laws and regulations, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities;•the need to maintain, and comply with the requirements of licenses for certain companies that we have acquired, and risks associated with any failure to maintain such licenses or comply with associated requirements;•the acquisition of new customer and employee personal data, which in and of itself may require regulatory approval and/or additional controls, policies, and procedures, and subject us to additional exposure and additional complexity and costs of compliance; •potential financial and credit risks associated with acquired customers, vendors, and partners; and•our dependence on the accounting, financial reporting, operating metrics and similar systems, controls and processes of acquired businesses, and the risk that errors or irregularities in those systems, controls, and processes will lead to errors in our financial statements or make it more difficult to manage the acquired business.At any given time, we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more strategic transactions, any of which could, individually or in the aggregate, be material to our financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying, negotiating, and consummating favorable transaction opportunities. It may take us longer than expected to fully realize the anticipated benefits and synergies of these transactions, and those benefits and synergies may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Because acquisitions are inherently risky, our transactions may not be successful and may, in some cases, harm our operating results or financial condition. Any acquisitions, dispositions, or investments may also require us to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt (and increased interest expense), recognize liabilities, and record gains or losses (realized or unrealized) and amortization expenses related to intangible assets or write-offs of goodwill or intangibles, which could dilute the economic and voting rights of our stockholders and adversely affect our results of operations and the interests of holders of our indebtedness, as applicable.Joint ventures and strategic investments in which we have a minority ownership stake inherently involve a lesser degree of influence over business operations, thereby potentially increasing the financial, legal, operational, and/or compliance risks associated with the joint venture or strategic investment. In addition, we may be dependent on joint venture partners, controlling shareholders, management, or other persons or entities who control them and who may have business interests, strategies, or goals that are inconsistent with ours. Business decisions or other actions or omissions of the joint venture partners, controlling shareholders, management, or other persons or entities who control joint ventures or companies in which we invest may adversely affect the value of our investment, result in litigation or regulatory action against us, and otherwise damage our reputation and brand. 31 Table of Contents There are risks associated with our indebtedness. We have incurred indebtedness, and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness we incur may have significant consequences, including, without limitation, the following:•our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations and generate sufficient cash flows to service such debt. We may be required to use a significant portion of our cash flow from operations and other available cash to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of cash available for other purposes, including capital expenditures, acquisitions, and strategic investments;•our indebtedness and leverage may increase our vulnerability to downturns in our business, to competitive pressures, and to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions;•our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, or other general corporate and other purposes may be limited; and•our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry may be limited.Our revolving credit facilities and the indenture for our senior unsecured notes pursuant to which certain of our outstanding debt securities were issued contain financial and other covenants that restrict or could restrict, among other things, our business and operations. If we fail to pay amounts due under a debt instrument or breach any of its covenants, the lenders would typically have the right to demand immediate repayment of all borrowings thereunder (subject in certain cases to a grace or cure period). Moreover, any such acceleration and required repayment of, or default in respect of, our indebtedness could, in turn, constitute an event of default under other debt instruments, thereby resulting in the acceleration and required repayment of our indebtedness. Any of these events could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.In addition, changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity securities and increase our borrowing costs. If our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, the interest rates payable by us under our indebtedness may increase. In addition, any downgrades to our credit ratings may affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and the terms of any such financing. Any of these factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk. We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, including the following:•networks, banks, payment processors, and payment gateways that link us to the payment card and bank clearing networks to process transactions;•unaffiliated third-party lenders to originate the U.S. PayPal Credit, PayPal-branded credit card, PayPal Working Capital, and PayPal Business Loan products;•third parties that provide loan servicing and customer statements processing;•third parties that provide certain outsourced customer support and product development functions, which are critical to our operations; and•third parties that provide facilities, infrastructure, components, and services, including data center facilities and cloud computing.Because we rely on third parties to provide certain of our services and to facilitate certain of our business activities, we face increased operational risk. These third parties may be subject to financial, legal, regulatory, and labor issues, cybersecurity incidents, privacy breaches, service terminations, disruptions or interruptions, or other problems, which may impose additional costs or requirements on us or prevent these third parties from providing services to us or our customers on our behalf, which could harm our business. In addition, these third parties may breach their agreements with us, disagree with our interpretation of contract terms or applicable laws and regulations, refuse to continue or renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms or at all, fail or refuse to process transactions or provide other services adequately, take actions that degrade the functionality of our services, impose additional costs or requirements on us or our customers, or give preferential treatment to competitive services. There can be no assurance that third parties who provide services directly to us or our customers on our behalf will continue to do so on acceptable terms, or at all. If any third parties do not adequately or appropriately provide their services or perform their responsibilities to us or our customers on our behalf, we may be unable to procure alternatives from other third parties in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all, and we may be subject to business disruptions, losses or costs to remediate any of the deficiencies, customer dissatisfaction, reputational damage, legal or regulatory proceedings, or other adverse consequences which could harm our business. 32 Table of Contents Our point of sale solutions expose us to additional risks. We have several point of sale solutions, which enable merchants to accept payments using a payments card reader attached to, or otherwise communicating with, a mobile device or to scan payment cards and codes using the mobile device’s embedded camera, and which enable consumers to use their mobile devices to pay at the point of sale. We have entered into strategic partnerships with major payment card networks to further expand our relationship in a way that will make it easier for merchants to accept and consumers to choose to pay for transactions utilizing credit and debit cards via PayPal at the point of sale. Those agreements provide us with access to each of these partner's tokenization services in the U.S. for in-store point-of-sale PayPal transactions, which we expect will increase the number of point of sale transactions that we process. We believe that the addition of the iZettle point of sale solutions to our product portfolio will enable us to further expand our in-store presence. As we continue to expand our product and service offerings at the point of sale, we will face additional risks, including:•increased expectations from merchants regarding the reliability and availability of our systems and services and correspondingly lower amounts of downtime, which we may not be able to meet;•increased expectations from merchants that our systems and services will help them to comply with laws and regulations relating to tax, accounting, and bookkeeping, such as cash register systems, which we may not be able to meet;•significant competition at the point of sale, particularly from established payment card providers, many of which have substantially greater resources than we do, and from other competing sale channels (such as e-commerce);•increased targeting by fraudsters; given that our fraud models are less developed in this area, we may experience increases in fraud and associated transaction losses as we adjust to potential fraudulent activity at the point of sale;•exposure to product liability claims to the extent that hardware devices (e.g., card readers) that we produce for use at the point of sale malfunction or are not in compliance with laws, which could result in substantial liability and require product recalls or other actions;•constraints in key resources to develop and maintain point of sale software and ancillary hardware;•exposure to additional laws, rules, and regulations;•increased reliance on third parties involved with processing in-store payments, including independent software providers, electronic point of sale providers, hardware providers (such as card reader, cash drawer, and pin-pad providers), payment processors, and banks that enable in-store transactions; and•lower operating income than our other payment solutions.Unless we are able to successfully manage these risks, including driving adoption of, and significant volume through, our point of sale solutions over time, our business may be harmed. 33 Table of Contents Our success largely depends on key personnel. Because competition for our key employees is intense, we may not be able to attract, retain, and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our business. The loss of key personnel could harm our ability to maintain and grow our business. Our future success and performance are significantly dependent upon the continued services of key personnel, including our executive team and other highly skilled employees, and our ability to attract, retain, and motivate such personnel. Competition for key personnel is intense, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area, where our corporate headquarters are located and where the cost of living is high, and we may be unable to successfully attract, integrate, or retain sufficiently qualified key personnel. In making employment decisions, particularly in the technology and payments industries, job candidates often consider the value of the equity awards they would receive in connection with their employment, and our stock price volatility, or a perception that the market price of our stock may not increase or may increase more slowly than stock prices at other technology or payments companies, may make it more difficult to attract, retain, and motivate employees. We may be limited in our ability to recruit or hire internationally, including due to restrictive laws or policies on immigration, travel, or availability of visas for skilled workers. In addition, we do not have long-term employment agreements with any of our key personnel and do not maintain any “key person” life insurance policies. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel, or our inability to attract or retain highly qualified key personnel effectively, could harm our business and growth prospects. We are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our products and services. Companies providing online services may be subject to claims relating to information disseminated through them, including claims alleging defamation, libel, harassment, hate speech, breach of contract, invasion of privacy, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through the services, among other things. The laws relating to the liability of companies providing online services for information disseminated through their services are subject to frequent challenges. We are also subject to potential liability to third parties for the customer-provided content on our products and services, particularly in jurisdictions outside the U.S. where the applicable laws are unsettled. If we become liable for information provided by our customers and carried on our products and services, we could be directly harmed and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability, including expending substantial resources or discontinuing certain product or service offerings, which could harm our business. Risks Related to Our Separation from eBay If the distribution, together with certain related transactions, does not qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), eBay, PayPal and eBay stockholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities. On July 17, 2015, we became an independent publicly traded company through the pro rata distribution by eBay Inc. of 100% of our outstanding common stock to eBay’s stockholders (which we sometimes refer to as the “separation” or the “distribution”). eBay received an opinion from its outside legal counsel regarding the qualification of the distribution, together with certain related transactions, as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code. The opinion was based on and relied on, among other things, certain facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements, and undertakings of eBay and of us, including those relating to the past and future conduct of eBay and of us. If any of these representations, statements, or undertakings were, or became, inaccurate or incomplete, or if eBay or we breach any of our respective covenants in the separation documents, the opinion of counsel may be invalid, and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized.Notwithstanding the opinion of counsel, the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) could determine that the distribution, together with certain related transactions, should be treated as a taxable transaction if the IRS determines that any of these representations, assumptions, or undertakings upon which such opinion was based are incorrect or have been violated or if the IRS disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel. An opinion of counsel is not binding on the IRS or any court and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge the conclusions reached in the opinion. The IRS did not provide any opinion in advance of the separation that our proposed transaction is tax-free.If the distribution, together with certain related transactions, failed to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code, in general, eBay would recognize taxable gain as if it had sold the PayPal common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value, eBay stockholders who received PayPal common stock in the distribution may be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares, and we could incur significant liabilities. 34 Table of Contents There are risks associated with our relationship with eBay. In connection with our separation from eBay, we entered into a separation and distribution agreement with eBay, as well as various other agreements, including an operating agreement, a tax matters agreement, an employee matters agreement, an intellectual property matters agreement, a data sharing addendum, and a product development agreement. The separation agreement, the tax matters agreement, the employee matters agreement, and the intellectual property matters agreement determined the allocation of assets and liabilities (including by means of licensing) between the companies following the separation for those respective areas and include associated indemnification obligations. The operating agreement, the data sharing addendum, and the product development agreement establish certain commercial relationships between eBay and us related to payment processing, credit, and data sharing. If either we or eBay are unable to satisfy our performance, payment, or indemnification obligations under these agreements, we could incur operational difficulties or losses or be required to make substantial indemnification or other payments to eBay.Disputes between eBay and us have arisen and others may arise in the future. An adverse outcome in any such matters could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. eBay and PayPal are currently involved in a dispute regarding the calculation and amount of referral services fees due to eBay under the operating agreement. The parties are currently in arbitration proceedings with respect to this dispute pursuant to the dispute resolution provisions in the separation and distribution agreement.Our relationship with eBay is governed, in part, by an operating agreement entered into at separation with a term of five years expiring July 2020 and a one-year tail period. This operating agreement defines a number of important elements of our commercial relationship with eBay, as well as certain obligations and restrictions that limit PayPal’s provision of services to certain competitive platform operators of eBay (as specified in the operating agreement). While eBay remains a significant source of our revenues and operating income, we expect the portion of our revenue and operating income attributable to eBay to continue to decline due to various factors (many of which are beyond our control), including the expiration (or earlier termination) of the operating agreement with eBay, and the speed and extent to which eBay intermediates payments on its platform (including by acting as a merchant of record and migrating eBay merchants to eBay's managed payments platform), limits the availability of PayPal as a payment option or offers (or promotes) alternative payment options, directs transactions on its platforms to different providers of payment services, or eliminates or modifies its risk management or customer protection programs on its platforms, which could result in customer dissatisfaction, reduction in eBay volume, and other consequences adverse to our business. If we are unable to generate sufficient business from our non-eBay customers to offset the expected reduction in the portion of our business attributable to eBay, it could materially impact the growth in our business and our ability to meet our long-term financial targets. Risks Related to Our Common Stock The price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly. The price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including, but not limited to:•actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;•changes in financial estimates by us or securities analysts and recommendations or lack of coverage and reports by securities analysts;•changes in our capital structure;•the activities of our competitors; •speculation, coverage, or sentiment in the media or the investment community;•the operating and stock price performance and valuation of comparable companies;•our quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in our industry;•the public's reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements, and our filings with the SEC;•additions or departures of key personnel; •announcements related to litigation, regulation, or disputes;•changes to the regulatory and legal environment under which we operate; and•market conditions or trends in the payments industry, the industries of merchants, and the domestic and worldwide economy as a whole.As a result of these and other factors, investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above the price at which they purchase our common stock. In addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies like us. These broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In addition, in the past, some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have been subject to class action or derivative lawsuits. The filing of a lawsuit against us, regardless of the outcome, could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, as it could result in substantial legal costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources. 35 Table of Contents Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the state courts of the State of Delaware, or, if no state court located in the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the District of Delaware, as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could discourage lawsuits against us and our directors and officers. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that unless the corporation otherwise determines, the state courts of the State of Delaware, or, if no state court located in the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the District of Delaware, will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors or officers to us or our stockholders, any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“DGCL”) or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes with us or our directors or officers, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors and officers. Alternatively, if a court outside of Delaware were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above, we could incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may prevent or delay an acquisition of our company, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock. Certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of deterring coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and by encouraging prospective acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others:•rules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings;•the fact that directors may not be elected, removed, or replaced at stockholder-requested special meetings unless a person, entity, or group owns at least a majority of our outstanding common stock;•the right of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock and to determine the voting, dividend, and other rights of preferred stock without stockholder approval;•the ability of our directors, and not stockholders, to fill vacancies on our board of directors in most circumstances and to determine the size of our board of directors;•the prohibition on stockholders acting by written consent; and•the absence of cumulative rights in the election of directors.We have also elected not to be governed by Section 203 of the DGCL, which provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that acquire, or are affiliated with a person that acquires, more than 15% of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation, or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the date on which that person or its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15% of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, however, contains a provision that generally mirrors Section 203 of the DGCL, except that it provides for a 20% threshold instead of the 15% provided for by the DGCL. These provisions could delay or prevent a change of control that our stockholders may favor.While these provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers, they will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and may delay or prevent an acquisition that our Board of Directors determines is not in the best interests of us and our stockholders. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. The following discussion is divided into three sections. The first section, which begins immediately following this paragraph, discusses some of the risks that may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. The second section, captioned “Risks Related to Our Separation from eBay” discusses some of the risks relating to our separation from eBay in July 2015 into an independent publicly traded company. The third section, captioned “Risks Related to Our Common Stock,” discusses some of the risks relating to an investment in our Common Stock. You should carefully review all of these sections in addition to the other information appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, for important information regarding risks and uncertainties that affect us. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business, Results of Operations, and Financial Condition We face substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry. The global payments industry is highly competitive, rapidly changing, highly innovative, and increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny and oversight. We compete against a wide range of businesses, including those that are larger than we are, have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, or a dominant or more secure position, or offer other products and services to consumers and merchants that we do not offer, as well as smaller or younger companies that may be more agile in responding quickly to regulatory and technological changes. Many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Competition also may intensify as businesses enter into business combinations and partnerships, and established companies in other segments expand to become competitive with different aspects of our business.We compete primarily on the basis of the following:•ability to attract, retain, and engage both merchants and consumers on our Payments Platform;•ability to demonstrate to merchants that they may achieve incremental sales by using and offering our services to consumers;•consumer confidence in the safety and security of transactions on our Payments Platform, including the ability for consumers to use our products and services without sharing their financial information with the merchant or any other party they are paying;•simplicity and transparency of our fee structure;•ability to develop products and services across multiple commerce channels, including e-commerce, mobile, and payments at the point of sale;•trust in our dispute resolution and buyer and seller protection programs;•customer service experience;•brand recognition and preference;•website, mobile platform, and application onboarding, ease-of-use, speed, availability, and dependability;•ability of our Payments Platform to support across technologies and payment methods;•system reliability and data security;•ability to assist merchants in complying with payments-related laws and regulations;•ease and quality of integration into third-party mobile applications and operating systems; and•quality of developer tools, such as our application programming interfaces and software development kits.We compete against a wide range of businesses with varying roles in all forms of payments, including:•paper-based transactions (principally cash and checks);•banks and financial institutions providing traditional payment methods, particularly credit and debit cards (collectively, “payment cards”) and electronic bank transfers;•payment networks which facilitate payments for credit card users;•providers of “digital wallets” which offer customers the ability to pay online and/or in-store through a variety of payment methods, including with mobile applications, through contactless payments, and with a variety of payment cards;•providers of mobile payments solutions that use tokenized card data approaches and contactless payments (e.g., near field communication (“NFC”) or host card emulation functionality) to eliminate the need to swipe or insert a card or enter a personal identification number or password;•payment-card processors that offer their services to merchants, including for “card on file” payments where the merchant invites the consumer to select a payment method for their first transaction and to use the same payment method for subsequent transactions;•providers of person-to-person (“P2P”) payments that facilitate individuals sending money with an email address or mobile phone number;•merchants and merchant associations that may provide proprietary payment networks to facilitate payments within their own retail network;•providers of money remittance services for transferring money abroad, including those that may provide proprietary payment networks;•providers of card readers for mobile devices and of other point-of-sale and multi-channel technologies; and•providers of virtual currencies and distributed ledger technologies.We often partner with many of these businesses and we consider the ability to continue establishing these partnerships as important to our business. Competition for relationships with these partners is intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to establish, grow, or maintain these partner relationships.We also face competition and potential competition from:•services that provide online merchants the option of paying for purchases from their bank account or paying on credit;•issuers of stored value products targeted at online payments;•other online and mobile payment-services providers globally;•services targeting users of social networks and online gaming, including those offering social commerce and P2P payments;•payment services enabling banking customers to send and receive payments through their bank account, including through immediate or real-time payments systems;•e-commerce services that provide special offers linked to a specific payment provider; •services that help merchants and consumers use, accept, buy, sell, and manage virtual currencies; and•electronic funds transfer services as a method of payment for both online and offline transactions.Some of our current and potential competitors have larger customer bases, broader geographic scope, volume, scale, resources, and market share than we do, which may provide them significant competitive advantages. Some competitors may also be subject to less burdensome licensing, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, and other regulatory requirements. They may devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of products and services, and offer lower prices or more effectively offer their own innovative programs, products, and services.If we are not able to differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors, drive value for our customers, or effectively and efficiently align our resources with our goals and objectives, we may not be able to compete effectively in the market. 12 Table of Contents 13 Table of Contents Substantially all of our net revenues each quarter come primarily from transactions involving payments during that quarter, which may result in significant fluctuations in our operating results that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, as well as the trading price of our common stock. Substantially all of our net revenues each quarter come primarily from transactions involving payments during that quarter. As a result, our operating and financial results have varied on a quarterly basis during our operating history and may continue to fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including the risks set forth in this “Risk Factors” section. It is difficult for us to forecast accurately the level or source of our revenues or earnings. In view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful, and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance. Due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting revenues, it is also difficult to forecast expenses. Quarterly and annual expenses reflected in our financial statements may be significantly different from historical or projected rates. Our operating results in one or more future quarters may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. The trading price of our common stock may decline significantly as a result of the factors described in this paragraph. Global and regional economic conditions could harm our business. Our operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions. Uncertainty about global and regional economic events and conditions may result in consumers and businesses postponing or lowering spending in response to, among other factors:•tighter credit, •higher unemployment, •consumer debt levels or reduced consumer confidence,•financial market volatility, •fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, •changes and uncertainties related to government fiscal and tax policies,•changes and uncertainties about U.S and international trade relationships, agreements, policies, treaties and restrictive actions, as well as the possibility of significant increases in tariffs on imported goods, and other restrictive actions,•the inability of the U.S. Congress to enact a budget in a fiscal year, a sequestration, and/or another shutdown of the U.S. government,•government austerity programs, and •other negative financial news or macroeconomic developments.These and other global and regional economic events and conditions, including Brexit, could have a material adverse impact on the demand for our products and services, including a reduction in the volume and size of transactions on our Payments Platform. In addition, any financial turmoil affecting the banking system or financial markets could cause additional consolidation of the financial services industry, significant failures of financial service institutions, new or incremental tightening in the credit markets, low liquidity, and extreme volatility or distress in the fixed income, credit, currency, and equity markets, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. See also the risk factor captioned, “The United Kingdom's departure from the EU could adversely affect us.” If we cannot keep pace with rapid technological developments to provide new and innovative products and services, the use of our products and services and, consequently, our revenues could decline. Rapid, significant, and disruptive technological changes impact the industries in which we operate, including developments in: •technologies supporting our regulatory and compliance obligations (e.g., in relation to our know your customer (“KYC”) and customer identification program (“CIP”) obligations under anti-money laundering regulations); •artificial intelligence and machine learning (e.g., in relation to fraud and risk decisioning);•payment technologies (e.g., real time payments, payment card tokenization, virtual currencies, including distributed ledger and blockchain technologies, and proximity payment technology, such as NFC and other contactless payments); •technologies (e.g., internet browser technology, that enable users to easily store their payment card information for use on any retail or e-commerce website; and•commerce technologies, including in-store, online, mobile, virtual, and social commerce (i.e., ecommerce through social networks).As a result, we expect new services and technologies to continue to emerge and evolve, and we cannot predict the effects of technological changes on our business. In addition to our own initiatives and innovations, we rely in part on third parties, including some of our competitors, for the development of and access to new or evolving technologies. These third parties may restrict or prevent our access to, or utilization of, those technologies, as well as their platforms or products. In addition, we may not be able to accurately predict which technological developments or innovations will become widely adopted and how those technologies may be regulated. We expect that new services and technologies applicable to the industries in which we operate will continue to emerge and may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies we currently use in our products and services. Developing and incorporating new technologies into our products and services may require substantial expenditures, take considerable time, and ultimately may not be successful. In addition, our ability to adopt new products and services and to develop new technologies may be inhibited by industry-wide standards, platform providers, payments networks, changes to laws and regulations, the extent of changing expectations of consumers or merchants, third-party intellectual property rights, or other factors. Our success will depend on our ability to develop and incorporate new technologies and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards; if we are unable to do so in a timely or cost-effective manner, our business could be harmed. 14 Table of Contents Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to our reputation, business, and financial condition. Our business involves the collection, storage, processing, and transmission of confidential information and customers’ personal data, including financial information and information about how they interact with our Payments Platform. We have built our reputation on the premise that our Payments Platform offers customers a more secure way to make payments. An increasing number of organizations, including large merchants, businesses, technology companies, and financial institutions, as well as government institutions, have disclosed breaches of their information security systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks, including on their websites, mobile applications, and infrastructure.The techniques used to obtain unauthorized, improper, or illegal access to systems and information (including customers’ personal data), disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and have become increasingly complex and sophisticated, may be difficult to detect quickly, and often are not recognized or detected until after they have been launched against a target. Unauthorized parties have attempted, and we expect that they will continue to attempt, to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means, including, but not limited to, hacking into our systems or facilities or those of our customers, partners, or vendors, and attempting to fraudulently induce users of our systems (including employees and our customers) into disclosing user names, passwords, payment card information, or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems. Threats can come from a variety of sources, including criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage, and insider threats. Certain efforts may be supported by significant financial and technological resources, making them even more sophisticated and difficult to detect. Numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats, including advanced and persisting cyberattacks, cyberextortion, spear phishing and social engineering schemes, the introduction of computer viruses or other malware, and the physical destruction of all or portions of our information technology and infrastructure could compromise the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the data in our systems. We believe that PayPal is a particularly attractive target for such breaches and attacks due to our name and brand recognition and the widespread adoption and use of our products and services. Although we have developed systems and processes designed to protect data we manage, prevent data loss and other security breaches and effectively respond to known and potential risks, and expect to continue to expend significant resources to bolster these protections, there can be no assurance that these security measures will provide absolute security or prevent breaches or attacks. Our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyberattacks or security breaches, and third parties may be able to access our customers’ personal or proprietary information and payment card data that are stored on or accessible through those systems. We have experienced from time to time, and may experience in the future, breaches of our security measures due to human error, malfeasance, insider threats, system errors or vulnerabilities, or other irregularities. Actual or perceived breaches of our security could, among other things:•interrupt our operations, •result in our systems or services being unavailable, •result in improper disclosure of data and violations of applicable privacy and other laws,•materially harm our reputation and brands, •result in significant regulatory scrutiny, investigations, fines, penalties and other legal and financial exposure, •cause us to incur significant remediation costs, •lead to loss of customer confidence in, or decreased use of, our products and services, •divert the attention of management from the operation of our business, •result in significant compensation or contractual penalties from us to our customers and their business partners as a result of losses to them or claims by them, and •adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, any cyberattacks or data security breaches affecting the information technology or infrastructure of companies we acquire or of our customers, partners, or vendors (including data center and cloud computing providers) could have similar negative effects. See Note 4—“Business Combinations,” Note 5—“Goodwill and Intangible Assets” and Note 13—“Commitments and Contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements for disclosure relating to the suspension of operations of TIO Networks (“TIO”) (which we acquired in July 2017) as part of an investigation of security vulnerabilities of the TIO platform. Actual or perceived vulnerabilities or data breaches have led and may lead to claims against us. In addition, under payment card rules and our contracts with our card processors, if there is a breach of payment card information that we store, or that is stored by our direct payment card processing vendors, we could be liable to the payment card issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses. We also expect to expend significant additional resources to protect against security or privacy breaches and may be required to redress problems caused by breaches. Financial services regulators in various jurisdictions, including the U.S. and the EU, have implemented authentication requirements for banks and payment processors intended to reduce online fraud, which could impose significant costs, require us to change our business practices, make it more difficult for new customers to join PayPal, and reduce the ease of use of our products, which could harm our business. While we maintain insurance policies, they may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches. 15 Table of Contents Systems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our websites, applications, products, or services could harm our business. Our systems and those of our service providers and partners have experienced from time to time, and may experience in the future service interruptions or degradation because of hardware and software defects or malfunctions, distributed denial-of-service and other cyberattacks, insider threats, human error, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, and other natural disasters, power losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist attacks, computer viruses or other malware, or other events. We have experienced from time to time, and may experience in the future, disruptions in our systems due to break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism. Some of our systems, including systems of companies we have acquired, are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all possible outcomes or events. In addition, as a provider of payments solutions, we are subject to heightened scrutiny by regulators that may require specific business continuity, resiliency and disaster recovery plans, and more rigorous testing of such plans, which may be costly and time-consuming to implement, and may divert our resources from other business priorities.We have experienced and expect to continue to experience system failures, denial-of-service attacks, and other events or conditions from time to time that interrupt the availability, or reduce or adversely affect the speed or functionality, of our products and services. These events have resulted and likely will result in loss of revenue. A prolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in the availability, speed, or functionality of our products and services could materially harm our business. Frequent or persistent interruptions in our services could cause current or potential customers or partners to believe that our systems are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid or reduce the use of our products and services, and could permanently harm our reputation and brands. Moreover, if any system failure or similar event results in damages to our customers or their business partners, these customers or partners could seek significant compensation or contractual penalties from us for their losses, and those claims, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and costly for us to address, and could have other consequences described in this “Risk Factors” section under the caption “Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to our reputation, business, and financial condition.”Our Payments Platform has experienced and may in the future experience intermittent unavailability. The full-time availability and expeditious delivery of our products and services is critical to our goal of gaining widespread acceptance among consumers and merchants for digital payments. We have undertaken and continue to undertake certain system upgrades and re-platforming efforts designed to improve our reliability and speed. These efforts are costly and time-consuming, involve significant technical risk and may divert our resources from new features and products, and there can be no guarantee that these efforts will succeed. Because we are a regulated financial institution in certain jurisdictions, frequent or persistent site interruptions could lead to regulatory scrutiny, significant fines and penalties, and mandatory and costly changes to our business practices, and ultimately could cause us to lose existing licenses that we need to operate or prevent or delay us from obtaining additional licenses that may be required for our business.We also rely on facilities, components, applications, and services supplied by third parties, including data center facilities and cloud storage services, which subjects us to risks in the nature of those discussed in this “Risk Factors” section under the captions “We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk.” From time to time, such third parties have ceased to provide us with such facilities and services. Additionally, if these third parties experience operational interference or disruptions, breach their agreements with us, fail to perform their obligations and meet our expectations, or experience a cybersecurity incident, our operations could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected, which could result in customer dissatisfaction, regulatory scrutiny, and damage to our reputation and brands, and materially and adversely affect our business. While we maintain business interruption insurance, our coverage may be insufficient to compensate us for all losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of systems failures and similar events.In addition, we are continually improving and upgrading our information systems and technologies. Implementation of new systems and technologies is complex, expensive, and time-consuming. If we fail to timely and successfully implement new information systems and technologies, or improvements or upgrades to existing information systems and technologies, or if such systems and technologies do not operate as intended, this could have an adverse impact on our business, internal controls (including internal controls over financial reporting), results of operations, and financial condition. 16 Table of Contents Changes to payment card networks or bank fees, rules, or practices could harm our business. We rely on banks or other payment processors to process transactions and pay fees for their services. From time to time, payment card networks have increased, and may continue to increase in the future, the interchange fees and assessments that they charge for transactions that access their networks. Payment card networks have imposed, and may impose in the future, special fees or assessments for transactions that are executed through a digital wallet such as PayPal’s, which could negatively impact us and significantly increase our costs. Our payment card processors may have the right to pass any increases in interchange fees and assessments on to us as well as increase their own fees for processing, which could increase our operating costs and reduce our operating income. We have entered into strategic partnerships with Visa, Mastercard and other credit card networks to further expand our relationships in a way that will make it easier for merchants to accept and consumers to choose to pay with their respective credit cards and debit cards. During the terms of these agreements, Visa and Mastercard have each agreed to not enact or impose any fees or rules that solely target PayPal. Upon termination of the agreements, PayPal could become subject to special digital wallet fees or other special assessments.In addition, in some jurisdictions, government regulations have required payment card networks to reduce or cap interchange fees. Any material change in credit card or debit card interchange rates in the U.S. or other markets, including as a result of changes in interchange fee limitations, could adversely affect our competitive position against traditional payment card service providers and our business, as well as the revenue we earn from our card programs.We are required to comply with payment card network operating rules, including special operating rules for payment service providers to merchants. We have agreed to reimburse our processors for any fines they are assessed by payment card networks resulting from any rule violations by us or our merchants. We may also be directly liable to the payment card networks for rule violations. The payment card networks set and interpret the card operating rules and have alleged from time to time that various aspects of our business model violate these operating rules. If such allegations are not resolved favorably, they may result in significant fines and penalties or require changes in our business practices that may be costly and adversely affect our business. The payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or re-interpret existing rules that we or our processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow, or costly to implement. As a result, we could lose our ability to give consumers the option of using payment cards to fund their payments or the choice of currency in which they would like their payment card to be charged. If we are unable to accept payment cards or are limited in our ability to do so, our business would be adversely affected.We and our payment card processors have implemented specific business processes for merchants to comply with payment card network operating rules for providing services to merchants. Any failure to comply with these rules could result in fines. We are also subject to fines from payment card networks if we fail to detect that merchants are engaging in activities that are illegal or considered “high risk” under their network operating rules, including the sale of certain types of digital content. For “high risk” merchants, we must either prevent such merchants from using PayPal services or register such merchants with the payment card networks and conduct additional monitoring with respect to such merchants. Although the amount of these fines has not been material to date, we could be subject to significant additional fines in the future, which could result in a termination of our ability to accept payment cards or require changes in our process for registering new customers, which would adversely affect our business. Payment card network rules may also increase the cost of, impose restrictions on, or otherwise negatively impact the development of, our retail point-of-sale solutions, which may negatively impact their deployment and adoption. 17 Table of Contents Failure to deal effectively with fraud, fictitious transactions, bad transactions, and negative customer experiences would increase our loss rate and could negatively impact our business and severely diminish merchant and consumer confidence in and use of our services. Our operations process a significant volume and dollar value of transactions on a daily basis. In the event that merchants do not fulfill their obligations to consumers or a merchant's goods or services do not match the merchant’s description, we may incur substantial losses as a result of claims from consumers. We seek to recover such losses from the merchant but we may not fully recover them if the merchant is unwilling or unable to pay. In addition, in the event of the bankruptcy or other business interruption of a merchant that sells goods or services in advance of the date of their delivery or use (e.g., airline, cruise or concert tickets, custom-made goods, and subscriptions), we could be liable to the buyers of such goods or services, either through our buyer protection program or through chargebacks on payment cards used by customers to fund their payments. While we have established allowances for transaction losses based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such losses incurred as of the reporting date, these reserves may be insufficient.We also incur substantial losses from claims that the consumer did not authorize the purchase, fraud, erroneous transactions, and customers who have closed bank accounts or have insufficient funds in their bank accounts to satisfy payments. In addition, if losses incurred by us related to payment card transactions become excessive, they could potentially result in our losing the right to accept payment cards for payment, which would negatively impact our business. We have taken measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud, but these measures require continuous improvement and may not be effective in detecting and preventing fraud, particularly new and continually evolving forms of fraud or in connection with new or expanded product offerings. If these measures do not succeed, our business could be negatively impacted. We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that could materially and adversely affect our financial results. We have significant operations internationally that are denominated in foreign currencies, including the British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar, and Canadian Dollar, which subject us to foreign currency exchange risk. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar versus these foreign currencies impacts the translation of our net revenues generated and expenses incurred in these foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar. In connection with providing our services in multiple currencies, we may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign currency exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the times that we set them. We also hold a portion of our corporate and customer funds in non-U.S. currencies, and our financial results are affected by the remeasurement of these non-U.S. currencies into U.S. dollars. We also have foreign currency exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. While we regularly enter into transactions to hedge foreign currency exchange risk for portions of our foreign currency translation and balance sheet exposure, it is impossible to predict or entirely eliminate the effects of this exposure. Any factors that reduce cross-border trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business. Cross-border trade (i.e., transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries) is an important source of our revenue and profits. Cross-border transactions generally provide higher revenues and operating income than similar transactions that take place within a single country or market. Cross-border trade also represents our primary (and in some cases, our only) presence in certain important markets. Cross-border trade is subject to, and may be negatively impacted by, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, the interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions (e.g., the jurisdiction of the merchant and of the consumer) are often extremely complicated in the context of cross-border trade and foreign exchange. Changes to or the interpretation and/or application of laws and regulations applicable to cross-border trade and foreign exchange could impose additional requirements and restrictions, increase costs, and impose conflicting obligations. Any factors that increase the costs of cross-border trade for us or our customers or that restrict, delay, or make cross-border trade more difficult or impractical, such as trade policy or higher tariffs, could reduce our cross-border transactions and volume, negatively impact our revenues and profits and harm our business. See also the risk factor captioned, “Global and regional economic conditions could harm our business.” 18 Table of Contents Changes in how consumers fund their PayPal transactions could harm our business. We pay transaction fees when consumers fund payment transactions using credit cards, lower fees when consumers fund payments with debit cards, and nominal fees when consumers fund payment transactions by electronic transfer of funds from bank accounts, or from an existing PayPal account balance or through our PayPal branded consumer credit products. Our financial success is sensitive to changes in the rate at which our consumers fund payments using payment cards, which can significantly increase our costs. Although we provide consumers in certain markets with the opportunity to use their existing PayPal account balance to fund payment transactions, some of our consumers may prefer to use payment cards, especially if these payment cards offer features and benefits that are not provided as part of their PayPal accounts. An increase in the portion of our payment volume funded using payment cards or in fees associated with our funding mix, or other events or developments that make it more difficult or costly for us to fund transactions with lower-cost funding options, could materially and adversely affect our financial performance and significantly harm our business.We have entered into strategic partnerships with major payment card networks and/or issuing banks to promote greater consumer choice and make it easier for merchants to accept and consumers to pay with these partners’ credit cards and/or debit cards and to allow us to gain access to these partners’ tokenization services for in-store point of sale PayPal transactions. These arrangements may have an uncertain impact on our business. While we anticipate that these and similar strategic partnerships we may enter into in the future will result in an increase in the number of transactions and transaction volume that we process, we also anticipate that a greater percentage of customer transactions will be executed using a payment card, which would likely increase the transaction costs associated with our funding mix, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and profitability. The United Kingdom’s departure from the EU could adversely affect us. The United Kingdom (“U.K.”) held a referendum in June 2016 in which a majority of voters approved an exit from the European Union (“EU”) (commonly referred to as “Brexit”). The U.K. formally exited the EU on January 31, 2020 and a transition period is in place until December 31, 2020 during which time the U.K. will remain in both the EU customs union and single market and follow EU rules. There is a significant lack of clarity over the terms of the U.K.'s future relationship with the EU after this date. Brexit could therefore adversely affect U.K., regional (including European), and worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign currency exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the British Pound and Euro, which in turn could adversely affect us or our customers and companies with which we do business, particularly in the U.K. Brexit could lead to greater restrictions on the supply and availability of goods and services between the U.K. and the EEA region, with the potential inability of U.K. companies to fulfill orders which could lead to a risk of increased merchant defaults and buyer protection claims. Brexit could also trigger a general deterioration in credit conditions, a downturn in consumer sentiment, and overall negative economic growth. Any of these scenarios could have an adverse effect on our business or our customers.In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and increased complexity for financial services firms as national laws and regulations in the U.K. start to diverge from EU laws and regulations. In particular, depending on the terms of Brexit, we may face new regulatory costs and challenges, including the following:•if we are unable to utilize appropriate authorizations and regulatory permissions, our European operations could lose their ability to offer services into the U.K. market on a cross-border basis and for our U.K. based operations to offer services on a cross-border basis in the European markets. For example, our ability to work primarily with the Luxembourg regulator as the lead authority for various aspects of the U.K. operations of PayPal (Europe) S.à.r.l. et Cie., SCA (“PayPal (Europe)”) and with the Swedish regulator for various aspects of the U.K. operations of iZettle AB (“iZettle”) may be impacted; •we could be required to obtain additional regulatory permissions to operate in the U.K. market, adding costs and potential inconsistency to our business. Depending on the capacity of the U.K. authorities, the criteria for obtaining permission, and any possible transitional arrangements, our business in the U.K. could be materially affected or disrupted; •we could be required to comply with legal and regulatory requirements in the U.K. that are in addition to, or inconsistent with, those of the EU, leading to increased complexity and costs for our European and U.K. operations; and•our ability to attract and retain the necessary human resources in appropriate locations to support our U.K. and European business could be adversely impacted.These and other factors related to Brexit could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 19 Table of Contents Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight. Our failure to comply with extensive, complex, overlapping, and frequently changing rules, regulations, and legal interpretations could materially harm our business. Our business is subject to laws, rules, regulations, policies, and legal interpretations in the markets in which we operate, including, but not limited to, those governing:•banking, •credit, •deposit taking, •cross-border and domestic money transmission, •prepaid access, •foreign currency exchange, •privacy, •data governance,•data protection, •cybersecurity, •banking secrecy, •fraud detection,•payment services (including payment processing and settlement services), •consumer protection, •antitrust and competition,•economic and trade sanctions, •anti-money laundering, and •counter-terrorist financing. Our success and increased visibility may result in increased regulatory oversight and enforcement and more restrictive rules and regulations that apply to our business.As we expand and localize our international activities, we have become increasingly obligated to comply with the laws of the markets in which we operate. In addition, because our services are accessible worldwide and we facilitate sales of goods and provide services to customers worldwide, one or more jurisdictions may claim that we or our customers are required to comply with their laws. Laws regulating the internet, mobile, and related technologies outside of the U.S. often impose different, more specific, or even conflicting obligations on us, as well as broader liability. For example, certain transactions that may be permissible in a local jurisdiction may be prohibited by regulations of U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) or U.S. anti-money laundering or counter-terrorist financing regulations.Any failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or new laws, regulations, or orders of any government authority (including changes to or expansion of the interpretation of those laws, regulations, or orders), including those discussed in this risk factor, may subject us to significant fines, penalties, criminal and civil lawsuits, forfeiture of significant assets, and enforcement actions in one or more jurisdictions; result in additional compliance and licensure requirements; cause us to lose existing licenses or prevent or delay us from obtaining additional licenses that may be required for our business; increase regulatory scrutiny of our business; restrict our operations; and force us to change our business practices, make product or operational changes, or delay planned transactions, product launches or improvements. Any of the foregoing could, individually or in the aggregate, harm our reputation, damage our brands and business, and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The complexity of U.S. federal and state and international regulatory and enforcement regimes, coupled with the global scope of our operations and the evolving global regulatory environment, could result in a single event prompting a large number of overlapping investigations and legal and regulatory proceedings by multiple government authorities in different jurisdictions. We have implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, and agents will not violate such laws and regulations. 20 Table of Contents Payments Regulation In the U.S., PayPal, Inc. has obtained licenses to operate as a money transmitter (or its equivalent) in the states where such licenses are required, as well as in the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. These licenses include not only the PayPal branded products and services in these states, but also our Braintree, Venmo, and Xoom products and services. We may also maintain such licenses for certain companies that we have acquired, such as Hyperwallet. As a licensed money transmitter, PayPal is subject to, among other requirements, restrictions with respect to the investment of customer funds, reporting requirements, bonding requirements, and inspection by state regulatory agencies. Accordingly, if we violate these laws or regulations, we could be subject to liability and/or additional restrictions, forced to cease doing business with residents of certain states, forced to change our business practices, or required to obtain additional licenses or regulatory approvals, which could impose substantial costs.While we currently allow our customers with payment cards to send payments from approximately 200 markets, we allow customers in only approximately half of those markets (including the U.S.) to also receive payments, in some cases with significant restrictions on the manner in which customers can hold balances or withdraw funds. These limitations may adversely affect our ability to grow our business in these markets.We principally provide our services to customers in the EU through PayPal (Europe), our wholly-owned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a credit institution in Luxembourg. Accordingly, PayPal (Europe) is potentially subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if it violates the disclosure, reporting, anti-money laundering, capitalization, corporate governance, privacy, data protection, data governance, information security, banking secrecy, taxation, risk management, sanctions, or other requirements imposed on Luxembourg credit institutions. In addition, EU laws and regulations are subject to potentially inconsistent interpretations by the countries that are members of the EU, which can make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage. Moreover, the countries that are EU members may each have different and potentially inconsistent domestic regulations implementing European Directives, which could make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage. The Revised Payment Services Directive (“PSD2”) took effect in Europe in 2018, with certain requirements becoming applicable from 2019 or later. PSD2 enables new payment and information sharing models whereby regulated payment providers are able to access bank and payment accounts (including PayPal accounts) for the purposes of accessing account information or initiating a payment on behalf of a customer. Such access could subject us to data security and other legal and financial risks and could create new competitive forces and new types of competitors in the European payments market. PSD2 also imposes new standards for payment security and strong customer authentication (“SCA”) that may make it more difficult and time consuming to carry out a PayPal transaction, which may adversely impact PayPal’s European customer value proposition. SCA was implemented in 2019. In line with an opinion issued by the European Banking Authority (“EBA”), national competent authorities (including Luxembourg) have announced enforcement deferral periods for migration to SCA requirements for e-commerce card-based transactions. PayPal (Europe) has implemented SCA customer processes covering the majority of payment transactions initiated within the EU and has plans to finalize full compliance with SCA; amending or accelerating these plans may adversely impact PayPal’s European customer value proposition.If the business activities of PayPal (Europe) exceed certain thresholds, or if the European Central Bank (“ECB”) so determines, PayPal (Europe) may be deemed a significant supervised entity such that some activity of PayPal (Europe) could become directly regulated by the ECB rather than the CSSF, the Luxembourg regulator , as its national supervisor, which could subject us to additional requirements and would likely increase compliance costs.In many of the other markets outside the U.S. in which we do business, we serve our customers through PayPal Pte. Ltd., our wholly-owned subsidiary based in Singapore. PayPal Pte. Ltd. is supervised by the Monetary Authority of Singapore and designated as a holder of a stored value facility, but does not hold a remittance license. As a result, PayPal Pte. Ltd. is not able to offer outbound remittance payments from Singapore, and can only offer payments for the purchase of goods and services in Singapore. In many of the markets (other than Singapore) served by PayPal Pte. Ltd., it is unclear and uncertain whether our Singapore-based service is subject only to Singapore law or, if it is subject to the application of local laws, whether such local laws would require a payment processor like us to be licensed as a payments service, bank, financial institution, or otherwise. The Payment Services Act (“PS Act”) passed into law in Singapore in January 2019 and is expected to come into effect in 2020. Under the PS Act, PayPal Pte. Ltd. will be required to apply for a license to continue to provide payments services in Singapore. Furthermore, once the PS Act comes into force and is fully implemented, we may face new regulatory costs and challenges, including the following:•we could be required to comply with new regulatory requirements, resulting in increased complexity and costs for our Singapore and international operations;•we could be required to make changes to our compliance program, resulting in increased complexity and costs to operate both in Singapore as well as in the cross-border markets which are served by PayPal Pte. Ltd; and•we could be required to comply with additional safeguarding requirements, which could increase our operational costs.In certain markets outside the U.S. (e.g., Australia), we provide our services to customers through a local subsidiary subject to local regulatory supervision or oversight, which may be the holder of a local payment license, certification, or other authorization. In such markets, we may be subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if we violate applicable reporting, anti-money laundering, capital requirements, privacy, corporate governance, risk management, or any other applicable requirements.PayPal Australia Pty Limited (“PPAU”) self-reported a potential violation to the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (“AUSTRAC”) on May 22, 2019 with respect to the reporting of international funds transfer instructions under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (“AML/CTF Act”). Please see Note 13—Commitments and Contingencies—Litigation and Regulatory Matters—for additional disclosure regarding this matter. From time to time, we may acquire entities subject to local regulatory supervision or oversight. For example, in December 2019, we completed our acquisition of a 70% equity stake in Guofubao Information Technology Co. (GoPay), Ltd. (“GoPay”), a provider of online payment services in China. GoPay holds a number of payment business licenses in China and is subject to regulatory supervision by the People’s Bank of China and other regulatory bodies. We have been, and expect to continue to be, required to apply for various licenses, certifications, and regulatory approvals in a number of the jurisdictions where we provide our services, including due to changes in applicable laws and regulations or the interpretation of such laws and regulations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to (or decide to) obtain any such licenses, certifications, and approvals. In addition, there are substantial costs and potential product changes involved in maintaining and renewing such licenses, certifications, and approvals, and we could be subject to fines, other enforcement action, and litigation if we are found to violate disclosure, reporting, anti-money laundering, capitalization, corporate governance, or other requirements of such licenses. These factors could impose substantial additional costs, involve considerable delay to the development or provision of our products or services, require significant and costly operational changes, or prevent us from providing our products or services in a given market.In many countries, it may not be clear whether we are required to be licensed as a payment services provider, bank, financial institution, or otherwise. In such markets, we may rely on local banks to process payments and conduct foreign currency exchange transactions in local currency. Local regulators may use their authority to slow or halt payments to local merchants conducted through local banks or otherwise prohibit or impede us from doing business in a jurisdiction. Such regulatory actions or the need to obtain licenses, certifications, or other regulatory approvals could impose substantial costs, involve considerable delay to the provision or development of our services, require significant and costly operational changes, impose restrictions, limitations, or additional requirements on our business, or prevent us from providing any products or services in a given market. 21 Table of Contents 22 Table of Contents Consumer Protection We are subject to consumer protection, antitrust and competition-related laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. In the U.S., we are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations applicable to our activities, including the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (“EFTA”) and Regulation E as implemented by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). These regulations require us to provide advance disclosure of changes to our services, follow specified error resolution procedures, and reimburse consumers for losses from certain transactions not authorized by the consumer. Additionally, technical violations of consumer protection laws could result in the assessment of actual damages or statutory damages or penalties of up to $1,000 in individual cases or up to $500,000 per violation in any class action and treble damages in some instances; we could also be liable for plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees in such cases. We are subject to, and have paid amounts in settlement of, lawsuits containing allegations that our business violated the EFTA and Regulation E or otherwise advance claims for relief relating to our business practices (e.g., that we improperly held consumer funds or otherwise improperly limited consumer accounts).The CFPB issued a final rule on prepaid accounts that came into effect on April 1, 2019. The rule’s definition of prepaid account includes certain accounts that are capable of being loaded with funds and whose primary function is to conduct transactions with multiple, unaffiliated merchants, at ATMs and/or for P2P transfers. That definition includes certain digital wallets. The rule’s requirements include, among other things, the disclosure of fees and other information to the consumer prior to the creation of a prepaid account; the extension of Regulation E liability limits and error-resolution requirements to all prepaid accounts; the application of Regulation Z credit card requirements to prepaid accounts with overdraft and credit features; and the submission of prepaid account agreements to the CFPB and their publication to the general public. We have implemented certain changes to comply with the final rule and made substantial changes to the design of certain U.S. consumer accounts and their operability, which could lead to unintended customer confusion and dissatisfaction, discourage customers from opening new accounts, require us to reallocate resources, and increase our costs, which could negatively affect our business. In December 2019, we filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the CFPB challenging the validity of the prepaid account rule as applied to PayPal, Inc. As with any litigation, there is no guarantee that our claims will succeed.In May 2015, we entered into a Stipulated Final Judgment and Consent Order (“Consent Order”) with the CFPB in which we settled regulatory claims arising from PayPal Credit practices between 2011 and 2015. The Consent Order included obligations of PayPal to pay $15 million in redress to consumers and a $10 million civil monetary penalty, and required PayPal to make various changes to PayPal Credit disclosures and related business practices. We continue to cooperate and engage with the CFPB and work to ensure compliance with the Consent Order, which may result in us incurring additional costs.PayPal principally offers its services in EEA countries through a “passport” notification process through the Luxembourg regulator (in the case of PayPal (Europe)) or the Swedish regulator (in the case of iZettle AB) to regulators in other EEA member states in accordance with EU regulations. Regulators in these countries could notify us of local consumer protection laws that apply to our business, in addition to Luxembourg or Swedish consumer protection laws, and could also seek to persuade the local regulator to order PayPal to conduct its activities in the local country directly or through a branch office. Similarly, as a result of Brexit, the U.K. regulators may impose new or different legal requirements on our U.K. business, or require our activities to be conducted locally in the U.K. through a branch office or directly. These or similar actions by these regulators could increase the cost of, or delay, our plans to expand our business in EEA countries. Economic and Trade Sanctions We are required to comply with economic and trade sanctions administered by the U.S, the EU, relevant EU member states, and other jurisdictions in which we operate. We have self-reported to OFAC certain transactions that were inadvertently processed but subsequently identified as possible violations of U.S. economic and trade sanctions. In March 2015, we reached a settlement with OFAC regarding possible violations arising from our sanctions compliance practices between 2009 and 2013, prior to the implementation of our real-time transaction scanning program. Subsequently, we have self-reported additional transactions as possible violations, and we have received new subpoenas from OFAC seeking additional information about certain of these transactions. Such self-reported transactions could result in claims or actions against us, including litigation, injunctions, damage awards, fines or penalties, or require us to change our business practices in a manner that could result in a material loss, require significant management time, result in the diversion of significant operational resources, or otherwise harm our business. 23 Table of Contents Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing We are subject to various anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws and regulations around the world that prohibit, among other things, our involvement in transferring the proceeds of criminal activities. Regulators in the U.S. and other regulators globally continue to increase their scrutiny of compliance with these obligations, which may require us to further revise or expand our compliance program, including the procedures we use to verify the identity of our customers and to monitor international and domestic transactions. Many countries in which we operate also have anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws and regulations, and we have been and will continue to be required to make changes to our compliance program in various jurisdictions in response. Such changes could have the effect of making compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage, lead to increased friction for customers, and result in a decrease in business. Regulators regularly re-examine the transaction volume thresholds at which we must obtain and keep applicable records or verify identities of customers and any change in such thresholds could result in greater costs for compliance. Non-compliance with anti-money laundering laws may subject us to significant fines, penalties, lawsuits, and enforcement actions, result in regulatory sanctions and additional compliance requirements, increase regulatory scrutiny of our business, restrict our operations or damage our reputation and brands. In the EU, for example, penalties for non-compliance with anti-money laundering laws could include fines of up to 10% of PayPal (Europe)’s total annual turnover. Privacy and Protection of User Data We are subject to a number of laws, rules, directives, and regulations (which we refer to as “privacy and data protection laws”) relating to the collection, use, retention, security, processing, and transfer (which we collectively refer to as “processing”) of personally identifiable information about our customers and employees (which we refer to as “personal data”) in the countries where we operate. Our business relies on the processing of personal data in many jurisdictions and the movement of data across national borders. As a result, much of the personal data that we process, which may include certain financial information associated with individuals, is regulated by multiple privacy and data protection laws and, in some cases, the privacy and data protection laws of multiple jurisdictions. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between or among us, our subsidiaries, and other parties with which we have commercial relationships.Regulatory scrutiny of privacy, data protection, cybersecurity practices, and the processing of personal data is increasing around the world. There is uncertainty associated with the legal and regulatory environment relating to privacy and data protection laws, which continue to develop in ways we cannot predict, including with respect to evolving technologies such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and blockchain technology. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or new laws of any government authority (including changes to or expansion of the interpretation of those laws), including those discussed in this risk factor, may subject us to significant fines, penalties, civil lawsuits, and enforcement actions in one or more jurisdictions, result in additional compliance requirements, increase regulatory scrutiny of our business, restrict our operations, and force us to change our business practices, make product or operational changes, or delay planned product launches or improvements.Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our privacy policies as communicated to users in one or more jurisdictions could result in proceedings or actions against us by data protection authorities, government entities or others, including class action privacy litigation in certain jurisdictions. Such proceedings or actions could subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments, and negative publicity which may materially harm our business. The foregoing may require us to change our business practices and would likely increase the costs and complexity of compliance. In addition, compliance with inconsistent privacy and data protection laws may restrict our ability to provide products and services to our customers.PayPal relies on a variety of compliance methods to transfer personal data of EEA individuals to the U.S., including reliance on Binding Corporate Rules (“BCRs”) for internal transfers of certain types of personal data and Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”) as approved by the European Commission for transfers to and from third parties. PayPal must also ensure that third parties processing personal data of PayPal’s EEA customers and/or employees outside of the EEA have compliant transfer mechanisms. In October 2015, the European Court of Justice invalidated U.S.-EU Safe Harbor framework clauses that were previously relied upon by some PayPal vendors to lawfully transfer personal data of EU citizens to U.S. companies, and PayPal entered into SCCs with those third parties which had previously relied on the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor framework. In July 2016, the U.S. and EU authorities agreed on a replacement for the Safe Harbor framework known as “Privacy Shield.” Both the Privacy Shield framework and SCCs continue to face legal challenges in the European justice system. To the extent that the Privacy Shield or SCCs are invalidated, PayPal’s ability to process EEA personal data with third parties outside of the EEA and intra-group with its U.S. affiliates could be jeopardized. 24 Table of Contents If one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their financial or performance obligations to us or fail, we may incur significant losses. We have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents, receivables outstanding, and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the U.S. and abroad. As part of our currency hedging activities, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments with various financial institutions. Certain banks and financial institutions are also lenders under our credit facilities. We regularly monitor our exposure to counterparty credit risk, and actively manage this exposure to mitigate the associated risk. Despite these efforts, we may be exposed to the risk of default by, or deteriorating operating results or financial condition or failure of, these counterparty financial institutions. The risk of counterparty default, deterioration, or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets. If one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or to access or recover our assets that are deposited, held in accounts with, or otherwise due from, such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty’s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties, we could incur significant losses, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. PayPal is not a bank or licensed lender in the U.S. and relies upon third parties to make loans and provide other products critical to our business, which raises additional risks. As PayPal is neither a chartered financial institution, nor licensed to make loans in any state in the U.S., we rely on third-party chartered financial institutions to provide PayPal branded credit products to our customers in the U.S., including consumer credit products such as PayPal Credit, PayPal branded credit cards, and merchant credit products such as PayPal Working Capital and PayPal Business Loan products. Any termination or interruption in a partner bank’s ability or willingness to lend could interrupt or limit our ability to offer consumer credit and merchant credit products, which could materially and adversely affect our business. In the event of a partner bank’s inability or unwillingness to lend, we may be unable to reach a similar agreement with another charter financial institution on favorable terms or at all. Obtaining a bank charter or lending licenses would be a costly, time-consuming and uncertain process, and would subject us to additional laws and regulatory requirements, which could significantly increase our costs and compliance obligations and require us to change our business practices, which could materially and adversely affect our business. In addition, as a service provider to these bank partners, which are federally supervised U.S. financial institutions, we are subject from time to time to examination by their federal banking regulators.In July 2018, we completed the sale of our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio to Synchrony Bank. As a part of a separate agreement, PayPal earns a revenue share on the portfolio of consumer receivables owned by Synchrony Bank, which includes both the sold and newly generated receivables, and we do not hold an ownership interest in newly generated consumer credit receivables. It may take us longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction, and those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. In addition, our increased reliance on, and credit exposure to, Synchrony Bank, including in connection with this agreement, subjects us to risks in the nature of those discussed in this “Risk Factors” section under the captions “We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk” and “If one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their financial or performance obligations to us or fail, we may incur significant losses.” Our ability to receive the benefit of our business finance offerings may be subject to challenge. Merchant loans and advances under our PayPal Working Capital and PayPal Business Loan products are provided by a state chartered industrial bank under a program agreement with us. We acquire the receivables generated by those loans after origination.A case decided in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, Madden v. Midland Funding, LLC (786 F.3d 246 (2d Cir. 2015)), resulted in uncertainty as to whether non-bank entities purchasing loans originated by a bank may rely on federal preemption of state usury laws, and may create an increased risk of litigation by plaintiffs challenging our ability to collect interest and fees in accordance with the terms of certain loans. The decision, which specifically addressed preemption under the National Bank Act, could support future challenges to federal preemption for other institutions, including FDIC-insured, state chartered industrial banks like the issuing bank of loans and advances under PayPal Working Capital and PayPal Business Loan products. There continue to be a number of U.S. state and federal court legal actions challenging the viability of business models where a non-bank entity enters into a relationship with a third-party chartered financial institution for the issuance of credit products. While we believe the manner in which PayPal branded credit products are offered can be distinguished from Madden, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of any potential litigation, and an adverse determination could materially impact our PayPal Working Capital and PayPal Business Loan products and our business. 25 Table of Contents Some of our credit products expose us to additional risks. We offer our PayPal Credit consumer product and our PayPal Working Capital and PayPal Business Loan products to a wide range of consumers and merchants in various markets, and the financial success of these products depends on the effective management of related risk. The credit decision-making process for the PayPal Credit consumer product uses proprietary segmentation and credit algorithms and other analytical techniques designed to analyze the credit risk of specific consumers based on, among other factors, their past purchasing and payment history with PayPal as well as their credit scores. Similarly, proprietary risk models and other indicators are applied to assess merchants who desire to use our business finance offerings to help predict their ability to repay. These risk models may not accurately predict the creditworthiness of a consumer or merchant due to factors such as inaccurate assumptions, including assumptions related to the particular consumer or merchant, market conditions, economic environment, or limited transaction history or other data, among other factors. The accuracy of these risk models and the ability to manage credit risk related to our credit products may also be affected by legal or regulatory requirements, competitors’ actions, changes in consumer behavior, changes in the economic environment, and other factors. Our international expansion of our credit product offerings expose us to additional risks, including those discussed in the risk factor captioned “Our international operations subject us to increased risks, which could harm our business.”Like other businesses with significant exposure to losses from merchant credit, we face the risk that account holders will default on their payment obligations, creating the risk of potential charge-offs. We face similar risks with respect to U.S. consumer credit losses through the profit-sharing arrangement with Synchrony Bank. The non-payment rate among account holders may increase due to, among other factors, changes to underwriting standards, risk models not accurately predicting the creditworthiness of a consumer, worsening economic conditions, such as a recession or government austerity programs, increases in prevailing interest rates, and high unemployment rates. Account holders who miss payments often fail to repay their loans, and account holders who file for protection under the bankruptcy laws generally do not repay their loans.We currently purchase receivables related to the PayPal branded merchant credit products in the U.S. If we are unable to fund our purchase of these receivables adequately or in a cost-effective manner, or if we are unable to efficiently manage the cash resources utilized for these purposes, our business could be harmed. Catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business War, terrorism, political events, geopolitical instability, trade barriers and restrictions, public health issues, natural disasters, or other catastrophic events have caused and could cause damage or disruption to the economy and commerce on a global, regional, or country-specific basis, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, our customers, and companies with which we do business. Such events could decrease demand for our products and services or make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products and services to our customers. Geopolitical trends, including nationalism, protectionism, and restrictive visa requirements could limit the expansion of our business in those regions. Our corporate headquarters are located in the Silicon Valley, which is a seismically active region in California. Our business operations are subject to interruption by, among others, natural disasters, fire, power shortages, earthquakes, floods, nuclear power plant accidents, and events beyond our control such as other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes and public health issues. A catastrophic event that results in a disruption or failure of our systems or operations could result in significant losses and require substantial recovery time and significant expenditures in order to resume or maintain operations, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Changes to our buyer and seller protection programs could increase our loss rate. Our buyer and seller protection programs protect merchants and consumers from fraudulent transactions, and protect consumers if they do not receive the item ordered or if the item received is significantly different from its description. In addition, consumers who pay through PayPal may have reimbursement rights from their payment card issuer (usually a bank), which in turn will seek recovery from us. The risk of losses from our buyer and seller protection programs are specific to individual buyers, sellers, and transactions, and may also be impacted by regional variations to these programs, modifications to these programs resulting from changes in regulatory requirements, or changes that we decide to implement, such as expanding the scope of transactions covered by one or more of these programs. Increases in our loss rate, including as a result of changes to our buyer and seller protection programs, could negatively impact our business. 26 Table of Contents Our international operations subject us to increased risks, which could harm our business. Our international operations have generated approximately one-half of our net revenues in recent years. There are risks inherent in doing business internationally on both a domestic (i.e., in-country) and cross-border basis, including, but not limited to:•foreign currency exchange and cross-border trade risks discussed earlier in this “Risk Factors” section under the captions “We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that could materially and adversely affect our financial results” and “Any factors that reduce cross-border trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business”;•risks related to government regulation or required compliance with local laws;•local licensing and reporting obligations;•local regulatory and legal obligations related to privacy, data protection, data localization, and user protections; •costs and challenges associated with localizing our products and services, including offering customers the ability to transact business in the local currency and adapting our products and services to local preferences (e.g., payment methods), in markets in which we may have limited or no experience;•trade barriers and changes in trade regulations;•difficulties in developing, staffing, and simultaneously managing a large number of varying foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences;•stringent local labor laws and regulations;•credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;•profit repatriation restrictions; •political or social unrest, economic instability, repression, or human rights issues;•geopolitical instability, natural disasters, public health issues, acts of war, and terrorism;•import or export regulations;•compliance with U.S. laws and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, and other local anticorruption laws;•compliance with U.S. and foreign laws designed to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities;•antitrust and competition regulations;•potentially adverse tax developments and consequences;•economic uncertainties relating to sovereign and other debt;•national or regional differences in macroeconomic growth rates; and•increased difficulties in collecting accounts receivable.Violations of the complex foreign and U.S. laws, rules and regulations that apply to our international operations may result in fines, criminal actions, or sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies. These risks are inherent in our international operations and expansion, may increase our costs of doing business internationally, and could harm our business. We are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates. We are exposed to interest rate risk from our investment portfolio and from interest-rate sensitive assets, including assets underlying the customer balances we hold on our balance sheet as customer accounts. A low or negative interest rate environment or reductions in interest rates may negatively impact our net income. In addition, fluctuations in interest rates may adversely impact our customers’ spending levels and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amounts owed to us. Higher interest rates often lead to higher payment obligations by customers to us and other lenders under mortgage, credit card, and other consumer and merchant loans, which may reduce our customers’ ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore lead to increased delinquencies, charge-offs, and allowances for loan and interest receivables, which could have an adverse effect on our net income.We have entered into a five-year revolving credit facility and a 364-day revolving credit facility as well as other committed and uncommitted credit facilities around the world. We have borrowed under our credit facilities from time to time, and any borrowings under these credit facilities that bear interest at a floating rate would expose us to interest rate fluctuations. 27 Table of Contents Use of our payments services for illegal purposes could harm our business. Our payment system is susceptible to potentially illegal or improper uses, including money laundering, terrorist financing, illegal online gambling, fraudulent sales of goods or services, illegal sales of prescription medications or controlled substances, piracy of software, movies, music, and other copyrighted or trademarked goods (in particular, digital goods), bank fraud, child pornography, human trafficking, prohibited sales of alcoholic beverages or tobacco products, securities fraud, pyramid or ponzi schemes, or the facilitation of other illegal activity. The use of our payment system for illegal or improper uses has subjected us, and may subject us in the future, to claims, individual and class action lawsuits, and government and regulatory investigations, inquiries, or requests that could result in liability and reputational harm for us. Moreover, certain activity that may be legal in one jurisdiction may be illegal in another jurisdiction, and a merchant may be found responsible for intentionally or inadvertently importing or exporting illegal goods, resulting in liability for us. Changes in law have increased the penalties for intermediaries providing payment services for certain illegal activities, and government authorities may consider additional payments-related proposals from time to time. Owners of intellectual property rights or government authorities may seek to bring legal action against providers of payments solutions, including PayPal, that are peripherally involved in the sale of infringing or allegedly infringing items. Any threatened or resulting claims could result in reputational harm, and any resulting liabilities, loss of transaction volume, or increased costs could harm our business. Our failure to manage our customer funds and the assets underlying our customer funds properly could harm our business. We hold a substantial amount of funds belonging to our customers, including balances in customer accounts and funds being remitted to sellers of goods and services or recipients of P2P transactions. In certain jurisdictions where we operate, we are required to hold eligible liquid assets (as defined by the relevant regulator in such jurisdiction) equal to at least 100% of the aggregate amount of all customer balances. Our ability to manage and accurately account for the assets underlying our customer funds and comply with applicable liquid asset requirements requires a high level of internal controls. As our business continues to grow and we expand our product offerings, we must continue to strengthen our associated internal controls. PayPal (Europe), with the permission of the CSSF, utilizes certain European customer balances held by our Luxembourg banking subsidiary to fund credit balances relating to certain customers. Our success requires significant public confidence in our ability to properly manage our customers’ balances and handle large and growing transaction volumes and amounts of customer funds. Any failure to maintain the necessary controls or to manage our customer funds and the assets underlying our customer funds accurately and in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements could result in reputational harm, lead customers to discontinue or reduce their use of our products, and result in significant penalties and fines and additional restrictions, which could materially harm our business. We are subject to regulatory activity and legal proceedings under antitrust and competition laws. We are subject to scrutiny by various government agencies regarding antitrust and competition laws and regulations in the U.S. and internationally, including in connection with proposed business combinations, acquisitions, and investments. Some jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to assert claims of anticompetitive conduct. Other companies and government agencies have in the past and may in the future allege that our actions violate the antitrust or competition laws of the U.S., individual states, other countries, or the EU, or otherwise constitute unfair competition. Some regulators and legislators, particularly those outside of the U.S., may perceive that our products and services are used so broadly that otherwise uncontroversial business practices could be deemed anticompetitive. Any claims or investigations, even if without merit, may be very expensive to defend or respond to, involve negative publicity, and substantial diversion of management time and effort, and could result in reputational harm, significant judgments, fines or remedial actions against us, or require us to change our business practices, make product or operational changes, or delay or preclude planned transactions, product launches or improvements. We are subject to patent litigation. We have been sued repeatedly for allegedly infringing other parties’ patents. At any given time, we are typically a defendant in a number of patent lawsuits. We expect that we will continue to be subject to patent infringement claims because, among other reasons:•our products and services continue to expand in scope and complexity and to converge with technologies not previously associated with the payments space;•we continue to expand into new business areas, including through acquisitions; and•the number of patent owners who may claim that we, any of the companies that we have acquired, or our customers infringe their patents, and the aggregate number of patents controlled by such patent owners, continues to increase.Such claims may be brought directly against us or against our users, whom we may indemnify due to contractual obligations or as a business matter. We believe that many of the claims against us and other technology companies have been, and continue to be, initiated by third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims. We vigorously defend against patent infringement claims. In addition, we have seen significant patent disputes between operating companies in some technology industries. Patent claims, whether meritorious or not, could be time-consuming, divert management’s resources, be costly to manage, defend, and resolve and lead to attempts by other parties to pursue similar claims. Additionally, patent claims could require us to make expensive changes in our methods of doing business, enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements, make substantial payments to satisfy adverse judgments or settle claims or proceedings, or cease conducting certain operations, which would harm our business. 28 Table of Contents We may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or third parties may allege that we are infringing their intellectual property rights. The protection of our intellectual property, including our trademarks, patents, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, and trade secrets, is important to the success of our business. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on applicable laws and regulations in the U.S. and internationally, as well as a variety of administrative procedures. We also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights when offering or procuring products and services, including confidentiality and invention assignment agreements entered into with our employees and contractors and confidentiality agreements with parties with whom we conduct business.Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we offer our products and services. We may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our rights.Although we have generally taken measures to protect our intellectual property rights, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in protecting or enforcing our rights in every jurisdiction, or that contractual arrangements and other steps that we have taken to protect our intellectual property will prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our intellectual property or deter independent development of equivalent or superior intellectual property rights by others. If we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting, registering, or using trademarks and trade dress that infringe, dilute, or otherwise violate our trademark rights, the value of our brands could be diminished and our business could be adversely affected. We may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. We have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to others. These licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation. Any failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or significant costs incurred in doing so, could diminish the value of our intangible assets and materially harm our business.As the number of products in the technology and payments industries increases and the functionality of these products further overlaps, and as we acquire technology through acquisitions or licenses, we may become increasingly subject to intellectual property infringement and other claims. Litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of the patent and other intellectual property rights of others. The ultimate outcome of any allegation is often uncertain and, regardless of the outcome, any such claim, with or without merit, may be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert management’s time and attention from our business, and require us to, among other things, redesign or stop providing our products or services, pay substantial amounts to satisfy judgments or settle claims or lawsuits, pay substantial royalty or licensing fees, or satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with certain parties with whom we have commercial relationships. Our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights, or litigation or claims arising out of intellectual property matters, may harm or restrict our business. We are regularly subject to general litigation, regulatory actions, and government inquiries. We are regularly subject to claims, individual and class action lawsuits, government and regulatory investigations, inquiries, actions or requests, and other proceedings alleging violations of laws, rules, and regulations with respect to competition, antitrust, intellectual property, privacy, data protection, information security, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, sanctions, anti-corruption, consumer protection, fraud, accessibility, securities, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, services, charitable fundraising, contract disputes, escheatment of unclaimed or abandoned property, the matters described in Note 13—“Commitments and Contingencies—Litigation and Regulatory Matters—General Matters” to our consolidated financial statements, and other matters. In particular, our business faces ongoing consumer protection and intellectual property litigation, as discussed above. The number and significance of these disputes and inquiries may increase as our business expands in scale, scope and geographic reach, and our products and services increase in scale and complexity. In addition, the laws, rules and regulations affecting our business, including those pertaining to internet and mobile commerce, data protection, payments services, and credit, are subject to ongoing interpretation by the courts and government authorities, and the resulting uncertainty in their scope and application increases the risk that we will be subject to private claims and government actions alleging violations.The scope, outcome, and impact of claims, lawsuits, government investigations, disputes, and proceedings to which we are subject cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of the outcome, such matters can have an adverse impact, which may be material, on our business, results of operations, or financial condition because of legal costs, diversion of management resources, reputational damage, and other factors. Determining reserves for our pending litigation and regulatory proceedings is a complex, fact-intensive process that involves a high degree of judgment. Resolving one or more of such legal and regulatory proceedings or other matters could potentially require us to make substantial payments to satisfy judgments, fines, or penalties or to settle claims or proceedings, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. These proceedings could also result in reputational harm, criminal sanctions, consent decrees, or orders that prevent us from offering certain products or services, require us to change our business practices in costly ways, or develop non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies. Any of these consequences could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.While certain of our customer agreements contain arbitration provisions with class action waiver provisions that may limit our exposure to consumer class action litigation, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in enforcing these arbitration provisions, including the class action waiver provisions, in the future or in any given case. Legislative, administrative, or regulatory developments may directly or indirectly prohibit or limit the use of pre-dispute arbitration clauses and class action waiver provisions. Any such prohibitions or limitations on or discontinuation of the use of, such arbitration or class action waiver provisions could subject us to additional lawsuits, including additional consumer class action litigation, and significantly limit our ability to avoid exposure from consumer class action litigation. 29 Table of Contents Changes in U.S. tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations, and financial conditions. In December 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive Federal tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act made changes to the corporate tax rate, business-related deductions, and taxation of foreign earnings, among others, that are generally effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. Throughout 2018 and 2019, the U.S. Treasury and certain states issued proposed and final legislation and clarifying guidance with respect to the various provisions of the Tax Act. Additional legislation and guidance is expected to be issued in 2020 and could have a material adverse impact on the value of our U.S. deferred tax assets, result in significant changes to currently computed income tax liabilities for past and current tax periods, and increase our future U.S. tax expense. The implementation by us of new practices and processes designed to comply with, and benefit from, the Tax Act and its rules and regulations could require us to make substantial changes to our business practices, allocate additional resources, and increase our costs, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities. The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation and significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Like many other multinational corporations, we are subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Our determination of our tax liability is always subject to audit and review by applicable domestic and foreign authorities, and we are currently undergoing a number of investigations, audits, and reviews by authorities throughout the world. Any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could have a negative effect on our business, and the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the periods for which such determination is made. While we have established reserves based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventualities, these reserves may prove to be insufficient.In addition, our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated, or by the incurrence of losses, in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, as a result of gains on our foreign currency exchange risk management program; or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items.Various levels of government, such as U.S. federal and state legislatures, and international organizations, such as the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) and the EU, are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative or regulatory action to increase tax revenue. Various countries, most notably in the EU, have proposed or enacted digital services taxes. Any such tax reform or other legislative or regulatory actions could increase our effective tax rate. 30 Table of Contents We and our merchants may be subject to sales reporting and record-keeping obligations. A number of U.S. states, the U.S. federal government, and foreign countries have implemented or are in the process of implementing reporting or record-keeping obligations on companies that engage in or facilitate e-commerce to improve tax compliance. Additionally, a number of jurisdictions are reviewing whether payment service providers and other intermediaries could be deemed to be the legal agent of merchants for certain tax purposes. We have modified our systems to meet applicable requirements and expect that further modifications will be required to comply with future requirements, which may negatively impact our customer experience and increase operational costs. Any failure by us to comply with these and similar reporting and record-keeping obligations could result in substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions, adversely impact our ability to do business in certain jurisdictions, and harm our business. Acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic investments, and other strategic transactions could result in operating difficulties and could harm our business. Acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic investments, and other strategic transactions are important elements of our overall corporate strategy. We expect to continue to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions as part of our overall business strategy, including business combinations, acquisitions, and dispositions of certain businesses, technologies, services, products, and other assets, as well as joint ventures, strategic investments, and commercial and strategic partnerships. These transactions may involve significant challenges, uncertainties, and risks, including:•the potential loss of key customers, vendors, and other key business partners of the companies we acquire, or dispose of, following and continuing after announcement of our transaction plans;•difficulty making strategic hires of new employees, declining employee morale, and retention issues affecting employees (particularly the potential loss of key personnel) of companies that we acquire or dispose of, which may result from changes in compensation, management, reporting relationships, future prospects, or the direction of the acquired or disposed business;•differences between our culture and values and those of our acquired companies;•diversion of management time and focus;•the need to and difficulty of integrating the operations, systems (including accounting, compliance, management, information, human resource, and other administrative systems), technologies, data assets, products, and personnel of each acquired company, which is an inherently risky and potentially lengthy and costly process;•the need to and difficulty of implementing and/or enhancing controls, procedures, and policies appropriate for a larger public company at acquired companies which, prior to the acquisition, may have lacked such controls, procedures, and policies or whose controls, procedures, and policies did not meet applicable legal and regulatory standards;•the inefficiencies and lack of control that may result if integration of acquired companies is delayed or not implemented, and unforeseen difficulties and costs that may arise as a result;•potential exposure to new or increased regulatory oversight and uncertain or evolving legal, regulatory, and compliance requirements associated with new products and services or entry into new markets, including transactions with, or investments in, companies involved in new or developing businesses or industries;•potential reputational risks that could arise from transactions with, or investments in, companies involved in new or developing businesses or industries, which may be subject to uncertain or evolving legal, regulatory, and compliance requirements;•risks associated with our expansion into new international markets, and challenges caused by integrating operations across geographies, and different languages, cultures and political environments;•unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence process, including, but not limited to, product or service quality issues, intellectual property issues, and legal contingencies;•risks associated with the complexity of entering into and effectively managing joint ventures, strategic investments, and other strategic partnerships;•risks associated with undetected cyberattacks or security breaches at companies that we acquire or with which we may combine or partner;•lawsuits or regulatory actions resulting from the transaction;•liability for activities or conduct of an acquired company before the acquisition, including legal and regulatory claims or disputes, violations of laws and regulations, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities;•the need to maintain, and comply with the requirements of licenses for certain companies that we have acquired, and risks associated with any failure to maintain such licenses or comply with associated requirements;•the acquisition of new customer and employee personal data, which in and of itself may require regulatory approval and/or additional controls, policies, and procedures, and subject us to additional exposure and additional complexity and costs of compliance; •potential financial and credit risks associated with acquired customers, vendors, and partners; and•our dependence on the accounting, financial reporting, operating metrics and similar systems, controls and processes of acquired businesses, and the risk that errors or irregularities in those systems, controls, and processes will lead to errors in our financial statements or make it more difficult to manage the acquired business.At any given time, we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more strategic transactions, any of which could, individually or in the aggregate, be material to our financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying, negotiating, and consummating favorable transaction opportunities. It may take us longer than expected to fully realize the anticipated benefits and synergies of these transactions, and those benefits and synergies may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Because acquisitions are inherently risky, our transactions may not be successful and may, in some cases, harm our operating results or financial condition. Any acquisitions, dispositions, or investments may also require us to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt (and increased interest expense), recognize liabilities, and record gains or losses (realized or unrealized) and amortization expenses related to intangible assets or write-offs of goodwill or intangibles, which could dilute the economic and voting rights of our stockholders and adversely affect our results of operations and the interests of holders of our indebtedness, as applicable.Joint ventures and strategic investments in which we have a minority ownership stake inherently involve a lesser degree of influence over business operations, thereby potentially increasing the financial, legal, operational, and/or compliance risks associated with the joint venture or strategic investment. In addition, we may be dependent on joint venture partners, controlling shareholders, management, or other persons or entities who control them and who may have business interests, strategies, or goals that are inconsistent with ours. Business decisions or other actions or omissions of the joint venture partners, controlling shareholders, management, or other persons or entities who control joint ventures or companies in which we invest may adversely affect the value of our investment, result in litigation or regulatory action against us, and otherwise damage our reputation and brand. 31 Table of Contents There are risks associated with our indebtedness. We have incurred indebtedness, and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness we incur may have significant consequences, including, without limitation, the following:•our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations and generate sufficient cash flows to service such debt. We may be required to use a significant portion of our cash flow from operations and other available cash to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of cash available for other purposes, including capital expenditures, acquisitions, and strategic investments;•our indebtedness and leverage may increase our vulnerability to downturns in our business, to competitive pressures, and to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions;•our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, or other general corporate and other purposes may be limited; and•our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry may be limited.Our revolving credit facilities and the indenture for our senior unsecured notes pursuant to which certain of our outstanding debt securities were issued contain financial and other covenants that restrict or could restrict, among other things, our business and operations. If we fail to pay amounts due under a debt instrument or breach any of its covenants, the lenders would typically have the right to demand immediate repayment of all borrowings thereunder (subject in certain cases to a grace or cure period). Moreover, any such acceleration and required repayment of, or default in respect of, our indebtedness could, in turn, constitute an event of default under other debt instruments, thereby resulting in the acceleration and required repayment of our indebtedness. Any of these events could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.In addition, changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity securities and increase our borrowing costs. If our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, the interest rates payable by us under our indebtedness may increase. In addition, any downgrades to our credit ratings may affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and the terms of any such financing. Any of these factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk. We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, including the following:•networks, banks, payment processors, and payment gateways that link us to the payment card and bank clearing networks to process transactions;•unaffiliated third-party lenders to originate the U.S. PayPal Credit, PayPal-branded credit card, PayPal Working Capital, and PayPal Business Loan products;•third parties that provide loan servicing and customer statements processing;•third parties that provide certain outsourced customer support and product development functions, which are critical to our operations; and•third parties that provide facilities, infrastructure, components, and services, including data center facilities and cloud computing.Because we rely on third parties to provide certain of our services and to facilitate certain of our business activities, we face increased operational risk. These third parties may be subject to financial, legal, regulatory, and labor issues, cybersecurity incidents, privacy breaches, service terminations, disruptions or interruptions, or other problems, which may impose additional costs or requirements on us or prevent these third parties from providing services to us or our customers on our behalf, which could harm our business. In addition, these third parties may breach their agreements with us, disagree with our interpretation of contract terms or applicable laws and regulations, refuse to continue or renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms or at all, fail or refuse to process transactions or provide other services adequately, take actions that degrade the functionality of our services, impose additional costs or requirements on us or our customers, or give preferential treatment to competitive services. There can be no assurance that third parties who provide services directly to us or our customers on our behalf will continue to do so on acceptable terms, or at all. If any third parties do not adequately or appropriately provide their services or perform their responsibilities to us or our customers on our behalf, we may be unable to procure alternatives from other third parties in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all, and we may be subject to business disruptions, losses or costs to remediate any of the deficiencies, customer dissatisfaction, reputational damage, legal or regulatory proceedings, or other adverse consequences which could harm our business. 32 Table of Contents Our point of sale solutions expose us to additional risks. We have several point of sale solutions, which enable merchants to accept payments using a payments card reader attached to, or otherwise communicating with, a mobile device or to scan payment cards and codes using the mobile device’s embedded camera, and which enable consumers to use their mobile devices to pay at the point of sale. We have entered into strategic partnerships with major payment card networks to further expand our relationship in a way that will make it easier for merchants to accept and consumers to choose to pay for transactions utilizing credit and debit cards via PayPal at the point of sale. Those agreements provide us with access to each of these partner's tokenization services in the U.S. for in-store point-of-sale PayPal transactions, which we expect will increase the number of point of sale transactions that we process. We believe that the addition of the iZettle point of sale solutions to our product portfolio will enable us to further expand our in-store presence. As we continue to expand our product and service offerings at the point of sale, we will face additional risks, including:•increased expectations from merchants regarding the reliability and availability of our systems and services and correspondingly lower amounts of downtime, which we may not be able to meet;•increased expectations from merchants that our systems and services will help them to comply with laws and regulations relating to tax, accounting, and bookkeeping, such as cash register systems, which we may not be able to meet;•significant competition at the point of sale, particularly from established payment card providers, many of which have substantially greater resources than we do, and from other competing sale channels (such as e-commerce);•increased targeting by fraudsters; given that our fraud models are less developed in this area, we may experience increases in fraud and associated transaction losses as we adjust to potential fraudulent activity at the point of sale;•exposure to product liability claims to the extent that hardware devices (e.g., card readers) that we produce for use at the point of sale malfunction or are not in compliance with laws, which could result in substantial liability and require product recalls or other actions;•constraints in key resources to develop and maintain point of sale software and ancillary hardware;•exposure to additional laws, rules, and regulations;•increased reliance on third parties involved with processing in-store payments, including independent software providers, electronic point of sale providers, hardware providers (such as card reader, cash drawer, and pin-pad providers), payment processors, and banks that enable in-store transactions; and•lower operating income than our other payment solutions.Unless we are able to successfully manage these risks, including driving adoption of, and significant volume through, our point of sale solutions over time, our business may be harmed. 33 Table of Contents Our success largely depends on key personnel. Because competition for our key employees is intense, we may not be able to attract, retain, and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our business. The loss of key personnel could harm our ability to maintain and grow our business. Our future success and performance are significantly dependent upon the continued services of key personnel, including our executive team and other highly skilled employees, and our ability to attract, retain, and motivate such personnel. Competition for key personnel is intense, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area, where our corporate headquarters are located and where the cost of living is high, and we may be unable to successfully attract, integrate, or retain sufficiently qualified key personnel. In making employment decisions, particularly in the technology and payments industries, job candidates often consider the value of the equity awards they would receive in connection with their employment, and our stock price volatility, or a perception that the market price of our stock may not increase or may increase more slowly than stock prices at other technology or payments companies, may make it more difficult to attract, retain, and motivate employees. We may be limited in our ability to recruit or hire internationally, including due to restrictive laws or policies on immigration, travel, or availability of visas for skilled workers. In addition, we do not have long-term employment agreements with any of our key personnel and do not maintain any “key person” life insurance policies. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel, or our inability to attract or retain highly qualified key personnel effectively, could harm our business and growth prospects. We are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our products and services. Companies providing online services may be subject to claims relating to information disseminated through them, including claims alleging defamation, libel, harassment, hate speech, breach of contract, invasion of privacy, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through the services, among other things. The laws relating to the liability of companies providing online services for information disseminated through their services are subject to frequent challenges. We are also subject to potential liability to third parties for the customer-provided content on our products and services, particularly in jurisdictions outside the U.S. where the applicable laws are unsettled. If we become liable for information provided by our customers and carried on our products and services, we could be directly harmed and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability, including expending substantial resources or discontinuing certain product or service offerings, which could harm our business. Risks Related to Our Separation from eBay If the distribution, together with certain related transactions, does not qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), eBay, PayPal and eBay stockholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities. On July 17, 2015, we became an independent publicly traded company through the pro rata distribution by eBay Inc. of 100% of our outstanding common stock to eBay’s stockholders (which we sometimes refer to as the “separation” or the “distribution”). eBay received an opinion from its outside legal counsel regarding the qualification of the distribution, together with certain related transactions, as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code. The opinion was based on and relied on, among other things, certain facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements, and undertakings of eBay and of us, including those relating to the past and future conduct of eBay and of us. If any of these representations, statements, or undertakings were, or became, inaccurate or incomplete, or if eBay or we breach any of our respective covenants in the separation documents, the opinion of counsel may be invalid, and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized.Notwithstanding the opinion of counsel, the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) could determine that the distribution, together with certain related transactions, should be treated as a taxable transaction if the IRS determines that any of these representations, assumptions, or undertakings upon which such opinion was based are incorrect or have been violated or if the IRS disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel. An opinion of counsel is not binding on the IRS or any court and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge the conclusions reached in the opinion. The IRS did not provide any opinion in advance of the separation that our proposed transaction is tax-free.If the distribution, together with certain related transactions, failed to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code, in general, eBay would recognize taxable gain as if it had sold the PayPal common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value, eBay stockholders who received PayPal common stock in the distribution may be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares, and we could incur significant liabilities. 34 Table of Contents There are risks associated with our relationship with eBay. In connection with our separation from eBay, we entered into a separation and distribution agreement with eBay, as well as various other agreements, including an operating agreement, a tax matters agreement, an employee matters agreement, an intellectual property matters agreement, a data sharing addendum, and a product development agreement. The separation agreement, the tax matters agreement, the employee matters agreement, and the intellectual property matters agreement determined the allocation of assets and liabilities (including by means of licensing) between the companies following the separation for those respective areas and include associated indemnification obligations. The operating agreement, the data sharing addendum, and the product development agreement establish certain commercial relationships between eBay and us related to payment processing, credit, and data sharing. If either we or eBay are unable to satisfy our performance, payment, or indemnification obligations under these agreements, we could incur operational difficulties or losses or be required to make substantial indemnification or other payments to eBay.Disputes between eBay and us have arisen and others may arise in the future. An adverse outcome in any such matters could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. eBay and PayPal are currently involved in a dispute regarding the calculation and amount of referral services fees due to eBay under the operating agreement. The parties are currently in arbitration proceedings with respect to this dispute pursuant to the dispute resolution provisions in the separation and distribution agreement.Our relationship with eBay is governed, in part, by an operating agreement entered into at separation with a term of five years expiring July 2020 and a one-year tail period. This operating agreement defines a number of important elements of our commercial relationship with eBay, as well as certain obligations and restrictions that limit PayPal’s provision of services to certain competitive platform operators of eBay (as specified in the operating agreement). While eBay remains a significant source of our revenues and operating income, we expect the portion of our revenue and operating income attributable to eBay to continue to decline due to various factors (many of which are beyond our control), including the expiration (or earlier termination) of the operating agreement with eBay, and the speed and extent to which eBay intermediates payments on its platform (including by acting as a merchant of record and migrating eBay merchants to eBay's managed payments platform), limits the availability of PayPal as a payment option or offers (or promotes) alternative payment options, directs transactions on its platforms to different providers of payment services, or eliminates or modifies its risk management or customer protection programs on its platforms, which could result in customer dissatisfaction, reduction in eBay volume, and other consequences adverse to our business. If we are unable to generate sufficient business from our non-eBay customers to offset the expected reduction in the portion of our business attributable to eBay, it could materially impact the growth in our business and our ability to meet our long-term financial targets. Risks Related to Our Common Stock The price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly. The price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including, but not limited to:•actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;•changes in financial estimates by us or securities analysts and recommendations or lack of coverage and reports by securities analysts;•changes in our capital structure;•the activities of our competitors; •speculation, coverage, or sentiment in the media or the investment community;•the operating and stock price performance and valuation of comparable companies;•our quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in our industry;•the public's reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements, and our filings with the SEC;•additions or departures of key personnel; •announcements related to litigation, regulation, or disputes;•changes to the regulatory and legal environment under which we operate; and•market conditions or trends in the payments industry, the industries of merchants, and the domestic and worldwide economy as a whole.As a result of these and other factors, investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above the price at which they purchase our common stock. In addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies like us. These broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In addition, in the past, some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have been subject to class action or derivative lawsuits. The filing of a lawsuit against us, regardless of the outcome, could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, as it could result in substantial legal costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources. 35 Table of Contents Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the state courts of the State of Delaware, or, if no state court located in the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the District of Delaware, as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could discourage lawsuits against us and our directors and officers. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that unless the corporation otherwise determines, the state courts of the State of Delaware, or, if no state court located in the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the District of Delaware, will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors or officers to us or our stockholders, any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“DGCL”) or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes with us or our directors or officers, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors and officers. Alternatively, if a court outside of Delaware were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above, we could incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may prevent or delay an acquisition of our company, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock. Certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of deterring coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and by encouraging prospective acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others:•rules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings;•the fact that directors may not be elected, removed, or replaced at stockholder-requested special meetings unless a person, entity, or group owns at least a majority of our outstanding common stock;•the right of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock and to determine the voting, dividend, and other rights of preferred stock without stockholder approval;•the ability of our directors, and not stockholders, to fill vacancies on our board of directors in most circumstances and to determine the size of our board of directors;•the prohibition on stockholders acting by written consent; and•the absence of cumulative rights in the election of directors.We have also elected not to be governed by Section 203 of the DGCL, which provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that acquire, or are affiliated with a person that acquires, more than 15% of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation, or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the date on which that person or its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15% of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, however, contains a provision that generally mirrors Section 203 of the DGCL, except that it provides for a 20% threshold instead of the 15% provided for by the DGCL. These provisions could delay or prevent a change of control that our stockholders may favor.While these provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers, they will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and may delay or prevent an acquisition that our Board of Directors determines is not in the best interests of us and our stockholders. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. 36 Table of Contents We own and lease various properties in the U.S. and other countries around the world. We use the properties for executive and administrative offices, data centers, product development offices, and customer services and operations centers.

Business Environment We are a leading technology platform and digital payments company that enables digital and mobile payments on behalf of consumers and merchants worldwide. PayPal is committed to democratizing financial services and empowering people and businesses to join and thrive in the global economy. Our goal is to enable our consumers and merchants to manage and move their money anywhere in the world, anytime, on any platform, and using any device. We also facilitate person-to-person (“P2P”) payments through our PayPal, Venmo, and Xoom products. Our combined payment solutions, including our PayPal, PayPal Credit, Braintree, Venmo, Xoom, and iZettle products, comprise our proprietary Payments Platform.We operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened regulatory focus on all aspects of the payments industry. That focus continues to become even more heightened as regulators on a global basis focus on important issues such as countering terrorist financing, anti-money laundering, privacy, cybersecurity, and consumer protection. Some of the laws and regulations to which we are subject were enacted recently, and the laws and regulations applicable to us, including those enacted prior to the advent of digital and mobile payments, are continuing to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation. New or changing laws and regulations, including the way laws and regulations are interpreted and implemented, as well as increased penalties and enforcement actions related to non-compliance, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Therefore, we monitor these areas closely to design compliant solutions for our customers who depend on us.Information security risks for global payments and technology companies like us have significantly increased in recent years. We are not immune to these risks and there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. For additional information regarding our information security risks, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to our reputation, business, and financial condition.”The United Kingdom (“U.K.”) held a referendum in June 2016 in which a majority of voters approved an exit from the European Union (“EU”), commonly referred to as “Brexit.” The U.K. formally exited the EU on January 31, 2020 and a transition period is in place until December 31, 2020 during which time the U.K. will remain in both the EU customs union and single market and follow EU rules. There is a significant lack of clarity over the terms of the U.K.’s future relationship with the EU after that date. We are currently unable to determine the impact that Brexit will have on our business, as any impact will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, trade, regulatory, and other negotiations. For additional information on how Brexit could affect our business, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—The United Kingdom’s departure from the EU could adversely affect us.” Brexit could adversely affect U.K., regional (including European), and worldwide economic and market conditions, and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign currency exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the British Pound and Euro. We have foreign currency exchange exposure management programs designed to help reduce the impact from foreign currency exchange rate movements. In 2019, 2018, and 2017, net revenues generated from our U.K. operations constituted 11% of total net revenues. In 2019, 2018, and 2017, net revenues generated from the EU (excluding the U.K.) constituted less than 20% of total net revenues. Approximately 37% and 31% of our gross loans and interest receivables as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were generated from our U.K. operations. Approximately 6% and 7% of our gross loans and interest receivables as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were generated from the EU (excluding the U.K.). 40 Table of Contents Overview of Results of Operations The following table provides a summary of our consolidated financial results for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017: Year Ended December 31, Percent Increase/(Decrease) 2019 2018 2017 2019 2018 (In millions, except percentages and per share amounts)Net revenues$17,772 $15,451 $13,094 15 % 18 %Operating expenses15,053 13,257 10,967 14 % 21 %Operating income2,719 2,194 2,127 24 % 3 %Operating margin15% 14% 16% ** **Other income (expense), net279 182 73 53 % 149 %Income tax expense539 319 405 69 % (21)%Effective tax rate18% 13% 18% ** **Net income$2,459 $2,057 $1,795 20 % 15 %Net income per diluted share$2.07 $1.71 $1.47 21 % 16 %Net cash provided by operating activities$4,561 $5,483 $2,531 (17)% 117 % All amounts in tables are rounded to the nearest million, except as otherwise noted. As a result, certain amounts may not recalculate using the rounded amounts provided.** Not MeaningfulNet revenues increased $2.3 billion, or 15%, in 2019 as compared to 2018, driven primarily by growth in TPV (as defined below under “Net Revenues”) of 23%. Net revenues from our acquisitions completed in 2018 contributed approximately one percentage point to the growth rate in 2019. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in interest and fee income due to the sale of our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio to Synchrony Bank (“Synchrony”) in July 2018, which resulted in a negative impact of approximately four percentage points to the net revenues growth rate in 2019.Total operating expenses increased $1.8 billion, or 14%, in 2019 as compared to 2018, due primarily to an increase in transaction expense, and to a lesser extent, technology and development, customer support and operations, and general and administrative expenses, partially offset by a decline in restructuring and other charges. Operating expenses related to our acquisitions completed in 2018 contributed approximately three percentage points to the growth rate in total operating expenses in 2019.Operating income increased $525 million, or 24%, in 2019 as compared to 2018. Acquisitions completed in 2018 had a negative impact of approximately five percentage points to the 2019 growth rate in operating income. Our operating margin was 15% and 14% in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Operating margin in 2019 was positively impacted by a reduction in restructuring and other charges driven primarily by the completion of the sale of our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio in July 2018, subsequent to which we no longer record adjustments to the cost basis of loans and interest receivables held for sale, offset by a negative impact of growth in our transaction expense, which increased 22% in 2019, compared to a 15% increase in net revenues in the same period. Acquisitions completed in 2018 had a negative impact of approximately one percentage point in our operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2019.Net income increased by $402 million, or 20%, in 2019 as compared to 2018, due to an increase in operating income of $525 million and an increase in other income (expense), net of $97 million, driven primarily by net unrealized gains on strategic investments, partially offset by an increase in income tax expense of $220 million. 41 Table of Contents Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange Rates We have significant international operations that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar, and Canadian Dollar, subjecting us to foreign currency exchange risk which may adversely impact our financial results. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar versus the British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar, and Canadian Dollar, as well as other currencies in which we conduct our international operations, impacts the translation of our net revenues and expenses generated in these foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar. In 2019, 2018, and 2017, we generated approximately 47%, 46%, and 46% of our net revenues from customers domiciled outside of the United States, respectively. Because we generate substantial net revenues internationally, we are subject to the risks of doing business outside of the U.S. as discussed under “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business, Results of Operations, and Financial Condition.” We calculate the year-over-year impact of foreign currency movements on our business using prior period foreign currency exchange rates applied to current period transactional currency amounts. While changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported results, we have a foreign currency exchange exposure management program whereby we designate certain foreign currency exchange contracts as cash flow hedges intended to reduce the impact on earnings from foreign currency exchange rate movements. Gains and losses from these foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized as a component of transaction revenues in the same period the forecasted transactions impact earnings. In the years ended December 31, 2019 and , the year-over-year foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar had the following impact on our reported results: 2018 Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 (In millions)(Unfavorable) favorable impact to net revenues (exclusive of hedging impact)$(316) $123Hedging impact238 (23)(Unfavorable) favorable impact to net revenues (78) 100Favorable (unfavorable) impact to operating expense158 (18)Net favorable impact to operating income$80 $82 While we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to help reduce the impact on earnings from foreign currency exchange rate movements, it is impossible to predict or eliminate the total effects of this exposure.We also use a foreign currency exchange contract, designated as a net investment hedge, to reduce the foreign currency risk related to our investment in a foreign subsidiary. Gains and losses associated with this instrument will remain in accumulated other comprehensive income until the foreign subsidiary is sold or substantially liquidated. Additionally, in connection with our services that are paid for in multiple currencies, we generally set our foreign currency exchange rates daily and may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign currency exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the times that we set our foreign currency exchange rates. Given that we also have foreign currency exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries, we have an additional foreign currency exchange exposure management program whereby we use foreign currency exchange contracts to offset the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency exchange gains and losses on our assets and liabilities are recorded in other income (expense), net, and are offset by the gains and losses on the foreign currency exchange contracts. These foreign currency exchange contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. 42 Table of Contents Financial Results Net revenues Our revenues are classified into the following two categories:•Transaction revenues: Net transaction fees charged to merchants and consumers on a transaction basis primarily based on the volume of activity, or Total Payment Volume (“TPV”), completed on our Payments Platform. Growth in TPV is directly impacted by the number of payment transactions that we enable on our Payments Platform. Payment transactions are the total number of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed through our Payments Platform, or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution not including gateway-exclusive transactions. We earn additional fees on transactions where we perform currency conversion, when we enable cross-border transactions (i.e., transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries), to facilitate the instant transfer of funds for our customers from their PayPal or Venmo account to their debit card or bank account, and other miscellaneous fees.•Other value added services: Net revenues derived primarily from revenue earned through partnerships, subscription fees, gateway fees, and other services we provide to our merchants and consumers. We also earn revenues from interest and fees earned primarily on our portfolio of merchant and consumer loans receivable, and interest earned on certain PayPal customer account balances.Our revenues can be significantly impacted by the following:•The mix of merchants, products, and services;•The mix between domestic and cross-border transactions;•The geographic region or country in which a transaction occurs; and•The amount of our loans receivable outstanding with merchants and consumers. Net revenues analysis The components of our net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were as follows: Year Ended December 31, Percent Increase/(Decrease) 2019 2018 2017 2019 2018 (In millions, except percentages)Transaction revenues$16,099 $13,709 $11,501 17 % 19%Other value added services1,673 1,742 1,593 (4)% 9%Net revenues$17,772 $15,451 $13,094 15 % 18% Transaction revenues Transaction revenues increased by $2.4 billion, or 17%, in 2019 compared to 2018, due primarily to growth in TPV, mainly from our PayPal, Braintree, and Venmo products, and growth in the number of payment transactions, both of which resulted primarily from an increase in our active accounts. Fees charged to facilitate instant transfer of funds for our customers contributed approximately two percentage points and acquisitions completed in 2018 contributed approximately one percentage point to the growth rate of transaction revenues in 2019. Net gains from our foreign currency exchange contracts recognized as a component of transaction revenues in 2019 were $238 million, compared to net losses of $23 million in 2018. Refer to “Note 10—Derivative Instruments” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our foreign currency exposure management program. The following table provides a summary of our active accounts, number of payment transactions, TPV, and related metrics: 43 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, Percent Increase/(Decrease) 2019 2018 2017 2019 2018 (In millions, except percentages and payment transactions per active account)Active accounts(1)305 267 229 14% 17%Number of payment transactions(2)12,361 9,871 7,769 25% 27%Payment transactions per active account(3)40.6 36.9 34.0 10% 9%TPV(4)$711,925 $578,419 $456,179 23% 27%Percent of cross-border TPV18% 19% 21% ** ** All amounts in tables are rounded to the nearest million except as otherwise noted. As a result, certain amounts may not recalculate using the rounded amounts provided.(1) Reflects active accounts as of the end of the applicable period. An active account is an account registered directly with PayPal or a platform access partner that has completed a transaction on our Payments Platform, not including gateway-exclusive transactions, within the past 12 months. A platform access partner is a third party whose customers are provided access to PayPal’s Payments Platform through such third party’s login credentials.(2) Number of payment transactions are the total number of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our Payments Platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions.(3) Number of payment transactions per active account reflects the total number of payment transactions within the previous 12 month period, divided by active accounts at the end of the period.(4) TPV is the value of payments, net of reversals, successfully completed on our Payments Platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions. ** Not meaningfulTransaction revenues grew more slowly than both TPV and the number of payment transactions in 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to a higher proportion of P2P transactions (primarily from our Venmo and PayPal products) from which we earn lower fees, and a lower proportion of cross border transactions, partially offset by foreign currency exchange hedging gains. Changes in prices charged to our customers did not significantly impact transaction revenue growth in 2019. Other value added services Net revenues from other value added services decreased by $69 million, or 4%, in 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to lower interest and fee income earned on our consumer loans receivable driven by the sale of our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio in July 2018. The decline was partially offset by an increase in revenue share with Synchrony (discussed below), an increase in interest and fee income earned on our merchant loans and advances receivable, and an increase in interest earned resulting from growth in customer balances. Other value added services revenues included approximately $113 million and $109 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, due to revenue earned from transition servicing activities provided to Synchrony, which ended in the second quarter of 2019. Acquisitions completed in 2018 contributed approximately four percentage points to the growth rate of other value added services revenues in 2019.The total gross consumer and merchant loans receivable balance, including loans and receivable held for sale, as of December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 was $4.2 billion, $2.7 billion, and $7.8 billion, respectively. The year-over-year increase of 56% in 2019 compared to 2018, was driven by an increase in both our merchant loans and international consumer loan portfolios. The year-over-year decrease of 66% in 2018 compared to 2017, was driven by the completion of the sale of U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio.In November 2017, we reached an agreement to sell our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio to Synchrony to free up balance sheet capacity and cash flow for other uses and mitigate balance sheet risk. Following the closing of this transaction in July 2018, Synchrony became the exclusive issuer of the PayPal Credit online consumer financing program in the U.S., and we no longer hold an ownership interest in the receivables generated through the program. Subsequent to the sale, we earn a revenue share on the portfolio of consumer receivables owned by Synchrony, which is recorded in net revenues from other value added services. 44 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Beginning with the first quarter of 2019, we reclassified certain operating expenses within our consolidated statements of income. Prior period amounts were reclassified to conform to this presentation. These changes have no impact on our previously reported consolidated net income for prior periods, including total operating expenses, financial position, or cash flows for any periods presented. For additional information, see “Note 1—Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Growth rates presented below are calculated based upon the reclassified prior period amounts.The following table summarizes our operating expenses and related metrics we use to assess the trends in each: Year Ended December 31, Percent Increase/(Decrease) 2019 2018 2017 2019 2018 (In millions, except percentages)Transaction expense$6,790 $5,581 $4,419 22 % 26%Transaction and loan losses1,380 1,274 1,011 8 % 26%Customer support and operations(1)1,615 1,407 1,265 15 % 11%Sales and marketing(1)1,401 1,314 1,142 7 % 15%Technology and development(1)2,085 1,831 1,740 14 % 5%General and administrative(1)1,711 1,541 1,258 11 % 22%Restructuring and other charges71 309 132 (77)% 134%Total operating expenses$15,053 $13,257 $10,967 14 % 21%Transaction expense rate(2)0.95% 0.96% 0.97% Transaction and loan loss rate(3)0.19% 0.22% 0.22% (1) Prior period amounts have been revised to reflect the classification changes discussed above. (2) Transaction expense rate is calculated by dividing transaction expense by TPV. (3) Transaction and loan loss rate is calculated by dividing transaction and loan losses by TPV. Transaction expense Transaction expense is primarily composed of the costs we incur to accept a customer’s funding source of payment. These costs include fees paid to payment processors and other financial institutions to draw funds from a customer’s credit or debit card, bank account, or other funding source they have stored in their digital wallet. Transaction expense also includes fees paid to disbursement partners to enable a transaction. We refer to the allocation of funding sources used by our consumers as our “funding mix.” The cost of funding a transaction with a credit or debit card is generally higher than the cost of funding a transaction from a bank or through internal sources such as a PayPal account balance, a Venmo account balance, or PayPal Credit. As we expand the availability and presentation of alternative funding sources to our customers, our funding mix may change, which could increase or decrease our transaction expense rate. The cost of funding a transaction is also impacted by the geographic region or country in which a transaction occurs because we generally pay lower rates for transactions funded with credit cards outside the U.S. than in the U.S. Our transaction expense rate is impacted by changes in product mix, regional mix, funding mix, and assessments charged by payment processors and other financial institutions when we draw funds from a customer’s credit or debit card, bank account, or other funding sources. Transaction expense increased by $1.2 billion, or 22%, in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily attributable to an increase in TPV of 23%. Acquisitions completed in 2018 contributed approximately one percentage point to the growth rate of transaction expense in 2019. The decrease in transaction expense rate in 2019 compared to 2018 was due primarily to changes in product mix. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, approximately 2% of TPV was funded with PayPal Credit. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, approximately 41%, 43%, and 43% of TPV, respectively, was generated outside of the U.S. Transaction and loan losses Transaction losses include the expense associated with our buyer and seller protection programs, fraud, and chargebacks. Loan losses include the losses associated with our merchant and consumer loans receivable portfolio, except loans and interest receivable, held for sale. Our transaction and loan losses fluctuate depending on many factors, including TPV, macroeconomic conditions, changes to our customer protection programs, the impact of regulatory changes, and the credit quality of loans receivable arising from transactions funded with our credit products for consumers and loans and advances to merchants. The components of our transaction and loan losses for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 were as follows: 45 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, Percent Increase/(Decrease) 2019 2018 2017 2019 2018 (In millions, except percentages)Transaction losses$1,092 $1,059 $823 3% 29%Loan losses288 215 188 34% 14%Transaction and loan losses$1,380 $1,274 $1,011 8% 26%Transaction loss rate(1)0.15% 0.18% 0.18% (1) Transaction loss rate is calculated by dividing transaction losses by TPV. Transaction and loan losses increased by $106 million, or 8%, in 2019 compared to 2018. Transaction losses increased by $33 million, or 3%, in 2019 compared to 2018, due to growth in TPV, partially offset by benefits realized through improvements in risk management capabilities, which also contributed to a decrease in our transaction loss rate over the same period. Loan losses increased by $73 million, or 34%, in 2019 compared to 2018, due primarily to growth in our merchant loans and advances and international consumer loans receivable balances, partially offset by the recognition of losses in 2018 associated with U.S. consumer credit receivable balances that were not subject to the sale agreement with Synchrony. Acquisitions completed in 2018 contributed approximately three percentage points to the growth rate of loan losses for 2019.The consumer loans receivable balance as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $1.3 billion and $704 million, respectively. The year-over-year increase of 88% in 2019 compared to 2018 was due to growth in international markets. Approximately 94% and 93% of our consumer loans receivables outstanding as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were due from consumers in the U.K. The following table provides information regarding the credit quality of our consumer loans and interest receivable balance: December 31, 2019 2018Percent of consumer loans and interest receivables current93.9% 94.9%Percent of consumer loans and interest receivables > 90 days outstanding(1)2.2% 1.7%Net charge off rate(2)4.1% 3.1% (1) Represents percentage of balances which are 90 days past the billing date to the consumer.(2) Net charge off rate is the annual ratio of net credit losses on consumer loans receivables as a percentage of the average daily amount of consumer loans and interest receivables balance during the year. We offer business financing solutions to certain small and medium-sized merchants. Total merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable outstanding, net of participation interest sold, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $2.8 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. The year-over-year increase of 50% in 2019 compared to 2018 was due to growth in our PayPal Business Loan portfolio and an increase in the availability of our PayPal Working Capital product. Approximately 83% and 10% of our merchant receivables outstanding as of December 31, 2019 were due from merchants in the U.S. and U.K., as compared to 87% and 10% as of December 31, 2018, respectively. The following table provides information regarding the credit quality of our merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable balance: December 31, 2019 2018(1)Merchant loans and advances Percent of merchant receivables within original expected or contractual repayment period89.6% 91.0%Percent of merchant receivables > 90 days outstanding after the end of original expected or contractual repayment period4.2% 3.7% (1) Excludes $30 million of loan receivables related to iZettle merchant receivables.Modifications to the acceptable risk parameters of our PayPal credit products for the periods presented did not have a material impact on our loans and interest receivables. For additional information, see “Note 11—Loans and Interest Receivable” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, and “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Some of our credit products expose us to additional risks.” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 46 Table of Contents Customer support and operations Customer support and operations includes (a) costs incurred in our global customer operations centers, including costs to provide call support to our customers, (b) costs to support our trust and security programs protecting our merchants and consumers, and (c) other costs incurred related to the delivery of our products, including payment devices, card production, and customer onboarding and compliance costs.Customer support and operations costs increased $208 million, or 15%, in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase in 2019 was primarily attributable to an increase in employee-related expenses in our operations function that support the growth of our active accounts and payment transactions, and an increase in depreciation and amortization expenses associated with the applications that we use to support our customers and underlying data in our operations centers. Our acquisitions completed in 2018 contributed approximately three percentage points to the growth rate of customer support and operations costs in 2019. Sales and marketing Sales and marketing includes costs incurred for customer acquisition, business development, advertising, and marketing programs. Sales and marketing expenses increased $87 million, or 7%, in 2019 compared to 2018, due primarily to increases in employee-related expenses, amortization of acquired intangibles, and consulting services, partially offset by lower spend on marketing programs. Our acquisitions completed in 2018 contributed approximately eight percentage points to the growth rate of sales and marketing expenses in 2019, primarily due to amortization of acquired intangibles. Technology and development Technology and development includes (a) costs incurred in connection with the development of our Payments Platform, new products, and the improvement of our existing products, including the amortization of software and website development costs incurred in developing our Payments Platform, which are capitalized, and acquired developed technology, and (b) our site operations and other infrastructure costs incurred to support our Payments Platform.Technology and development expenses increased $254 million, or 14%, in 2019 compared to 2018, due primarily to increases in employee-related expenses, and to a lesser extent in data center and cloud computing services utilized in delivering our products, and amortization of acquired intangibles, partially offset by a decline in costs related to contractors and consultants. Our acquisitions completed in 2018 contributed approximately four percentage points to the growth rate of technology and development expenses in 2019. General and administrative General and administrative includes costs incurred to provide support to our business, including legal, human resources, finance, risk, compliance, executive, and other support operations. General and administrative expenses increased $170 million, or 11%, in 2019 compared to 2018, due primarily to increases in employee-related expenses, and to a lesser extent in facilities costs, and depreciation and amortization associated with systems and tools used in our general and administrative functions. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in professional service expenses, including those related to acquisition related transaction expenses incurred in 2018. Our acquisitions completed in 2018 contributed approximately four percentage points to the growth rate of general and administrative expenses in 2019. 47 Table of Contents Restructuring and other charges Restructuring and other charges primarily consist of restructuring expenses and cost adjustments related to our loans and receivables, held for sale portfolio. Restructuring and other charges decreased by $238 million in 2019 compared to 2018, due primarily to the sale of our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio in July 2018, prior to which adjustments to the cost basis of loans and interest receivables held for sale were recorded within restructuring and other charges. This decline was partially offset by an increase in restructuring charges of $53 million in 2019 as compared to 2018. Additionally, in 2019, we recorded a gain of $7 million representing an adjustment to the loss from additional expenses incurred associated with the sale of our U.S. consumer credit portfolio to Synchrony.In the first quarter of 2019 and 2018, management approved strategic reductions of the existing global workforce, which resulted in restructuring charges of $78 million and $25 million, respectively. The approved strategic reductions for 2019 were intended to better align our teams to support key business priorities and also included the transfer of certain operational functions between geographies, as well as the impact of the transition of servicing activities provided to Synchrony, which terminated in the second quarter of 2019. The estimated annual employee-related costs associated with the impacted workforce is approximately $175 million. The majority of the reduction in annual costs associated with the impacted workforce was reinvested in the business. The strategic reduction approved in the first quarter of 2018 included restructuring charges related to the decision to wind down TIO’s operations. We incurred primarily employee and severance benefits expenses under both the 2019 and 2018 strategic reductions, which were substantially completed by the end of 2019 and 2018, respectively. Other income (expense), net Other income (expense), net increased $97 million, or 53%, in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily driven by net unrealized gains on strategic investments due to favorable changes in fair value related to our marketable equity securities and the positive impact of observable price changes related to our non-marketable equity securities, which collectively contributed to incremental net gains of $121 million year over year. This increase was partially offset by incremental interest expense associated with the long term debt issued in the third quarter of 2019. Income tax expense Our effective tax rate was 18% in 2019 and 13% in 2018. The increase in our effective tax rate in 2019 was primarily the result of taxes associated with the intra-group transfer of intellectual property related to the acquisition of iZettle. See “Note 16—Income Taxes” to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on our effective tax rate. Liquidity and Capital Resources We require liquidity and access to capital to fund our global operations, including customer protection programs, our credit products, capital expenditures, investments in our business, potential acquisitions and strategic investments, working capital, and other cash needs. The following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of December 31, 2019 and 2018: Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 (In millions)Cash, cash equivalents, and investments(1)(2)$11,722 $9,710(1) Excludes assets related to funds receivable and customer accounts of $22.5 billion and $20.1 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.(2) Excludes total restricted cash of $64 million and $77 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and strategic investments of $1.8 billion and $293 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 48 Table of Contents Foreign Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments Cash, cash equivalents, and investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were $7.2 billion as of December 31, 2019 and $8.7 billion as of December 31, 2018, or 61% and 89% of our total cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of those respective dates. At December 31, 2019, all of our cash, cash equivalents, and investments held by foreign subsidiaries were subject to U.S. taxation under Subpart F, Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (“GILTI”), or the one-time Transition Tax as further discussed in “Note 16—Income Taxes” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Subsequent repatriations to the U.S. will not be taxable from a U.S. federal tax perspective, but may be subject to state or foreign withholding tax. A significant aspect of our global cash management activities involves meeting our customers’ requirements to access their cash while simultaneously meeting our regulatory financial ratio commitments in various jurisdictions. Our global cash balances are required not only to provide operational liquidity to our businesses, but also to support our global regulatory requirements across our regulated subsidiaries. As such, not all of our cash is available for general corporate purposes. Available Credit and Debt On September 26, 2019, we issued fixed rate notes with varying maturity dates for an aggregate principal amount of $5.0 billion (collectively referred to as the “Notes”). Proceeds from the issuance of these Notes may be used for general corporate purposes, which may include funding the repayment or redemption of outstanding debt, share repurchases, ongoing operations, capital expenditures, and possible acquisitions of businesses, assets, or strategic investments.On September 11, 2019, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) that provides for an unsecured $5.0 billion, five-year revolving credit facility that includes a $150 million letter of credit sub-facility and a $500 million swingline sub-facility, with available borrowings under the revolving credit facility reduced by the amount of any letters of credit and swingline borrowings outstanding from time to time. Additionally, on September 11, 2019, we entered into a 364-day credit agreement (“364-Day Credit Agreement”) that provides for an unsecured $1.0 billion 364-day revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2019, no borrowings were outstanding under the Credit Agreement and the 364-Day Credit Agreement, and as such, $6.0 billion of borrowing capacity was available for the purposes permitted by the Credit Agreement and the 364-Day Credit Agreement, subject to customary conditions to borrowing. Upon our entry into the Credit Agreement, the credit agreement that we entered into in the third quarter of 2015 providing for an unsecured $2.0 billion, five-year revolving credit facility was terminated.In the fourth quarter of 2018, we entered into an amended credit agreement (“Amended Credit Agreement”), which amended and restated in its entirety the previous agreement entered into in 2017. The Amended Credit Agreement provided for an unsecured $5.0 billion, 364-day delayed-draw term loan credit facility, which was available in up to four separate borrowings until April 6, 2019. As of December 31, 2018, $2.0 billion was outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement. On April 5, 2019, the Company drew down an additional $500 million under the Amended Credit Agreement. On September 26, 2019, the Amended Credit Agreement was terminated and we repaid $2.5 billion of borrowings outstanding under that agreement.We also maintain committed and uncommitted credit facilities in various regions throughout the world, with borrowing capacity of approximately $230 million in the aggregate. This available credit, a portion of which is guaranteed by PayPal, includes facilities where we can withdraw and utilize the funds at our discretion for general corporate purposes, capital expenditures, and acquisitions.Interest rate terms for these facilities vary by region and reflect prevailing market rates for companies with strong credit ratings. As of December 31, 2019, substantially all of the borrowing capacity under these credit facilities was available, subject to customary conditions to borrowing.For additional information, see “Note 12—Debt” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have cash pooling arrangements with a financial institution for cash management purposes. Each arrangement allows for cash withdrawals from the financial institution based upon our aggregate operating cash balances held within the financial institution (“Aggregate Cash Deposits”). Each arrangement also allows us to withdraw amounts exceeding the Aggregate Cash Deposits up to an agreed-upon limit. The net balance of the withdrawals and the Aggregate Cash Deposits are used by the financial institution as a basis for calculating our net interest expense or income under each arrangement. As of December 31, 2019, we had a total of $3.5 billion in cash withdrawals offsetting our $3.5 billion in Aggregate Cash Deposits held within the financial institution under the cash pooling arrangements. 49 Table of Contents Liquidity for Credit Portfolio Growth Growth in the portfolio of loan receivables increases our liquidity needs, and any failure to meet those liquidity needs could adversely affect our business. We continue to evaluate partnerships and third party sources of funding for our credit portfolio. In June 2018, the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (the “CSSF”) agreed that PayPal’s management may designate up to 35% of European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary to be used for European and U.S. credit activities. During the year ended December 31, 2019, an additional amount of $500 million was designated by management to fund such credit activities. As of December 31, 2019, the cumulative amount approved by management to be designated for credit activities aggregated to $2.0 billion and represented approximately 31% of European customer balances potentially available for corporate use by us at that date as determined by applying financial regulations maintained by the CSSF. We may periodically seek to designate additional amounts of customer balances, if necessary, based on utilization of the approved funds and anticipated credit funding requirements. Our objective is to expand the availability of our credit products with capital from external sources, although there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving that goal. Under certain exceptional circumstances, corporate liquidity could be called upon to meet our obligations related to our European customer balances. Credit Ratings As of December 31, 2019, we continue to be rated investment grade by Standard and Poor’s Financial Services, LLC and Fitch Ratings, Inc. We expect that these credit rating agencies will continue to monitor our performance, including our capital structure and results of operations. Our goal is to be rated investment grade, but as circumstances change, there are factors that could result in our credit ratings being downgraded or put on a watch list for possible downgrading. If that were to occur, it could increase our borrowing rates, including the interest rate on loans under our credit agreements. Risk of Loss The risk of losses from our buyer and seller protection programs are specific to individual customers, merchants, and transactions, and may also be impacted by regional variations in, and changes or modifications to, the programs, including as a result of changes in regulatory requirements. For the periods presented in these consolidated financial statements included in this report, our transaction loss rates ranged between 0.15% and 0.18% of TPV. Historical loss rates may not be indicative of future results. Stock Repurchases and Acquisitions During the year ended December 31, 2019, we repurchased approximately $1.4 billion of our common stock, including approximately $656 million in the open market and approximately $750 million pursuant to the accelerated share repurchase agreement under our stock repurchase program authorized in April 2017. As of December 31, 2019, a total of approximately $68 million and $10 billion remained available for future repurchases of our common stock under our April 2017 and July 2018 stock repurchase programs, respectively. For additional information, see “Note 14—Stock Repurchase Programs” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In January 2020, we completed our acquisition of Honey Science Corporation (“Honey”) for approximately $3.6 billion in cash and approximately $400 million in restricted stock, subject to vesting conditions. We believe our acquisition of Honey will enhance our value proposition by allowing us to further simplify and personalize shopping experiences for consumers while driving conversion and increasing consumer engagement and sales for merchants. Other Considerations Our liquidity, access to capital, and borrowing costs could be adversely impacted by declines in our credit rating, our financial performance, and global credit market conditions, as well as a broad range of other factors. In addition, our liquidity, access to capital, and borrowing costs could also be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business, Results of Operations, and Financial Condition” and “Note 13—Commitments and Contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion of these and other risks facing our business.We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, cash expected to be generated from operations, and our expected access to capital markets, together with potential external funding through third party sources, will be sufficient to fund our operating activities, anticipated capital expenditures, and our credit products for the foreseeable future. Depending on market conditions, we may from time to time issue debt, including in private or public offerings, to fund our operating activities, finance acquisitions, make strategic investments, repurchase shares under our share repurchase programs, or reduce our cost of capital. 50 Table of Contents Cash Flows The following table summarizes our consolidated statements of cash flows: Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 (In millions)Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities$4,561 $5,483 $2,531Investing activities(5,733) 840 (4,485)Financing activities3,688 (1,262) 4,084Effect of exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash(6) (113) 36Net increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash$2,510 $4,948 $2,166 Operating Activities Cash flows from operating activities includes net income adjusted for certain non-cash expenses, timing differences between expenses recognized for provision for transaction and loan losses and actual cash transaction losses incurred, and changes in other assets and liabilities. Significant non-cash expenses for the period include depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation. The cash impact from actual transaction losses incurred during a period is reflected as a negative impact to changes in other assets and liabilities in cash from operating activities. The expenses recognized during the period for provision for loan losses are estimates of probable incurred losses on our consumer and merchant credit products (excluding the U.S. consumer credit portfolio from and after November 2017). Actual charge-offs of receivables related to our consumer and merchant credit products (excluding the U.S. consumer credit portfolio from and after November 2017) have no impact on cash from operating activities.We generated cash from operating activities of $4.6 billion in 2019 due primarily to operating income of $2.7 billion. During 2019, adjustments for non-cash expenses of stock-based compensation were $1.0 billion, depreciation and amortization were $912 million, and provision for transaction and loan losses were $1.4 billion, partially offset by adjustments related to deferred income taxes of $269 million and net unrealized gains on our strategic investments of $207 million in 2019. The cash generated from operating activities was negatively impacted by the changes in other assets and liabilities of $433 million, primarily related to actual cash transaction losses incurred during the period partially offset by an increase in funds payable and amounts due to customers, and an increase in accounts receivable of $120 million.We generated cash from operating activities of $5.5 billion in 2018 due primarily to operating income of approximately $2.2 billion and the positive impact of $1.4 billion of changes in loans and interest receivable, held for sale, net following the sale of our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio. Adjustments for non-cash expenses of stock-based compensation were $853 million and depreciation and amortization were $776 million during 2018. Adjustments for non-cash expenses related to the provision for transaction and loan losses were approximately $1.3 billion and cost basis adjustments to loans and interest receivable held for sale were $244 million during 2018. The cash generated from operating activities was negatively impacted by changes in other assets and liabilities of $708 million, primarily related to actual cash transaction losses incurred during the period. Cash paid for income taxes, net in 2019, 2018, and 2017 was $665 million, $328 million, and $117 million, respectively. Investing Activities Cash flows from investing activities includes purchases, maturities and sales of investments, cash paid for acquisitions and strategic investments, purchases and sales of property and equipment, changes in principal loans receivable, and funds receivable. The net cash used in investing activities of $5.7 billion in 2019 was due primarily to purchases of investments of $27.9 billion, changes in principal loans receivable, net of $1.6 billion, purchases of property and equipment of $704 million, and changes in funds receivable from customers of $342 million. These cash outflows were partially offset by maturities and sales of investments of $24.9 billion.We generated cash from investing activities of $840 million in 2018 due primarily to maturities and sales of investments of $21.9 billion, changes in principal loans receivable, net of $3.1 billion, and changes in funds receivable from customers of $1.1 billion. These cash inflows were offset by purchases of investments of $22.4 billion, acquisitions of $2.1 billion (net of cash and restricted cash acquired), and purchases of property and equipment of $823 million. 51 Table of Contents Financing Activities Cash flows from financing activities includes proceeds from issuance of common stock, purchases of treasury stock, tax withholdings related to net share settlements of equity awards, borrowings and repayments under financing arrangements, and funds payable and amounts due to customers. We generated cash from financing activities of $3.7 billion in 2019 due primarily to $5.5 billion of cash proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt in the form of fixed rate notes as well as borrowings under our Amended Credit Agreement, and changes in funds payable and amounts due to customers of $2.5 billion. These cash inflows were partially offset by repayment of borrowings under our Amended Credit Agreement of $2.5 billion, the repurchase of $1.4 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, and tax withholdings related to net share settlement of equity awards of $504 million.The net cash used in financing activities of $1.3 billion in 2018 was due primarily to the repurchase of $3.5 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, repayments of borrowing under financing arrangements of $1.1 billion, and tax withholdings related to net share settlement of equity awards of $419 million, partially offset by cash inflows from borrowings under financing arrangements of $2.1 billion and changes in funds payable and amounts due to customers of $1.6 billion. Effect of Exchange Rates on Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash Foreign currency exchange rates had a negative effect on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash during 2019 and 2018 of $6 million and $113 million, respectively. The negative impact in 2018 was due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against certain foreign currencies, primarily the Australian dollar and to a lesser extent, the Euro. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. Future Liquidity and Obligations As of December 31, 2019, approximately $3.1 billion of unused credit was available to PayPal Credit account holders compared to $1.8 billion of unused credit as of December 31, 2018. While this amount represents the total unused credit available, we have not experienced, and do not anticipate, that all our PayPal Credit account holders will access their entire available credit at any given point in time. In addition, the individual lines of credit that make up this unused credit are subject to periodic review and termination based on, among other things, account usage and customer creditworthiness. We have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments for general operating purposes. Changes in our business needs, contractual cancellation provisions, fluctuating interest rates, and other factors may result in actual payments differing from the estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of these payments. The following table summarizes our obligations as of December 31, 2019 that are expected to impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods. We believe we will be able to fund these obligations through our existing cash and investment portfolio and cash expected to be generated from operations. PurchaseObligations OperatingLeases Transition Tax Long-term Debt TotalPayments Due During the Year Ending December 31,(In millions)2020$256 $137 $114 $129 $636202160 138 114 128 440202218 106 114 1,128 1,36620232 88 212 106 40820242 81 284 1,356 1,723Thereafter14 224 354 3,030 3,622 $352 $774 $1,192 $5,877 $8,195 52 Table of Contents The significant assumptions used in our determination of amounts presented in the above table are as follows:•Purchase obligation amounts include minimum purchase commitments for advertising, capital expenditures (computer equipment, software applications, engineering development services, and construction contracts), and other goods and services entered into in the ordinary course of business.•Operating lease amounts include minimum rental payments under our non-cancelable operating leases (including leases not yet commenced) primarily for office and data center facilities. The amounts presented are consistent with contractual terms and are not expected to differ significantly from actual results under our existing leases, unless a substantial change in our headcount needs requires us to expand our occupied space or exit an office facility early.•Transition Tax represents the one-time mandatory tax on previously deferred foreign earnings under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), as further discussed in “Note 16—Income Taxes” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. •Long-term debt amounts represent the future principal and interest payments (based on contractual interest rates) on our fixed-rate debt. For more information, see “Note 12—Debt” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As we are unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits, net, the table above does not include $990 million of such non-current liabilities included in deferred and other tax liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2019. Seasonality The Company does not experience meaningful seasonality with respect to net revenues. No individual quarter in 2019, 2018, or 2017 accounted for more than 30% of annual net revenue. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The application of U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect our reported financial condition. We have established detailed policies and control procedures to provide reasonable assurance that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period. The accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to our financial statements. An accounting estimate is considered critical if both (a) the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (b) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to our financial condition. Senior management has discussed the development, selection, and disclosure of these estimates with the Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors. Our significant accounting policies, including recent accounting pronouncements, are described in “Note 1—Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.A quantitative sensitivity analysis is provided where that information is reasonably available, can be reliably estimated, and provides material information to investors. The amounts used to assess sensitivity are included to allow users of this report to understand a general directional cause and effect of changes in the estimates and do not represent management’s predictions of variability. For all of these estimates, it should be noted that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted, and estimates require regular review and adjustment. Transaction and loan losses Transaction and loan losses include the expense associated with our customer protection programs, fraud, chargebacks, and credit losses associated with our loans receivable balances. Our transaction and loan losses fluctuate depending on many factors, including: total TPV, macroeconomic conditions, changes to our customer protection programs, the impact of regulatory changes, and the credit quality of loans receivable arising from transactions funded with our credit products, which include our PayPal Credit consumer product and merchant loans and advances arising from our PayPal Working Capital (“PPWC”) and PayPal Business Loan (“PPBL”) products.We establish allowances for estimated transaction losses arising from processing customer transactions, such as chargebacks for unauthorized credit card use and merchant-related chargebacks due to non-delivery of goods or services, ACH returns, buyer protection program claims, account takeovers, and account overdrafts. Additions to the allowance, in the form of provisions, are reflected in transaction and loan losses on our consolidated statements of income. The allowances are monitored regularly and are updated based on actual claims data. The allowances are based on known facts and circumstances, internal factors including experience with similar cases, historical trends involving loss payment patterns, and the mix of transaction and loss types.We also establish an allowance for loans receivable, which represents our estimate of probable incurred loan losses inherent in our merchant loans and advances and consumer loans receivable. Increases to the allowance for loans receivable are reflected as transaction and loan losses on our consolidated financial statements. This evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates and judgments. For our consumer loan receivables, consisting primarily of our international consumer receivables, the allowance is primarily based on forecasted principal balance delinquency rates (“roll rates”). Roll rates are the percentage of balances which we estimate will migrate from one stage of delinquency to the next based on our historical experience, as well as external factors such as estimated bankruptcies and levels of unemployment. Roll rates are applied to the principal amount of our consumer loan receivables for each stage of delinquency, from current to 180 days past the payment due date, to estimate the principal loans which have incurred losses and are probable to be charged off. For merchant loans and advances the allowance is primarily based on principal balances, forecasted delinquency rates, and recoveries through the use of a vintage-based loss forecasting model.The allowance for loss against the interest receivable is determined primarily by applying historical average customer account roll rates to the interest receivable balance in each stage of delinquency to project the value of accounts that have incurred losses and are probable to be charged off. The allowance for fees receivable is primarily based on fee balances, forecasted delinquency rates, and recoveries through the use of a vintage-based loss forecasting model. Increases to the allowance for interest receivable are reflected as a reduction of net revenues on our consolidated statements of income. Increases to the allowance for fees receivable are recognized as a reduction in deferred revenues included in other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.Determining appropriate allowances for these losses is an inherently uncertain process and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates. We regularly update our allowance estimates as new facts become known and events occur that may impact the settlement or recovery of losses. The allowances are maintained at a level we deem appropriate to adequately provide for losses incurred at the balance sheet date. Based on our results for the year ended December 31, 2019, an aggregate ten percent increase in our transaction and loan loss rate would negatively impact transaction and loan losses by approximately $138 million. 53 Table of Contents Accounting for Income Taxes Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates, and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective government taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. Our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rates that apply to our foreign earnings. In addition to local country tax laws and regulations, our income tax rate depends on the extent that our foreign earnings are taxed by the U.S. through new provisions under the Tax Act such as the GILTI tax and base erosion anti-abuse tax or as a result of our indefinite reinvestment assertion. Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management’s judgment about, and intentions concerning, our future operations. Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings, and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates that are based on a number of factors, including our historical experience and short-range and long-range business forecasts. To the extent deferred tax assets are not expected to be realized, we record a valuation allowance.We recognize and measure uncertain tax positions in accordance with U.S. GAAP, pursuant to which we only recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. U.S. GAAP further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings in the quarter in which such change occurs. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.We file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions around the world. A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited by the relevant tax authorities and finally resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our reserves for income taxes are adequate such that we reflect the benefits more likely than not to be sustained in an examination. We adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest and penalties, where appropriate in light of changing facts and circumstances. Settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash.Based on our results for the year ended December 31, 2019, a one-percentage point increase in our effective tax rate would have resulted in an increase in our income tax expense of approximately $30 million. 54 Table of Contents Loss Contingencies We are currently involved in various claims, regulatory and legal proceedings, and investigations of potential operating violations by regulatory oversight authorities. We regularly review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim, legal proceeding, or potential regulatory violation is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses, and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims, litigation, or other violations and may revise our estimates. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes. Revenue Recognition Application of the accounting principles in U.S. GAAP related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires us to make judgments and estimates. Complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting. Specifically, the determination of whether we are a principal to a transaction (gross revenue) or an agent (net revenue) can require considerable judgment. Further, we provide incentive payments to consumers and merchants, which require judgment to determine whether the payments should be recorded as a reduction to gross revenue. Changes in judgments with respect to these assumptions and estimates could impact the amount of revenue recognized. Valuation of Goodwill and Intangibles The valuation of assets acquired in a business combination and asset impairment reviews require the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to estimate the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in an acquired business to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized and goodwill. Impairment testing for assets, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, requires the allocation of cash flows to those assets or group of assets and, if required, an estimate of fair value for the assets or group of assets. Our estimates are based upon assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. These valuations require the use of management’s assumptions, which do not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur.We evaluate goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or sooner if indicators of impairment exist. Under U.S. GAAP, the evaluation of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment allows for a qualitative assessment to be performed, which is similar to the U.S. GAAP for evaluating goodwill for impairment. In performing these qualitative assessments, we consider relevant events and conditions, including but not limited to: macroeconomic trends, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance, cost factors, company-specific events, legal and regulatory factors, and our market capitalization. If the qualitative assessments indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than their carrying amounts, we must perform a quantitative impairment test.Under the quantitative impairment test, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds the fair value of the respective reporting unit goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset, an impairment loss is recorded in the statement of income. Measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit is based on one or more of the following fair value measures: amounts at which the unit as a whole could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties, present value techniques of estimated future cash flows, valuation techniques based on multiples of earnings or revenue, or a similar performance measure. 55 Table of Contents Market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity investment risk. Management establishes and oversees the implementation of policies governing our investing, funding, and foreign currency derivative activities in order to mitigate market risks. We monitor risk exposures on an ongoing basis. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to interest rate risk relating to our investment portfolio and from interest-rate sensitive assets underlying the customer balances we hold on our consolidated balance sheets as customer accounts. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, approximately 63% and 78%, respectively, of our total cash, cash equivalents, and investment portfolio (excluding restricted cash and strategic investments) was held in cash and cash equivalents. The assets underlying the customer balances we hold on our consolidated balance sheets as customer accounts are maintained in interest and non-interest bearing bank deposits, time deposits, U.S. and foreign government and agency securities, and corporate debt securities. We seek to preserve principal while holding eligible liquid assets, as defined by applicable regulatory requirements and commercial law in certain jurisdictions where we operate, equal to at least 100% of the aggregate amount of all customer balances. We do not pay interest on amounts due to customers.We have $5.0 billion in fixed rate debt with varying maturity dates. Since these notes bear interest at fixed rates, they do not result in any financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. However, the fair value of these notes fluctuates when interest rates change. We also have various committed credit facilities available to us aggregating to approximately $6.1 billion. We are obligated to pay interest on loans under these facilities as well as other customary fees, including an upfront fee and an unused commitment fee based on our debt rating. Borrowings under these facilities, if any, bear interest at floating rates. As a result, we are exposed to the risk related to fluctuations in interest rate to the extent of our borrowings. As of December 31, 2019, we had no amounts outstanding under these credit facilities. As of December 31, 2018, we had $2.0 billion of borrowings outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 3.34%. For additional information, see “Note 12—Debt” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-KInterest rates may also adversely impact our customers’ spending levels and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amounts owed to us. Higher interest rates often lead to higher payment obligations by customers of our credit products to us, or to lenders under mortgage, credit card, and other consumer and merchant loans, which may reduce our customers’ ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore lead to increased delinquencies, charge-offs, and allowances for loans and interest receivable, which could have an adverse effect on our net income. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would not have had a material impact on our financial assets or liabilities at December 31, 2019 and 2018. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We have significant operations internationally that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar, and Canadian Dollar, subjecting us to foreign currency exchange rate risk, which may adversely impact our financial results. We transact business in various foreign currencies and have significant international revenues and costs. In addition, we charge our international subsidiaries for their use of intellectual property and technology and for certain corporate services. Our cash flows, results of operations, and certain of our intercompany balances that are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses due to foreign currency fluctuations and related hedging activities. We are generally a net receiver of foreign currencies and therefore benefit from a weakening of the U.S. dollar, and are adversely affected by a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, relative to foreign currencies.We have a foreign currency exchange exposure management program designed to identify material foreign currency exposures, manage these exposures, and reduce the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated cash flows and results of operations through the execution of foreign currency exchange contracts. These foreign currency exchange contracts are accounted for as derivative instruments. For additional details related to our foreign currency exchange contracts, please see “Note 10—Derivative Instruments” to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We use foreign currency exchange forward contracts to protect our forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings and our investment in a foreign subsidiary from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These hedging contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse foreign currency exchange rate movements. We designate these contracts as cash flow and net investment hedges for accounting purposes. The derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”). Cash flow hedges are subsequently reclassified into the financial statement line item in which the hedged item is recorded in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The accumulated gains and losses associated with the net investment hedge will remain in AOCI until the foreign subsidiary is sold or substantially liquidated, at which point they will be reclassified into earnings.We considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that changes in exchange rates of 20% for all currencies could be experienced in the near term. If the U.S. dollar weakened by 20% at December 31, 2019 and 2018, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign currency exchange forward contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately $900 million and $707 million lower, respectively. If the U.S. dollar strengthened by 20% at December 31, 2019 and 2018, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign currency exchange forward contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately $900 million and $707 million higher, respectively.We have an additional foreign currency exchange management program whereby we use foreign currency exchange contracts to offset the foreign currency exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency exchange gains and losses on our assets and liabilities are recorded in other income (expense), net, and are offset by the gains and losses on the foreign currency exchange contracts.Adverse changes in exchange rates of 20% for all currencies would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately $147 million and $295 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, without considering the offsetting effect of hedging. Foreign currency exchange contracts in place as of December 31, 2019 would have positively impacted income before income taxes by approximately $153 million, resulting in a net positive impact of approximately $6 million. Foreign currency exchange contracts in place as of December 31, 2018 would have positively impacted income before income taxes by approximately $308 million, resulting in a net positive impact of approximately $13 million. These reasonably possible adverse changes in exchange rates of 20% were applied to total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of our subsidiaries at the balance sheet dates to compute the adverse impact these changes would have had on our income before income taxes in the near term. 56 Table of Contents Equity Investment Risk Our strategic investments are subject to a variety of market-related risks that could substantially reduce or increase the carrying value of the portfolio. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, our strategic investments totaled $1.8 billion and $293 million, respectively, which represented approximately 13% and 3% of our total cash, cash equivalents, and investment portfolio at those respective dates. Our strategic investments include marketable equity securities, which are publicly traded, and non-marketable equity securities, which are investments in privately held companies that are not publicly traded. We are required to record all adjustments to the carrying value of these strategic investments through our consolidated statements of income. As such, we anticipate volatility to our net income in future periods due to changes in fair value related to our investments in marketable equity securities and changes in observable prices related to our non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the Measurement Alternative. These changes could be material based on market conditions. A hypothetical adverse change in the carrying value of our strategic investments of 10%, which could be experienced in the near term, would result in a decrease of approximately $184 million to the carrying value of the portfolio. We review our non-marketable equity investments accounted for under the Measurement Alternative for impairment when events and circumstances indicate a decline in fair value of such assets below carrying value. Our analysis includes a review of recent operating results and trends, recent purchases and sales of securities, and other publicly available data.",

    "context": "Overview PayPal Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in January 2015 and is a leading technology platform and digital payments company that enables digital and mobile payments on behalf of consumers and merchants worldwide. PayPal is committed to democratizing financial services and empowering people and businesses to join and thrive in the global economy. Our goal is to enable our consumers and merchants to manage and move their money anywhere in the world, anytime, on any platform and using any device. Our combined payment solutions, including our PayPal, PayPal Credit, Braintree, Venmo, Xoom and iZettle products, compose our proprietary Payments Platform. PayPal’s service enables our customers to send and receive payments. We operate a two-sided network where both merchants and consumers have PayPal accounts with stored balance functionality. Since PayPal serves as a proprietary payment method that is accepted by merchants, we are more than a connection to third-party payment networks. Our service enables the completion of payments on our Payments Platform on behalf of our customers. We offer our customers the flexibility to use their accounts to purchase and receive payment for goods and services, as well as to transfer and withdraw funds. We enable consumers to exchange funds more safely with merchants using a variety of funding sources, which may include a bank account, a PayPal account balance, a PayPal Credit account, a credit or debit card, or other stored value products such as coupons and gift cards. Our PayPal, Venmo and Xoom products also make it safer and simpler for friends and family to transfer funds to each other. We offer merchants an end-to-end payments solution that provides authorization and settlement capabilities, as well as instant access to funds. We help merchants connect with their customers and manage risk. We enable consumers to engage in cross-border shopping and merchants to extend their global reach while reducing the complexity and friction involved in enabling overseas and cross-border trade. We earn revenues primarily by charging fees for completing payment transactions for our customers and other payment-related services that are typically based on the volume of activity processed on our Payments Platform. Generally, we do not charge consumers to fund or draw from their accounts; however, we generate revenue from consumers on fees charged for foreign currency exchange. We also earn revenue by providing other value added services which comprise revenue earned through partnerships, our PayPal Credit products, subscription fees, gateway services, and other services that we provide to our merchants and consumers. Our gateway services, which include our Payflow Gateway services and Braintree Gateway services, provide the technology that links a merchant’s website to its processing network and merchant account and enables merchants to accept payments online with credit or debit cards. 4 Table of Contents Strategy Our ability to grow revenue is affected by, among other things, consumer spending patterns, merchant and consumer adoption of digital payment methods, the expansion of multiple commerce channels, the growth of mobile devices and merchant and consumer applications on those devices, the growth of consumers globally with internet and mobile access, the pace of transition from cash and checks to digital forms of payment, our share of the digital payments market, and our ability to innovate and bring new products and services that merchants and consumers value. Our strategy to drive growth in our business includes the following:•Growing our core business: through expanding our global capabilities, customer base and scale, increasing our customers' use of our products and services by better addressing their everyday needs related to accessing, managing and moving money, and expanding the adoption of our solutions by new merchants and consumers;•Expanding our value proposition for customers: by focusing on trust and simplicity, providing risk management and insights from our two-sided Payments Platform, and being technology and platform agnostic; •Extending through strategic partnerships: by building new strategic partnerships to provide better experiences for our customers, offering greater choice and flexibility, acquiring new customers, and reinforcing our role in the ecosystem; and•Seeking new areas of growth: organically and through acquisitions in our existing and new international markets around the world and focusing on innovation both in the digital and physical world. Key Performance Metrics We measure the relevance of our products and services to our customers, and therefore the success of our business, through active accounts, payment transactions, and payment volume:Active Accounts: An active account is an account registered directly with PayPal or a platform access partner that has completed a transaction on our Payments Platform, not including gateway-exclusive transactions, within the past 12 months. A platform access partner is a third party whose customers are provided access to PayPal's Payments Platform through such third party's login credentials. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 267 million active accounts across more than 200 markets. A market is a geographic area or political jurisdiction, such as a country, territory, or protectorate, in which we offer some or all of our services. A country, territory, or protectorate is identified by a distinct set of laws and regulations. Number of Payment Transactions: Number of payment transactions is the total number of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our Payments Platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions.Total Payment Volume (“TPV”): TPV is the value of payments, net of reversals, successfully completed on our Payments Platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions. 5 Table of Contents Our Strengths Our business is built on a strong foundation designed to drive growth and differentiate us from our competitors. We believe that our competitive strengths include the following:•Two-sided Platform—our platform connecting merchants and consumers enables PayPal to offer unique end-to-end product experiences while gaining valuable insights into customer behavior through our data. Our platform provides for simple digital and mobile transactions while being both technology and platform agnostic.•Scale—our global scale allows us to drive organic growth. As of December 31, 2018, we had 267 million active accounts, which included 21 million active merchant accounts. In 2018, we processed $578 billion of TPV in more than 200 markets around the world.•Brands—we have built well-recognized and trusted brands. Our marketing efforts play an important role in building brand visibility, usage, and overall preference among customers. •Risk Management—our risk management system and tokenization usage are designed to help keep our customers safe and to help ensure we process legitimate transactions around the world, while identifying and reducing illegal, high-risk, or fraudulent transactions.•Regulatory—we believe that our regulatory licenses, which enable us to operate in markets around the world, are a distinct advantage and support business growth. Technology Our Payments Platform utilizes a combination of proprietary and third-party technologies and services to efficiently and securely facilitate transactions between millions of merchants and consumers worldwide across different channels, markets and networks. Our Payments Platform connects with financial service providers around the world and allows consumers to make purchases using a wide range of payment methods, regardless of where a merchant is located. Consumers who use our Payments Platform can send payments in more than 200 markets across the globe and in more than 100 currencies, withdraw funds to their bank accounts in 56 currencies and hold balances in their PayPal accounts in 25 currencies. A transaction on our Payments Platform can involve multiple participants in addition to us, including a merchant, a consumer, and the consumer’s funding source provider. We have developed intuitive user interfaces, customer tools, and transaction completion database and network applications on our Payments Platform that help our customers utilize our suite of products and services. Our Payments Platform, open application programming interfaces, and developer tools are designed to enable developers to innovate with ease and offer robust applications to our global ecosystem of merchants and consumers, while at the same time maintaining the security of our customers’ financial information. The technology infrastructure supporting our Payments Platform simplifies the storage and processing of large amounts of data and facilitates the deployment and operation of large-scale global products and services. Our technology infrastructure is designed around industry-standard architectures intended to reduce downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences. Our Payments Platform incorporates multiple layers of protection for continuity and system redundancy purposes and to help address cybersecurity challenges. We have a comprehensive cybersecurity program designed to protect our technology infrastructure and Payments Platform against these challenges, including regularly testing our systems to address potential vulnerabilities. We strive to continually improve our technology infrastructure and Payments Platform to enhance the customer experience and to increase efficiency, scalability, and security. 6 Table of Contents Merchant and Consumer Payment Solutions Our combined payment solution capabilities offer our merchants and consumers a broad range of products and services, enabling our merchants to securely and simply receive payments from their customers while allowing our consumers to make seamless transactions across different markets and networks. We partner with our merchants to help grow and expand their businesses by improving sales conversion; providing global reach, offering alternative payment methods; reducing losses through proprietary protection programs, providing fraud prevention and risk management solutions; and leveraging data analytics. We generate revenues from merchants primarily by charging fees for completing their payment transactions and other payment-related services. Merchants can onboard quickly with PayPal and are generally not required to invest in new or specialized hardware. We do not charge merchants setup or recurring fees for our standard service. We offer access to credit products for certain small and medium-sized merchants through our PayPal Working Capital and PayPal Business Loan products, which we collectively refer to as our business financing offerings. Our PayPal Working Capital product allows businesses to borrow a certain percentage of their annual payment volume processed by PayPal for a fixed fee. Our PayPal Business Loan product provides businesses with short-term financing for a fixed fee based on an evaluation of both the applying business as well as the business owner. We believe that our business financing offerings allow us to deepen our engagement with our existing small and medium-sized business merchants and expand services to new merchants by providing access to capital that may not be available effectively or efficiently from traditional banks or other lending providers. PayPal is a popular form of payment for mobile commerce, and our business has grown with the increased adoption of mobile devices. We believe our Braintree products strengthen our position in mobile payments and extend our coverage to a new class of retailers and service providers that offer their services primarily through mobile applications. Through a single Braintree integration, a merchant can begin accepting payments with credit or debit cards, PayPal, PayPal Credit, Google Pay, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, and other payment solutions. We also offer gateway services, including our Payflow Gateway services and Braintree Gateway services, which enable merchants to accept payments online with credit or debit cards. Our gateway services provide the payment gateway technology that links a merchant’s website to its processing network and enable merchants to accept payments online with credit and debit cards. We believe that our recent acquisition of iZettle in September 2018 will enable us to further expand our in-store presence and strengthen our Payments Platform to help small businesses around the world grow and thrive in an omnichannel retail environment. iZettle offers a card acceptance service that enables small businesses to take credit and debit card payments, as well as a software solution to record, manage and analyze sales. iZettle provides in-store capabilities in eleven countries, as well as near-term, in-store expansion opportunities into other existing PayPal markets. We focus on providing affordable consumer products intended to democratize the management and movement of money. We generate revenue from consumers on fees charged for foreign currency exchange and on interest and fees from our PayPal Credit product. We offer our PayPal Credit product to consumers as a potential funding source at checkout. Once a consumer is approved for credit, PayPal Credit is made available as a funding source in his or her account. We believe that our consumer credit products allow us to increase engagement with consumers and merchants on our two-sided network and differentiate ourselves from other payment processors by helping merchants drive incremental sales through products like PayPal Credit. We are responsible for servicing functions related to all of our credit products. In the U.S., credit originating from our PayPal Working Capital and PayPal Business Loan products is currently extended through third-party financial institutions from whom we purchase the related receivables. For our consumer and merchant credit products outside the U.S., we extend credit through certain international PayPal subsidiaries. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we expanded our strategic consumer credit relationship with Synchrony Financial and agreed to sell our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio to Synchrony Bank. Following the closing of this transaction in July 2018, Synchrony Bank became the exclusive issuer of the U.S. PayPal branded consumer credit program and we no longer hold an ownership interest in receivables generated through the program.We offer consumers person-to-person (“P2P”) payment solutions through our PayPal, Venmo and Xoom products. PayPal continues to be a key driver of our total P2P volumes, enabling both domestic and international P2P transfers across our Payments Platform. Our Venmo app in the U.S. is a leading mobile application used to move money between our customers and to make purchases at approved merchants. Xoom is an international money transfer service that enables our customers to send money to, pay bills for, and send prepaid mobile phone reloads to people around the world in a secure, fast, and cost-effective way, using a mobile device or personal computer. P2P is a significant customer acquisition channel that facilitates organic growth by enabling potential PayPal users to establish active accounts with us at the time they make or receive a P2P payment. 7 Table of Contents Protecting Merchants and Consumers Protecting merchants and consumers on our Payments Platform from financial and fraud loss is imperative to successfully competing in the payments industry and sustainably growing our business. Fraudulent activities, such as account takeover, identity theft, and counterparty malicious activities, represent a significant risk to merchants and consumers, as well as their payment partners. We provide merchants and consumers with protection programs on most purchase transactions completed on our Payments Platform, excluding gateway-exclusive transactions or situations where our customer agreements specifically do not provide for protections. We believe that these programs, which protect both merchants and consumers from financial and fraud loss due primarily to fraud and counterparty non-performance, are generally much broader than similar protections provided by other participants in the payments industry. As a result, merchants may incur losses for chargebacks and other claims on certain transactions when using other payments providers that the merchants would not incur if they used our payments services. We also provide consumer protection against losses on qualifying purchases and accept claims for review up to 180 days post-transaction. We believe that this protection is generally consistent with, or better than, that offered by other payments providers. These programs are designed to promote confidence on both the part of consumers (i.e., when using our Payment Platform, they will only be required to pay if they receive their purchased item or service in the condition significantly as described) and merchants (i.e., they will receive payment for the product they deliver to the customer).Our ability to protect both consumers and merchants is based largely on our proprietary, end-to-end Payments Platform and our ability to leverage the data from both sides of transactions on our two-sided network (i.e., from buyers and sellers, and from senders and receivers of payments). We believe mobile devices will continue to play a significant and increasing role in commerce, including by creating the opportunities to make our ecosystem safer. For example, PayPal is able to use location data from mobile devices and growing protection for the mobile operating environment to reduce financial and fraud risk to merchants and consumers. Our ongoing investment in systems and processes, designed to enhance the safety and security of our products, reflects our goal of having PayPal recognized as one of the world’s most trusted payments brands. Competition The global payments industry is highly competitive, rapidly changing, highly innovative, and increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny and oversight. We compete against a wide range of businesses, including those that are larger than we are, have a dominant and secure position, or offer other products and services to consumers and merchants that we do not offer, as well as smaller companies that may be able to respond more quickly in the face of regulatory and technological changes. We compete against all forms of payments, including credit and debit cards; automated clearing house and bank transfers; other online payment services; mobile payments; and offline payment methods, including cash and check.We compete primarily on the basis of the following:•ability to attract, retain, and engage both merchants and consumers with our two-sided platform;•ability to demonstrate to merchants that they may achieve incremental sales by using and offering our services to consumers;•consumer confidence in the safety and security of transactions on our Payments Platform, including the ability for consumers to use our products and services without sharing their financial information with the merchant or any other party they are paying;•simplicity and transparency of our fee structure;•ability to develop products and services across multiple commerce channels, including mobile payments, credit products, and payments at the retail point of sale;•trust in our dispute resolution and buyer and seller protection programs;•customer service experience;•brand recognition and preference;•website, mobile platform and application onboarding, ease-of-use, speed, availability, and dependability;•the technology and payment agnostic nature of our Payments Platform;•system reliability and data security;•ability to assist merchants in complying with payments-related laws and regulations ;•ease and quality of integration into third-party mobile applications and operating systems; and•quality of developer tools, such as our application programming interfaces and software development kits.In addition to the discussion in this section, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” under the caption “We face substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry” for further discussion of the potential impact of competition on our business. 8 Table of Contents Research and Development Total research and development expense was $1.1 billion, $953 million and $834 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Intellectual Property The protection of our intellectual property, including our trademarks (particularly those covering the PayPal name), patents, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, and trade secrets is important to the success of our business. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on applicable laws and regulations in the U.S. and internationally, as well as a variety of administrative procedures. We also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights when offering or procuring products and services. We have routinely entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and non-disclosure agreements with parties with whom we conduct business, to control use, access to, and limit disclosure of our proprietary information.We pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks, and service marks in the U.S. and internationally. Additionally, we have filed patent applications in the U.S. and in international jurisdictions covering certain aspects of our proprietary technology and new innovations. We have registered our core brands as domain names and as trademarks in the U.S. and a large number of other jurisdictions. We also have in place an active program to continue to secure and enforce trademarks and domain names that corresponds to our brands in markets of interest.For additional information regarding some of the risks relating to our intellectual property, including costs of protecting our intellectual property, see the information in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” under the captions “We are subject to patent litigation” and “We may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or third parties may allege that we are infringing their intellectual property rights.” Government Regulation We operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened regulatory focus on all aspects of the payments industry. That focus continues to become even more heightened as regulators on a global basis focus on such important issues as countering terrorist financing, anti-money laundering, privacy, cybersecurity, and consumer protection. Some of the laws and regulations to which we are subject were enacted recently, and the laws and regulations applicable to us, including those enacted prior to the advent of digital and mobile payments, are continuing to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation. New or changing laws and regulations, including how such laws and regulations are interpreted and implemented, as well as increased penalties and enforcement actions related to non-compliance, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Therefore, we monitor these areas closely to design compliant solutions for our customers who depend on us.Government regulation impacts key aspects of our business. We are subject to regulations that affect the payments industry in the markets we operate.Payments Regulation. Various laws and regulations govern the payments industry in the U.S. and internationally. In the U.S., PayPal, Inc. holds licenses to operate as a money transmitter (or its equivalent), which, among other things, subjects PayPal, Inc. to reporting requirements, bonding requirements, limitations on the investment of customer funds, and inspection by state regulatory agencies. Outside the U.S., we provide similar services customized for various countries and foreign jurisdictions through our foreign subsidiaries. The activities of those non-U.S. entities are, or may be, supervised by a financial regulatory authority in the jurisdictions in which they operate. Among other regulatory authorities, the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (the “CSSF”), the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Reserve Bank of India, and the Central Bank of Russia have asserted jurisdiction over some or all of our activities in their respective jurisdictions. This list is not exhaustive, and there are numerous other regulatory agencies that have or may assert jurisdiction over our activities. The laws and regulations applicable to the payments industry in any given jurisdiction are subject to interpretation and change.Banking Agency Supervision. We serve our customers in the European Union (“EU”) through PayPal (Europe) S.à.r.l. et Cie, SCA, a wholly-owned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a bank in Luxembourg by the CSSF. Consequently, we must comply with rules and regulations of the European banking industry, including those related to capitalization, funds management, corporate governance, anti-money laundering, disclosure, reporting, and inspection. We also are, or may be, subject to banking-related regulations in other countries now or in the future related to our role in the financial industry. In addition, based on our relationships with our partner financial institutions, we are, or may be, subject to indirect regulation and examination by these financial institutions’ regulators.Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) has significant authority to regulate consumer financial products in the U.S., including consumer credit, deposit, payment, and similar products. As a large market participant of remittance transfers, the CFPB has direct supervisory authority over our business. The CFPB and other similar regulatory agencies in other jurisdictions may have broad consumer protection mandates that could result in the promulgation and interpretation of rules and regulations that may affect our business.Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing. PayPal is subject to anti-money laundering (“AML”) laws and regulations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, as well as laws designed to prevent the use of the financial systems to facilitate terrorist activities. Our AML program is designed to prevent our payment network from being used to facilitate money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit activities, or to do business in countries or with persons and entities included on designated country or person lists promulgated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls (“OFAC”) and equivalent authorities in other countries. Our AML and sanctions compliance programs, overseen by our AML/Bank Secrecy Act Officer, is composed of policies, procedures and internal controls, and is designed to address these legal and regulatory requirements and assist in managing money laundering and terrorist financing risks.Interchange Fees. Interchange fees associated with four-party payments systems are being reviewed or challenged in various jurisdictions. For example, in the EU, the Multilateral Interchange Fee (“MIF”) Regulation caps credit and debit interchange fees for card payments and provides for business rules to be complied with by any company dealing with card transactions, including PayPal. As a result, the fees that we collect in certain jurisdictions may become the subject of regulatory challenge.Data Protection and Information Security. Aspects of our operations or business are subject to privacy and data protection regulation in the U.S., the EU, Asia Pacific, and elsewhere. For example, the EU adopted a comprehensive General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), which came into effect in May 2018, as supplemented by any national laws (such as in the U.K., the Data Protection Act 2018) and further implemented through binding guidance from the European Data Protection Board,and expanded the scope of the EU data protection law to foreign companies processing personal data of European Economic Area (“EEA”) individuals, imposed a stricter data protection compliance regime, and included new data subject rights (e.g., the right to erasure, commonly known as the “right to be forgotten”). In the U.S., we are subject to privacy information safeguarding requirements under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act that require the maintenance of a written, comprehensive information security program and in Europe, the operations of our Luxembourg bank are subject to confidentiality and information safeguarding requirements under the Luxembourg Banking Act, among other laws. Regulatory authorities around the world are considering numerous legislative and regulatory proposals concerning privacy and data protection that may contain additional privacy and data protection obligations than exist today. In addition, the interpretation and application of these privacy and data protection laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in a state of flux.Anti-Corruption. PayPal is subject to applicable anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar anti-corruption laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Anti-corruption laws generally prohibit offering, promising, giving, accepting, or authorizing others to provide anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to or from a government official or private party in order to influence official action or otherwise gain an unfair business advantage, such as to obtain or retain business. We have implemented policies, procedures, and internal controls that are designed to comply with these laws and regulations.Additional Regulatory Developments. Various regulatory agencies continue to examine a wide variety of issues, including virtual currencies, identity theft, account management guidelines, privacy, disclosure rules, cybersecurity, and marketing that may impact PayPal's business.For an additional discussion on governmental regulation affecting our business, please see the risk factors related to regulation of our payments business and regulation in the areas of consumer privacy, data use, and/or security in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” under the caption “Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition” and “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 9 Table of Contents Seasonality The Company does not experience meaningful seasonality with respect to net revenues. No individual quarter in 2018, 2017 or 2016 accounted for more than 30% of annual net revenue. 10 Table of Contents Employees As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 21,800 people globally, of whom approximately 11,500 were located in the U.S. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. Separation from eBay Inc. PayPal Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in January 2015 for the purpose of owning and operating eBay’s Payments business in connection with the separation and distribution described below. Prior to the contribution of this business to PayPal Holdings, Inc., which occurred prior to the distribution in July 2015, PayPal Holdings, Inc. had no operations. On July 17, 2015 (the “distribution date”), PayPal became an independent publicly traded company through the pro rata distribution by eBay of 100% of the outstanding common stock of PayPal to eBay stockholders (which we refer to as the “separation” or the “distribution”). Each eBay stockholder of record as of the close of business on July 8, 2015 received one share of PayPal common stock for every share of eBay common stock held on the record date. Approximately 1.2 billion shares of PayPal common stock were distributed on July 17, 2015 to eBay stockholders. PayPal’s common stock began “regular way” trading under the ticker symbol “PYPL” on the NASDAQ Stock Market on July 20, 2015. Prior to the separation, eBay transferred substantially all of the assets and liabilities and operations of eBay’s payments business to PayPal, which was completed in June 2015.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The following discussion is divided into three sections. The first section, which begins immediately following this paragraph, discusses some of the risks that may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The second section, captioned “Risks Related to Our Separation from eBay” discusses some of the risks relating to our separation from eBay in July 2015 into an independent publicly traded company. The third section, captioned “Risks Related to Our Common Stock,” discusses some of the risks relating to an investment in our Common Stock. You should carefully review all of these sections in addition to the other information appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, for important information regarding risks and uncertainties that affect us. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. 11 Table of Contents Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business, Results of Operations, and Financial Condition We face substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry. The global payments industry is highly competitive, rapidly changing, highly innovative, and increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny. We compete against a wide range of businesses, including businesses that are larger than we are, have a more dominant and secure position, or offer other products and services to consumers and merchants that we do not offer, as well as smaller companies that may be able to respond more quickly to regulatory and technological changes. Many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Competition may also intensify as businesses enter into business combinations and alliances, and established companies in other segments expand to become competitive with different aspects of our business.We compete primarily on the basis of the following:•ability to attract, retain, and engage both merchants and consumers with our two-sided platform;•ability to demonstrate to merchants that they may achieve incremental sales by using and offering our services to consumers;•consumer confidence in the safety and security of transactions on our Payments Platform, including the ability for consumers to use our products and services without sharing their financial information with the merchant or any other party they are paying;•simplicity and transparency of our fee structure;•ability to develop products and services across multiple commerce channels, including mobile payments, credit products, and payments at the retail point of sale;•trust in our dispute resolution and buyer and seller protection programs;•customer service experience;•brand recognition and preference;•website, mobile platform and application onboarding, ease-of-use, speed, availability, and dependability;•the technology and payment agnostic nature of our Payments Platform;•system reliability and data security;•ability to assist merchants in complying with payments-related laws and regulations ;•ease and quality of integration into third-party mobile applications and operating systems; and•quality of developer tools, such as our application programming interfaces and software development kits.We compete against a wide range of businesses with varying roles in all forms of payments, including:•paper-based transactions (principally cash and checks);•providers of traditional payment methods, particularly credit and debit cards and Automated Clearing House transactions (in particular, well-established banks);•payment networks which facilitate payments for credit card users;•providers of “digital wallets” which offer customers the ability to pay online and/or in-store through a variety of payment methods, including with mobile applications, through contactless payments, and with a variety of payment cards;•providers of mobile payments solutions that use tokenized card data approaches and contactless payments (e.g., near field communication (“NFC”) or host card emulation functionality) to eliminate the need to swipe or insert a card or enter a personal identification number or password;•payment-card processors that offer their services to merchants, including for “card on file” payments where the merchant invites the consumer to select a payment method for their first transaction and to use the same payment method for subsequent transactions;•providers of “person-to-person” payments that facilitate individuals sending money with an email address or mobile phone number;•merchants and merchant associations providing proprietary payment networks to facilitate payments within their own retail network;•money remitters;•providers of card readers for mobile devices and of other point-of-sale and multi-channel technologies; and•providers of virtual currencies and distributed ledger technologies.We often partner with many of these businesses and we consider the ability to continue establishing these partnerships as important to our business. Competition for relationships with these partners is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to establish, grow, or maintain these partner relationships.We also face competition and potential competition from:•service providers that provide online merchants the ability to offer their customers the option of paying for purchases from their bank account or paying on credit;•issuers of stored value products targeted at online payments;•other global online and mobile payment-services providers;•services targeting users of social networks and online gaming, including those offering social commerce and peer-to-peer payments;•payment services enabling banking customers to send and receive payments through their bank account, including through immediate or real-time payments systems;•ecommerce services that provide special offers linked to a specific payment provider; •services that help merchants accept and manage virtual currencies; and•electronic funds transfer services as a method of payment for both online and offline transactions.Some of these competitors have larger customer bases, volume, scale, resources, and market share than we do, which may provide them significant competitive advantages. Some of our competitors may also be subject to less burdensome licensing, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, and other regulatory requirements. They may devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of products and services, and they may offer lower prices or more effectively introduce their own innovative programs, products, and services that adversely impact our growth.If we are not able to differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors, drive value for our customers, or effectively align our resources with our goals and objectives, we may not be able to compete effectively in the market. 12 Table of Contents Substantially all of our net revenues each quarter come primarily from transactions involving payments during that quarter, which may result in significant fluctuations in our operating results that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, as well as the trading price of our common stock. Substantially all of our net revenues each quarter come primarily from transactions involving payments during that quarter. As a result, our operating and financial results have varied on a quarterly basis during our operating history, and may continue to fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including as a result of the risks set forth in this “Risk Factors” section. It is difficult for us to forecast accurately the level or source of our revenues or earnings. In view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful, and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance. Due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting revenues, it is also difficult to forecast expenses as a percentage of net revenues. Quarterly and annual expenses as a percentage of net revenues reflected in our financial statements may be significantly different from historical or projected rates. Our operating results in one or more future quarters may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. The trading price of our common stock may decline significantly as a result of the factors described in this paragraph. Global and regional economic conditions could harm our business. Our operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions. Uncertainty about global and regional economic events and conditions may result in consumers and businesses postponing or lowering spending in response to, among other factors:•tighter credit, •higher unemployment, •consumer debt levels or reduced consumer confidence.•financial market volatility, •fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, •changes and uncertainties related to government fiscal and tax policies, including increased duties, tariffs, or other restrictions,•the inability of the U.S. Congress to enact a budget in a fiscal year, another sequestration, and/or another shutdown of the U.S. government,•government austerity programs, and •other negative financial news or macroeconomic developments.These and other global and regional economic events and conditions, including Brexit, could have a material adverse impact on the demand for our products and services, including a reduction in the volume and size of transactions on our Payments Platform. In addition, any financial turmoil affecting the banking system or financial markets could cause additional consolidation of the financial services industry, significant financial service institution failures, new or incremental tightening in the credit markets, low liquidity, and extreme volatility or distress in the fixed income, credit, currency, and equity markets, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. See also the risk factor captioned, “The United Kingdom's departure from the EU could adversely affect us.” 13 Table of Contents If we cannot keep pace with rapid technological developments to provide new and innovative products and services, the use of our products and services and, consequently, our revenues could decline. Rapid, significant, and disruptive technological changes impact the industries in which we operate, including developments in payment card tokenization, cryptocurrencies, mobile, social commerce (i.e., ecommerce through social networks), authentication, virtual currencies (including distributed ledger and blockchain technologies), and NFC and other proximity payment technology, such as contactless payments. As a result, we expect new services and technologies to continue to emerge and evolve, and we cannot predict the effects of technological changes on our business. In addition to our own initiatives and innovations, we rely in part on third parties, including some of our competitors, for the development of and access to new or evolving technologies. These third parties may restrict or prevent our access to, or utilization of, those technologies, as well as their platforms or products. In addition, we may not be able to accurately predict which technological developments or innovations will become widely adopted and how those technologies may be regulated. We expect that new services and technologies applicable to the industries in which we operate will continue to emerge and may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies we currently use in our products and services. Developing and incorporating new technologies into our products and services may require substantial expenditures, take considerable time, and ultimately may not be successful. In addition, our ability to adopt new products and services and to develop new technologies may be inhibited by industry-wide standards, payments networks, changes to laws and regulations, resistance to change from consumers or merchants, third-party intellectual property rights, or other factors. Our success will depend on our ability to develop and incorporate new technologies and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards; if we are unable to do so in a timely or cost-effective manner, our business could be harmed. Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to our reputation, business, and financial condition. Our business involves the collection, storage, processing, and transmission of customers’ personal data, including financial information and information about how they interact with our Payments Platform. In addition, a significant number of our customers authorize us to bill their payment cards or bank accounts directly for all transaction and other fees charged by us. We have built our reputation on the premise that our Payments Platform offers customers a more secure way to make payments. An increasing number of organizations, including large merchants, businesses, technology companies, and financial institutions, as well as government institutions, have disclosed breaches of their information security systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks, including on their websites, mobile applications, and infrastructure.The techniques used to obtain unauthorized, improper, or illegal access to our systems, our data or customers' data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and have become increasingly complex and sophisticated, may be difficult to detect quickly, and often are not recognized or detected until after they have been launched against a target. We expect that unauthorized parties will continue to attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means, including hacking into our systems or facilities or those of our customers, partners, or vendors, or attempting to fraudulently induce (for example, through spear phishing attacks) our employees, customers, partners, vendors, or other users of our systems into disclosing user names, passwords, payment card information, or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems. Certain efforts may be state-sponsored and supported by significant financial and technological resources, making them even more sophisticated and difficult to detect. Numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats, including advanced and persisting cyberattacks, phishing and social engineering schemes, could compromise the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the data in our systems. We believe that PayPal is a particularly attractive target for such breaches and attacks due to our name and brand recognition and the widespread adoption and use of our products and services. Although we have developed systems and processes designed to protect our data and customer data and to prevent data loss and other security breaches, and expect to continue to expend significant resources to bolster these protections, there can be no assurance that these security measures provide absolute security. Our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyberattacks or security breaches, and third parties may be able to access our customers’ personal or proprietary information and payment card data that are stored on or accessible through those systems. We have experienced from time to time, and may experience in the future, breaches of our security measures due to human error, malfeasance, system errors or vulnerabilities, or other irregularities. Actual or perceived breaches of our security could, among other things:•interrupt our operations, •result in our systems or services being unavailable, •result in improper disclosure of data, •materially harm our reputation and brands, •result in significant regulatory scrutiny and legal and financial exposure, •cause us to incur significant remediation costs, •lead to loss of customer confidence in, or decreased use of, our products and services, •divert the attention of management from the operation of our business, •result in significant compensation or contractual penalties from us to our customers and their business partners as a result of losses to them or claims by them, and •adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, any cyberattacks or data security breaches affecting companies that we acquire or our customers, partners, or vendors (including data center and cloud computing providers) could have similar negative effects. See Note 4—“Business Combinations,” Note 5—“Goodwill and Intangible Assets” and Note 13—“Commitments and Contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements for disclosure relating to the suspension of operations of TIO Networks (“TIO”) (which we acquired in July 2017) as part of an investigation of security vulnerability of the TIO platform. Actual or perceived vulnerabilities or data breaches have led and may lead to claims against us.In addition, under payment card rules and our contracts with our card processors, if there is a breach of payment card information that we store, or that is stored by our direct payment card processing vendors, we could be liable to the payment card issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses. We also expect to expend significant additional resources to protect against security or privacy breaches, and may be required to redress problems caused by breaches. Financial services regulators in various jurisdictions, including the U.S. and the EU, have implemented authentication requirements for banks and payment processors intended to reduce online fraud, which could impose significant costs, require us to change our business practices, make it more difficult for new customers to join PayPal, and reduce the ease of use of our products, which could harm our business. While we maintain insurance policies, they may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches. 14 Table of Contents Systems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our websites, applications, products, or services could harm our business. Our systems and those of our services providers and partners may experience service interruptions or degradation because of hardware and software defects or malfunctions, distributed denial-of-service and other cyberattacks, human error, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, and other natural disasters, power losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist attacks, computer viruses or other malware, or other events. We have experienced from time to time, and may experience in the future, disruptions in our systems due to break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. In addition, as a provider of payments solutions, we are subject to heightened scrutiny by regulators that may require specific business continuity, resiliency and disaster recovery plans, and more rigorous testing of such plans, which may be costly and time-consuming and may divert our resources from other business priorities.We have experienced and expect to continue to experience system failures, denial-of-service attacks, and other events or conditions from time to time that interrupt the availability, or reduce or adversely affect the speed or functionality of our products and services. These events have resulted and likely will result in loss of revenue. A prolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in the availability, speed, or functionality of our products and services could materially harm our business. Frequent or persistent interruptions in our services could cause current or potential customers to believe that our systems are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid or reduce the use of our products and services, and could permanently harm our reputation and brands. Moreover, if any system failure or similar event results in damages to our customers or their business partners, these customers or partners could seek significant compensation or contractual penalties from us for their losses, and those claims, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and costly for us to address, and could have other consequences described in this “Risk Factors” section under the caption “Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to our reputation, business, results of operation, and financial condition.”Our Payments Platform has experienced and may in the future experience intermittent unavailability. The full-time availability and expeditious delivery of our products and services is critical to our goal of gaining widespread acceptance among consumers and merchants for digital payments. We have undertaken certain system upgrades and re-platforming efforts designed to improve our reliability and speed. These efforts are costly and time-consuming, involve significant technical risk and may divert our resources from new features and products, and there can be no guarantee that these efforts will succeed. Because we are a regulated financial institution in certain jurisdictions, frequent or persistent site interruptions could lead to regulatory scrutiny, significant fines and penalties, and mandatory and costly changes to our business practices, and ultimately could cause us to lose existing licenses that we need to operate or prevent or delay us from obtaining additional licenses that may be required for our business.We also rely on facilities, components, and services supplied by third parties, including data center facilities and cloud storage services. If these third parties cease to provide the facilities or services, experience operational interference or disruptions, breach their agreements with us, fail to perform their obligations and meet our expectations, or experience a cybersecurity incident, our operations could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected, which could result in customer dissatisfaction and damage to our reputation and brands, and materially and adversely affect our business. We do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for all losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of systems failures and similar events.In addition, we are continually improving and upgrading our information systems and technologies. Implementation of new systems and technologies is complex, expensive, and time-consuming. If we fail to timely and successfully implement new information systems and technologies, or improvements or upgrades to existing information systems and technologies, or if such systems and technologies do not operate as intended, this could have an adverse impact on our business, internal controls (including internal controls over financial reporting), results of operations, and financial condition. 15 Table of Contents Changes to payment card networks or bank fees, rules, or practices could harm our business. We rely on banks or other payment processors to process transactions and pay fees for their services. From time to time, payment card networks have increased, and may continue to increase in the future, the interchange fees and assessments that they charge for each transaction that accesses their networks. Payment card networks have imposed, and may impose in the future, special fees or assessments for transactions that are executed through a “digital wallet” such as PayPal’s, which could particularly impact us and significantly increase our costs. Our payment card processors may have the right to pass any increases in interchange fees and assessments on to us as well as increase their own fees for processing, which could increase our operating costs and reduce our operating income. We have entered into strategic partnerships with Visa and Mastercard and other credit card networks to further expand our relationships in a way that will make it easier for merchants to accept and consumers to choose to pay with their respective credit and debit cards. During the terms of these agreements, Visa and Mastercard have each agreed to not enact or impose any fees or rules that solely target PayPal. Upon termination of the agreements, PayPal could become subject to special digital wallet fees or other special assessments.In addition, in some jurisdictions, governmental regulations have required payment card networks to reduce interchange fees. Any material change in credit or debit card interchange rates in the U.S. or other markets, including as a result of changes in interchange fee limitations, could adversely affect our competitive position against traditional credit and debit card service providers and our business.We are required to comply with payment card network operating rules, including special operating rules for payment service providers to merchants. We have agreed to reimburse our processors for any fines they are assessed by payment card networks as a result of any rule violations by us or our merchants. We may also be directly liable to the payment card networks for rule violations. The payment card networks set and interpret the card operating rules and have alleged from time to time that various aspects of our business model violate these operating rules. If such allegations are not resolved favorably, they may result in significant fines and penalties or require changes in our business practices that may be costly. The payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or re-interpret existing rules that we or our processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow, or costly to implement. As a result, we could lose our ability to give consumers the option of using payment cards to fund their payments or the choice of currency in which they would like their payment card to be charged. If we are unable to accept payment cards or are limited in our ability to do so, our business would be adversely affected.We and our payment card processors have implemented specific business processes for merchants to comply with payment card network operating rules for providing services to merchants. Any failure to comply with these rules could result in fines. We are also subject to fines from payment card networks if we fail to detect that merchants are engaging in activities that are illegal or that are considered “high risk,” including the sale of certain types of digital content. For “high risk” merchants, we must either prevent such merchants from using PayPal services or register such merchants with the payment card networks and conduct additional monitoring with respect to such merchants. Although the amount of these fines has not been material to date, additional fines in the future could become significant and could result in a termination of our ability to accept payment cards or require changes in our process for registering new customers, which would adversely affect our business. Payment card network rules may also increase the cost of, impose restrictions on, or otherwise negatively impact the development of, our retail point-of-sale solutions, which may negatively impact their deployment and adoption. 16 Table of Contents Failure to deal effectively with fraud, fictitious transactions, bad transactions, and negative customer experiences would increase our loss rate and harm our business, and could severely diminish merchant and consumer confidence in and use of our services. Our operations process a significant volume and dollar value of transactions on a daily basis. In the event that merchants do not fulfill their obligations to consumers or a merchant's goods or services do not match the merchant’s description, we may incur substantial losses as a result of claims from consumers. We seek to recover such losses from the merchant, but may not be able to recover in full if the merchant is unwilling or unable to pay. In addition, in the event of the bankruptcy or other business interruption of a merchant that sells goods or services in advance of the date of their delivery or use (e.g., airline, cruise or concert tickets, custom-made goods, and subscriptions), we could be liable to the buyers of such goods or services, either through our buyer protection program or through chargebacks on payment cards used by customers to fund their payment. While we have established allowances for transaction losses based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such losses incurred as of the reporting date, these reserves may be insufficient.We also incur substantial losses from claims that the consumer did not authorize the purchase, from customer fraud, from erroneous transactions, and as a result of customers who have closed bank accounts or have insufficient funds in their bank accounts to satisfy payments. In addition, if losses incurred by us related to payment card transactions become excessive, they could potentially result in our losing the right to accept payment cards for payment, which would harm our business. We have taken measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud, but these measures need to be continually improved and may not be effective against fraud, particularly new and continually evolving forms of fraud or in connection with new product offerings. If these measures do not succeed, our business could be harmed. We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that could materially and adversely affect our financial results. We have significant operations internationally that are denominated in foreign currencies, including the British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar, and Canadian Dollar, which subject us to foreign currency risk. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar versus the British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar, and Canadian Dollar impacts the translation of our net revenues generated in these foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar. In connection with providing our services in multiple currencies, we may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the times that we set them. Given that we also hold some corporate and customer funds in non-U.S. currencies, our financial results are affected by the remeasurement of these non-U.S. currencies into U.S. dollars. We also have foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. While we regularly enter into transactions to hedge foreign currency risk for portions of our foreign currency translation and balance sheet exposure, it is impossible to predict or eliminate the effects of this exposure. Any factors that reduce cross-border trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business. Cross-border trade (i.e., transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries) is an important source of our revenue and profits. Cross-border transactions generally provide higher revenues and operating income than similar transactions that take place within a single country or market. Cross-border trade also represents our primary (and in some cases, our only) presence in certain important markets.Cross-border trade is subject to, and may be negatively impacted by, foreign exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, the interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions (e.g., the jurisdiction of the merchant and of the consumer) are often extremely complicated in the context of cross-border trade. Changes to or the interpretation and/or application of laws and regulations applicable to cross-border trade could impose additional requirements and restrictions, impose conflicting obligations, and increase the costs associated with cross-border trade. Any factors that increase the costs of cross-border trade for us or our customers or that restrict, delay, or make cross-border trade more difficult or impractical, such as trade policy or higher tariffs, could negatively impact our revenues and profits and harm our business. See also the risk factor captioned, “Global and regional economic conditions could harm our business.” 17 Table of Contents Changes in how consumers fund their PayPal transactions could harm our business. We pay transaction fees when consumers fund payment transactions using credit cards, lower fees when consumers fund payments with debit cards, and nominal fees when consumers fund payment transactions by electronic transfer of funds from bank accounts, or from an existing PayPal account balance or through our PayPal branded consumer credit products. Our financial success is sensitive to changes in the rate at which our consumers fund payments using credit and debit cards (collectively, “payment cards”), which can significantly increase our costs. Although we provide consumers with the opportunity to use their existing PayPal account balance to fund payment transactions, some of our consumers may prefer to use payment cards, especially if these payment cards offer features and benefits that are not provided as part of their PayPal accounts. An increase in the portion of our payment volume funded using payment cards or in fees associated with our funding mix, or other events or developments that make it more difficult or costly for us to fund transactions with lower-cost funding options, could materially and adversely affect our financial performance and significantly harm our business. We have entered into strategic partnerships with major payment card networks and/or issuing banks to promote greater consumer choice and make it easier for merchants to accept and consumers to pay with these partners’ credit and/or debt cards and to allow us to gain access to these partners’ tokenization services for in-store point of sale PayPal transactions. These arrangements may have an uncertain impact on our business. While we anticipate that these and similar strategic partnerships we may enter into in the future will result in an increase in the number of transactions and transaction volume that we process, we also anticipate that a greater percentage of customer transactions will be executed using a payment card, which would likely increase the transaction costs associated with our funding mix, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and profitability. The United Kingdom’s departure from the EU could adversely affect us. The United Kingdom (“U.K.”) held a referendum in June 2016 in which a majority of voters approved an exit from the European Union (“EU”) (commonly referred to as “Brexit”). In March 2017, the U.K. government initiated the exit process under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, which commenced a two-year period expiring on March 29, 2019, after which time the U.K. is expected to leave the EU in the absence of any effective extension to the Article 50 period. Political negotiations are underway; however, there is a significant lack of clarity over the terms of the U.K.'s exit from the EU and the terms of the U.K.'s future relationship with the EU. The U.K.'s financial service regulators are implementing Temporary Permission Regimes that are expected to be put in place by the U.K.'s government to support European Economic Area (“EEA”) financial services firms in continuing to conduct business in the U.K. should the U.K. exit the EU without an agreement. Brexit could adversely affect U.K., regional (including European), and worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the British Pound and Euro, which in turn could adversely affect us or our customers and companies with which we do business, particularly in the U.K. Brexit could lead to greater restrictions on the supply and availability of goods and services between the U.K and the EEA region, with the potential inability of U.K. companies to fulfill orders leading in turn to a risk of increased merchant defaults and buyer protection claims. Brexit could also trigger a general deterioration in credit conditions, a downturn in consumer sentiment and overall negative economic growth. Any of these scenarios could have an adverse effect on our business or our customers. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and increased complexity for financial services firms as national laws and regulations in the U.K. start to diverge from EU laws and regulations. In particular, depending on the terms of Brexit, we may face new regulatory costs and challenges, including the following:•if we are unable to utilize appropriate authorizations and regulator permissions, our EU operations could lose their ability to offer services on a cross-border basis into the U.K. market and for our U.K. based operations to offer services on a cross-border basis in the EEA markets. For example, our ability to work primarily with the Luxembourg regulator as the lead authority for various aspects of our U.K. operations may also be impacted;•we could be required to obtain additional regulatory permissions to operate in the U.K. market, adding costs and potential inconsistency to our business (and, depending on the capacity of the U.K. authorities, the criteria for obtaining permission, and any possible transitional arrangements, there is a risk that our business in the U.K. could be materially affected or disrupted); •we could be required to comply with regulatory requirements in the U.K. that are in addition to, or inconsistent with, the regulatory requirements of the EU, leading to increased complexity and costs for our EU and UK operations; and•our ability to attract and retain the necessary human resources in appropriate locations to support the U.K. business and the EU business of PayPal could be adversely impacted.These and other factors related to Brexit could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 18 Table of Contents Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight. Our failure to comply with extensive, complex, overlapping, and frequently changing rules, regulations, and legal interpretations could materially harm our business. Our business is subject to laws, rules, regulations, policies, and legal interpretations in the markets in which we operate, including, but not limited to, those governing: •banking, •credit, •deposit taking, •cross-border and domestic money transmission, •prepaid access, •foreign exchange, •privacy, •data protection, •cybersecurity, •banking secrecy, •payment services (including payment processing and settlement services), •consumer protection, •economic and trade sanctions, •anti-money laundering, and •counter-terrorist financing. Our success and increased visibility may result in increased regulatory oversight and enforcement and more restrictive rules and regulations that apply to our business.As we expand and localize our international activities, we have become increasingly obligated to comply with the laws of the countries or markets in which we operate. In addition, because our services are accessible worldwide and we facilitate sales of goods and provide services to customers worldwide, one or more jurisdictions may claim that we or our customers are required to comply with their laws. Laws regulating the internet, mobile, and related technologies outside of the U.S. often impose different, more specific, or even conflicting obligations on us, as well as broader liability. For example, certain transactions that may be permissible in a local jurisdiction may be prohibited by regulations of U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) or U.S. anti-money laundering or counter-terrorist financing regulations.Any failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or new laws, regulations, or orders of any governmental authority (including changes to or expansion of the interpretation of those laws, regulations, or orders), including those discussed in this risk factor, may subject us to significant fines, penalties, criminal and civil lawsuits, forfeiture of significant assets, and enforcement actions in one or more jurisdictions, result in additional compliance and licensure requirements, increase regulatory scrutiny of our business, restrict our operations, and force us to change our business practices, make product or operational changes, or delay planned product launches or improvements. Any of the foregoing could, individually or in the aggregate, harm our reputation, damage our brands and business, and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The complexity of U.S. federal and state regulatory and enforcement regimes, coupled with the global scope of our operations and the evolving global regulatory environment, could result in a single event giving rise to a large number of overlapping investigations and legal and regulatory proceedings by multiple government authorities in different jurisdictions. We have implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations. 19 Table of Contents Payments Regulation In the U.S., PayPal, Inc. has obtained licenses to operate as a money transmitter (or its equivalent) in the states where such licenses are required, as well as in the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. These licenses include not only the PayPal branded products and services in these states, but also our Braintree, Venmo, and Xoom products and services. We may also maintain such licenses for certain companies that we have recently acquired, such as Hyperwallet. As a licensed money transmitter, PayPal is subject to restrictions with respect to the investment of customer funds, reporting requirements, bonding requirements, and inspection by state regulatory agencies. Accordingly, if we violate these laws or regulations, we could be subject to liability and/or additional restrictions, forced to cease doing business with residents of certain states, forced to change our business practices, or required to obtain additional licenses or regulatory approvals, which could impose substantial costs.While we currently allow our customers with payment cards to send payments from approximately 200 markets, we allow customers in only approximately half of those markets (including the U.S.) to also receive payments, in some cases with significant restrictions on the manner in which customers can withdraw funds. These limitations may adversely affect our ability to grow our business in these markets. We principally provide our services to customers in the EU through PayPal (Europe) S.a.r.l. et Cie., SCA (“PayPal (Europe)”), our wholly-owned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a credit institution in Luxembourg. Accordingly, PayPal (Europe) is subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if it violates the disclosure, reporting, anti-money laundering, capitalization, fund management, corporate governance, privacy, data protection, information security, banking secrecy, taxation, sanctions, or other requirements imposed on Luxembourg banks. In addition, EU laws and regulations are typically subject to different and potentially inconsistent interpretations by the countries that are members of the EU, which can make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage. Moreover, the countries that are EU members may each have different and potentially inconsistent domestic regulations implementing European Directives, including the EU Payment Services Directive and the E-Money Directive, which could make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage. The Revised Payment Services Directive (“PSD2”) entered into force in January 2016 and is in the process of being implemented into national legislation, with certain requirements effective January 13, 2018. However, a number of EU member states have not yet fully implemented PSD2 into domestic legislation. Luxembourg, which is the home member state of PayPal (Europe), implemented PSD2 on July 28, 2018. The implementation of PSD2 may negatively affect our business. PSD2 seeks to enable new payment models whereby a newly formed category of regulated payment provider would be able to access bank and payment accounts (including PayPal accounts) for the purposes of accessing account information or initiating a payment on behalf of a customer. Such access could subject us to data security and other legal and financial risks and could create new competitive forces and new types of competitors in the European payments market. PSD2 seeks to regulate more online platforms that handle payments for their sellers. PayPal merchants with affected business models which are not licensed, or which do not benefit from exemptions or integrate a compliant marketplaces solution may not be able to offer PayPal products in the future. PSD2 also imposes new standards (coming into force on September 14, 2019) for payment security and strong customer authentication that may make it more difficult and time consuming to carry out a PayPal transaction, which may adversely impact PayPal’s customer value proposition and its European business.If the business activities of PayPal (Europe) exceed certain thresholds, or if the European Central Bank (“ECB”) so determines, PayPal (Europe) may be deemed a significant supervised entity such that some activity of PayPal (Europe) could become directly regulated by the ECB rather than the Luxembourg regulator (the “CSSF”), as its national supervisor, which could subject us to additional requirements and would likely increase compliance costs.In many of the other markets outside the U.S. in which we do business, we serve our customers through PayPal Pte. Ltd., our wholly-owned subsidiary based in Singapore. PayPal Pte. Ltd. is supervised by the Monetary Authority of Singapore and designated as a holder of a stored value facility, but does not hold a remittance license. As a result, PayPal Pte. Ltd. is not able to offer outbound remittance payments (including donations to charities) from Singapore, and can only offer payments for the purchase of goods and services in Singapore. In many of the markets (other than Singapore) served by PayPal Pte. Ltd., it is unclear and uncertain whether our Singapore-based service is subject only to Singapore law or, if it is subject to the application of local laws, whether such local laws would require a payment processor like us to be licensed as a payments service, bank, financial institution, or otherwise. Payment services legislation currently pending in Singapore may change how PayPal Pte. Ltd is regulated and, if such legislation is passed, our compliance and operating costs will likely increase. In certain markets outside the U.S. (e.g., Australia), we provide our services to customers through a local subsidiary subject to local regulatory supervision or oversight, which may be the holder of a local payment license, certification, or other authorization. In such markets, we may be subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if we violate applicable reporting, anti-money laundering, capital requirements, privacy, corporation governance, risk management, or any other applicable requirements. We have been, and expect to continue to be, required to apply for various licenses, certifications, and regulatory approvals in a number of the jurisdictions where we provide our services, including due to changes in applicable laws and regulations or the interpretation of such laws and regulations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to (or decide to) obtain any such licenses, certifications, and approvals. In addition, there are substantial costs and potential product changes involved in maintaining and renewing such licenses, certifications, and approvals, and we could be subject to fines or other enforcement action if we are found to violate disclosure, reporting, anti-money laundering, capitalization, corporate governance, or other requirements of such licenses. These factors could impose substantial additional costs, involve considerable delay to the development or provision of our products or services, require significant and costly operational changes, or prevent us from providing our products or services in a given market.In many countries, it may not be clear whether we are required to be licensed as a payment services provider, bank, financial institution, or otherwise. In such markets, we may rely on local banks to process payments and conduct foreign exchange transactions in local currency. Local regulators may use their power to slow or halt payments to local merchants conducted through local banks or otherwise prohibit or impede us from doing business in a jurisdiction. Such regulatory actions or the need to obtain licenses, certifications, or other regulatory approvals could impose substantial costs, involve considerable delay to the provision or development of our services, require significant and costly operational changes, impose restrictions, limitations, or additional requirements on our business, or prevent us from providing any products or services in a given market. 20 Table of Contents Consumer Protection We are subject to consumer protection laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. In the U.S., we are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations applicable to our activities, including the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (“EFTA”) and Regulation E as implemented by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). These regulations require us to provide advance disclosure of changes to our services, follow specified error resolution procedures, and reimburse consumers for losses from certain transactions not authorized by the consumer, among other requirements. Additionally, technical violations of consumer protection laws could result in the assessment of actual damages or statutory damages or penalties of up to $1,000 in individual cases or up to $500,000 per violation in any class action and treble damages in some instances; we could also be liable for plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees in such cases. We are subject to, and have paid amounts in settlement of, lawsuits containing allegations that our business violated the EFTA and Regulation E or otherwise advance claims for relief relating to our business practices (e.g., that we improperly held consumer funds or otherwise improperly limited consumer accounts).In October 2016, the CFPB issued a final rule on prepaid accounts. The rule’s definition of prepaid account includes certain accounts that are capable of being loaded with funds and whose primary function is to conduct transactions with multiple, unaffiliated merchants, at ATMs and/or for person-to-person transfers, including certain digital wallets. The rule’s requirements include: the disclosure of fees and other information to the consumer prior to the creation of a prepaid account; the extension of Regulation E liability limits and error-resolution requirements to all prepaid accounts; the application of Regulation Z credit card requirements to prepaid accounts with overdraft and credit features; and the submission of prepaid account agreements to the CFPB and their publication to the general public. In April 2017, the CFPB delayed the effective date of the final rule on prepaid accounts to April 1, 2018, and indicated that it would review, among other issues, the linking of credit cards to digital wallets that are capable of storing funds. In June 2017, the CFPB released proposed changes to its final rule, and in January 2018, the CFPB issued its final rule, modifying some aspects of the rule, with an overall effective date of April 1, 2019. We are in the process of implementing certain changes to comply with the final rule. We expect that such implementation will require us to make substantial changes to the design of certain U.S. consumer accounts and their operability, which could lead to customer dissatisfaction, require us to reallocate resources, and increase our costs, which could negatively affect our business. In May 2015, we entered into a Stipulated Final Judgment and Consent Order (“Consent Order”) with the CFPB in which we settled regulatory claims arising from PayPal Credit practices between 2011 and 2015. The Consent Order included obligations on PayPal to pay $15 million in redress to consumers and a $10 million civil monetary penalty, and required PayPal to make various changes to PayPal Credit disclosures and related business practices. We continue to cooperate and engage with the CFPB and work to ensure compliance with the Consent Order, which may result in us incurring additional costs.PayPal (Europe) principally offers its services in EU countries through a “passport” notification process through the Luxembourg regulator to regulators in other EU member states pursuant to EU regulations. Regulators in these countries could notify PayPal (Europe) of local consumer protection laws that apply to its business, in addition to Luxembourg consumer protection law, and could also seek to persuade the Luxembourg regulator to order PayPal (Europe) to conduct its or the PayPal group's activities in the local country directly or through a branch office. These or similar actions by these regulators could increase the cost of, or delay, our plans to expand our business in EU countries. 21 Table of Contents Economic and Trade Sanctions We are required to comply with U.S. economic and trade sanctions administered by OFAC and the Council of the European Union, respectively. We have self-reported to OFAC certain transactions that were inadvertently processed but subsequently identified as possible violations of U.S. economic and trade sanctions. In March 2015, we reached a settlement with OFAC regarding possible violations arising from our sanctions compliance practices between 2009 and 2013, prior to the implementation of our real-time transaction scanning program. Subsequently, we have self-reported additional transactions as possible violations, and we have received new subpoenas from OFAC seeking additional information about certain of these transactions. Such self-reported transactions could result in claims or actions against us, including litigation, injunctions, damage awards, fines or penalties, or require us to change our business practices in a manner that could result in a material loss, require significant management time, result in the diversion of significant operational resources, or otherwise harm our business. Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing We are subject to various anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws and regulations around the world that prohibit, among other things, our involvement in transferring the proceeds of criminal activities. Regulators in the U.S. and other regulators globally continue to increase their scrutiny of compliance with these obligations, which may require us to further revise or expand our compliance program, including the procedures we use to verify the identity of our customers and to monitor international and domestic transactions. Many countries in which we operate also have anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws and regulations, and we have been and will continue to be required to make changes to our compliance program in various jurisdictions in response. Regulators regularly re-examine the transaction volume thresholds at which we must obtain and keep applicable records or verify identities of customers and any change in such thresholds could result in greater costs for compliance. In the EU, the implementation of the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive and the regulation on information accompanying transfer of funds (commonly known as the Revised Wire Transfer Regulation) may make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage, lead to increased friction for customers, and result in a decrease in business. Penalties for non-compliance with the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive could include fines of up to 10% of PayPal (Europe)’s total annual turnover. On April 19, 2018, the European Parliament adopted the European Commission’s proposal for a Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive, containing more stringent provisions in certain areas, which may also increase compliance costs. Privacy and Protection of User Data We are subject to a number of laws, rules, directives, and regulations (which we refer to as “privacy laws”) relating to the collection, use, retention, security, processing, and transfer (which we refer to as “process”) of personally identifiable information about our customers and employees (which we refer to as “personal data”) in the countries where we operate. Our business relies on the processing of data in many jurisdictions and the movement of data across national borders. As a result, much of the personal data that we process, especially financial information, is regulated by multiple privacy laws and, in some cases, the privacy laws of multiple jurisdictions. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between or among us, our subsidiaries, and other parties with which we have commercial relationships.Regulatory scrutiny of privacy, data protection, and the collection, storage, use, and sharing of personal data is increasing around the world. There is uncertainty associated with the legal and regulatory environment relating to privacy and data protection laws, which continue to develop in ways we cannot predict, including with respect to evolving technologies such as cloud computing and blockchain technology. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our privacy policies and communicated to users prior to our collection, use, storage and transfer, and disclosure of their personal data, with applicable industry data protection or security standards, with any applicable regulatory requirements or orders, or with privacy, data protection, information security, or consumer protection-related laws and regulations in one or more jurisdictions could result in proceedings or actions against us by data protection authorities (which we refer to as “supervisory authorities”), governmental entities or others, including class action privacy litigation in certain jurisdictions, would subject us to significant awards, fines, penalties, judgments, and negative publicity arising from any financial or non-financial damages suffered by any individuals. This could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business. Specifically, this would likely require us to change our business practices, and would increase the costs and complexity of compliance. In addition, compliance with inconsistent privacy laws may restrict our ability to provide products and services to our customers.PayPal relies on a variety of compliance methods to transfer personal data of EU citizens to the U.S., including reliance on Binding Corporate Rules (“BCRs”) for internal transfers of certain types of personal data and Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”) as approved by the European Commission for transfers to and from third parties. PayPal must also ensure that third parties processing personal data of PayPal’s EU customers and/or employees outside of the EU have compliant transfer mechanisms. In October 2015, the European Court of Justice invalidated U.S.-EU Safe Harbor framework clauses that were previously relied upon by some PayPal vendors to lawfully transfer personal data of EU citizens to U.S. companies, and PayPal entered into SCCs with those third parties who had previously relied on the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor framework. In July 2016, the U.S. and EU authorities agreed on a replacement for Safe Harbor known as “Privacy Shield.” Both the Privacy Shield framework and SCCs are facing legal challenges in the European justice system. To the extent that the Privacy Shield or SCCs are invalidated, PayPal’s ability to process EU personal data with third parties outside of the EU could be jeopardized.In 2016, the EU adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective in May 2018. The EU data protection regime expands the scope of the EU data protection law to all foreign companies processing personal data of EU residents, imposes a strict data protection compliance regime with severe penalties of up to the greater of 4% of worldwide turnover or €20 million, and includes new rights such as the “portability” of personal data. Although the GDPR applies across the EU without a need for local implementing legislation, each EU member state has the ability to interpret the GDPR opening clauses, which permit region-specific data protection legislation and have the potential to create inconsistencies on a country-by-country basis. Implementation of the GDPR has required us to change our business practices and increased the costs and complexity of compliance.PayPal also faces additional potential challenges from local data protection agencies (“DPAs”). Because PayPal (Europe) is headquartered in Luxembourg and subject to regulation as a bank in that jurisdiction, we have relied on the “one-stop-shop” concept under which Luxembourg has been our lead data protection regulator in the EU. However, a 2015 European Court of Justice ruling (Weltimmo) affecting companies that do business in the EU potentially could make us subject to the local data protection laws or regulatory enforcement activities of the various EU member states in which we have established legal entities and which apply privacy laws that are different than, and may conflict with, Luxembourg privacy laws.In addition, because of the large number of text messages, emails, phone calls, and other communications we send or make to our customers for various business purposes, communication-related privacy laws that provide a specified monetary damage award or fine for each violation could result in particularly significant damage awards or fines. For example, under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”), in the U.S., plaintiffs may seek actual monetary loss or statutory damages of $500 per violation, whichever is greater, and courts may triple the damage award for willful or knowing violations. We have been, and may continue to be subject to lawsuits (including class-action lawsuits) containing allegations that our business violated the TCPA. These lawsuits seek damages (including statutory damages) and injunctive relief, among other remedies. Given the large number of communications we send to our customers, a determination that there have been violations of the TCPA or other communications-based statutes could expose us to significant damage awards that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business. 22 Table of Contents If one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their financial or performance obligations to us or fail, we may incur significant losses. We have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents, and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the U.S. and abroad. As part of our currency hedging activities, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments with various financial institutions. Certain banks and financial institutions are also lenders under our credit facilities. We regularly monitor our exposure to counterparty credit risk, and actively manage this exposure to mitigate the associated risk. Despite these efforts, we may be exposed to the risk of default by, or deteriorating operating results or financial condition or failure of, these counterparty financial institutions. The risk of counterparty default, deterioration, or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets. If one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or to access or recover our assets that are deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty’s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties, we could incur significant losses, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. 23 Table of Contents PayPal is not a bank or licensed lender in the U.S. and relies upon third parties to make loans and provide other products critical to our business, which raises additional risks. As PayPal is neither a chartered financial institution, nor licensed to make loans in any state in the U.S., we rely on third-party chartered financial institutions to provide PayPal branded credit products to our customers in the U.S., including consumer credits products such as PayPal Credit and PayPal branded Mastercard credit cards, and business credit products such as PayPal Working Capital and PayPal Business Loan products. Any termination or interruption in a partner bank’s ability or willingness to lend could interrupt, potentially materially, our ability to offer consumer and business loan products, which could materially and adversely affect our business. In the event of a partner bank’s inability or unwillingness to lend, we may need to reach a similar agreement with another chartered financial institution or obtain our own bank charter or lending licenses. We may be unable to reach a similar agreement with another partner on favorable terms or at all. Obtaining a bank charter or lending licenses would be a costly, time-consuming and uncertain process, and would subject us to additional laws and regulatory requirements, which could be burdensome, increase our costs, and require us to change our business practices. In addition, as a service provider to these bank partners, which are federally supervised U.S. financial institutions, we are subject from time to time to examination by their federal banking regulators.In July 2018, we completed the sale of our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio to Synchrony Bank, for total consideration of $6.9 billion. The purchase price is subject to a post-closing true-up and certain other adjustments under the terms of the purchase agreement. As a part of a separate agreement, PayPal earns a revenue share on the portfolio of consumer receivables owned by Synchrony Bank, which includes both the sold and newly generated receivables and we will not hold an ownership interest in newly generated consumer credit receivables. It may take us longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction, and those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. In addition, our increased reliance on Synchrony Bank subjects us to risks in the nature of those discussed in this “Risk Factors” section under the caption “We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk.” Our ability to receive the benefit of our business finance offerings may be subject to challenge. Business loans under our PayPal Working Capital and PayPal Business Loan products are provided by a state chartered industrial bank under a program agreement with us. We acquire the receivables generated by those loans after they are originated.A case decided in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, Madden v. Midland Funding, LLC (786 F.3d 246 (2d Cir. 2015)), resulted in some uncertainty as to whether non-bank entities purchasing loans originated by a bank may rely on federal preemption of state usury laws, and may create an increased risk of litigation by plaintiffs challenging our ability to collect interest and fees in accordance with the terms of certain loans. Although the decision specifically addressed preemption under the National Bank Act, this decision could support future challenges to federal preemption for other institutions, including FDIC-insured, state chartered industrial banks like the issuing bank of loans under PayPal Working Capital and PayPal Business Loan products. After the Madden decision, there continue to be a number of U.S. state and federal court legal actions challenging the viability of business models where a non-bank entity enters into a relationship with a third-party chartered financial institution for the issuance of credit products. While we believe the manner in which PayPal branded credit products are offered can be distinguished from Madden, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of any potential litigation, and an adverse determination could materially and adversely impact our PayPal Working Capital and PayPal Business Loan products and our business. Some of our credit products expose us to additional risks. We offer our PayPal Credit consumer product and our PayPal Working Capital and PayPal Business Loan products to a wide range of consumers and merchants in various markets, and the financial success of these products depends on the effective management of related risk. The credit decisioning process for the PayPal Credit consumer product in markets outside the U.S. uses proprietary segmentation and credit algorithms and other analytical techniques designed to analyze the credit risk of specific consumers based on, among other factors, their past purchasing and payment history with PayPal as well as their credit scores. Similarly, proprietary risk models and other indicators are applied to assess merchants who wish to use our business finance offerings to help predict their ability to repay. These risk models may not accurately predict the creditworthiness of a consumer or merchant due to factors such as inaccurate assumptions, including assumptions related to the particular consumer or merchant, market conditions, economic environment, or limited transaction history or other data, among other factors. The accuracy of these risk models and the ability to manage credit risk related to our credit products may also be affected by legal or regulatory requirements, competitors’ actions, changes in consumer behavior, changes in the economic environment, and other factors. Our international expansion of our credit product offerings also exposes us to additional risks, including those discussed in the risk factor captioned “Our international operations subject us to increased risks, which could harm our business.”Like other businesses with significant exposure to losses from merchant credit, we face the risk that account holders will default on their payment obligations, creating the risk of potential charge-offs. We face similar risks with respect to U.S. consumer credit losses through the profit sharing relationship with Synchrony Bank. The non-payment rate among account holders may increase due to, among other things, changes to underwriting standards, worsening economic conditions, such as a recession or government austerity programs, increases in prevailing interest rates, and high unemployment rates. Account holders who miss payments often fail to repay their loans, and account holders who file for protection under the bankruptcy laws generally do not repay their loans.We currently purchase receivables related to the PayPal branded merchant credit products in the U.S. If we are unable to fund our purchase of these receivables adequately or in a cost-effective manner, or if we are unable to efficiently manage the cash resources utilized for these purposes, our business could be harmed. 24 Table of Contents Catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business War, terrorism, political events, geopolitical instability, trade barriers and restrictions, public health issues, natural disasters, or other catastrophic events have caused and could cause damage or disruption to the economy and commerce on a global, regional or country-specific basis, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, our customers, and companies with which we do business. Such events could decrease demand for our products and services or make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products and services to our customers. Our corporate headquarters are located in the Silicon Valley, which is a seismically active region in California. Our business operations are subject to interruption by, among others, natural disasters, fire, power shortages, earthquakes, floods, nuclear power plant accidents, and events beyond our control such as other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes and public health issues. A catastrophic event that results in a disruption or failure of our systems or operations could result in significant losses and require substantial recovery time and significant expenditures in order to resume or maintain operations, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Changes to our buyer and seller protection programs could increase our loss rate. Our buyer and seller protection programs protect merchants and consumers from fraudulent transactions, and consumers if they do not receive the item ordered or if the item received is significantly different from its description. In addition, consumers who pay through PayPal may have reimbursement rights from their payment card issuer (usually a bank), which in turn will seek recovery from us. The risk of losses from our buyer and seller protection programs are specific to individual buyers, sellers, and transactions, and may also be impacted by regional variations to these programs, modifications to these programs resulting from changes in regulatory requirements, or changes that we decide to implement, such as expanding the scope of transactions covered by one or more of these programs. Increases in our loss rate, including as a result of changing our buyer and seller protection programs, could harm our business. Our international operations subject us to increased risks, which could harm our business. Our international operations have generated approximately one-half of our net revenues in recent years. There are risks inherent in doing business internationally on both a domestic (i.e., in-country) and cross-border basis, including, but not limited to:•foreign currency and cross-border trade risks discussed earlier in this “Risk Factors” section under the captions “We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates” and “Any factors that reduce cross-border trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business”;•risks related to other government regulation or required compliance with local laws;•local licensing and reporting obligations;•obligations to comply with local regulatory and legal obligations related to privacy, data security, and data localization; •expenses associated with localizing our products and services, including offering customers the ability to transact business in the local currency, and adapting our products and services to local preferences (e.g., payment methods) with which we may have limited or no experience;•trade barriers and changes in trade regulations;•difficulties in developing, staffing, and simultaneously managing a large number of varying foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences;•stringent local labor laws and regulations;•credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;•profit repatriation restrictions, foreign currency exchange restrictions, or extreme fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for a particular currency;•political or social unrest, economic instability, repression, or human rights issues;•geopolitical events, including natural disasters, public health issues, acts of war, and terrorism;•import or export regulations;•compliance with U.S. laws and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, and other local anticorruption laws;•compliance with U.S. and foreign laws designed to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities;•antitrust and competition regulations;•potentially adverse tax developments and consequences;•economic uncertainties relating to sovereign and other debt;•national or regional differences in macroeconomic growth rates;•different, uncertain, overlapping, or more stringent user protection, data protection, privacy, and other laws and regulations; and•increased difficulties in collecting accounts receivable.Violations of the complex foreign and U.S. laws, rules and regulations that apply to our international operations may result in fines, criminal actions, or sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies. These risks are inherent in our international operations and expansion, may increase our costs of doing business internationally, and could harm our business. 25 Table of Contents We are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates. We are exposed to interest rate risk from our investment portfolio and from interest-rate sensitive assets, including assets underlying the customer balances we hold on our balance sheet as customer accounts. A low interest rate environment or reductions in interest rates may negatively impact our investment income and our net income. In addition, fluctuations in interest rates may adversely impact our customers’ spending levels and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amounts owed to us. Higher interest rates often lead to higher payment obligations by customers to us and other lenders under mortgage, credit card, and other consumer and merchant loans, which may reduce our customers’ ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore lead to increased delinquencies, charge-offs, and allowance for loan and interest receivable which could have an adverse effect on our net income.We have entered into a revolving credit facility and a 364-day delayed-draw term loan credit facility. We have borrowed under these credit facilities from time to time, and any borrowings under these credit facilities bear interest at a floating rate, exposing us to interest rate fluctuations. Use of our payments services for illegal purposes could harm our business. Our payment system is susceptible to potentially illegal or improper uses, including money laundering, terrorist financing, illegal online gambling, fraudulent sales of goods or services, illegal sales of prescription medications or controlled substances, piracy of software, movies, music, and other copyrighted or trademarked goods (in particular, digital goods), bank fraud, child pornography human trafficking, prohibited sales of alcoholic beverages or tobacco products, securities fraud, pyramid or ponzi schemes, or to facilitate other illegal activity. Use of our payment system for illegal or improper uses has subjected us, and may subject us in the future, to claims, individual and class action lawsuits, and government and regulatory investigations, inquiries, or requests that could result in liability and reputational harm for us. Moreover, certain activity that may be legal in one jurisdiction may be illegal in another jurisdiction, and a merchant may intentionally or inadvertently be found responsible for importing or exporting illegal goods, resulting in liability for us. Changes in law have increased the penalties for intermediaries providing payment services for certain illegal activities, and government authorities may consider additional payments-related proposals from time to time. Owners of intellectual property rights or government authorities may seek to bring legal action against providers of payments solutions, including PayPal, that are peripherally involved in the sale of infringing or allegedly infringing items. Any threatened or resulting claims could result in reputational harm, and any resulting liabilities, loss of transaction volume, or increased costs could harm our business. 26 Table of Contents Our failure to manage our customer funds and the assets underlying our customer funds properly could harm our business. We hold a substantial amount of funds belonging to our customers, including balances in customer accounts and funds being remitted to sellers of goods and services or recipients of person to person (“P2P”) transactions. In certain jurisdictions where we operate, we are required to hold eligible liquid assets, as defined by the relevant regulators in each jurisdiction, equal to at least 100% of the aggregate amount of all customer balances. Our ability to manage and account accurately for the assets underlying our customer funds and comply with applicable liquid asset requirements requires a high level of internal controls. As our business continues to grow and we expand our product offerings, we must continue to strengthen our associated internal controls. PayPal (Europe), with the permission of the CSSF, utilizes certain European customer balances held by our Luxembourg banking subsidiary to fund credit balances relating to certain customers. Our success requires significant public confidence in our ability to properly manage our customers’ balances and handle large and growing transaction volumes and amounts of customer funds. Any failure to maintain the necessary controls or to manage our customer funds and the assets underlying our customer funds accurately and in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements could result in reputational harm, lead customers to discontinue or reduce their use of our products and result in significant penalties and fines, which could materially harm our business. We are subject to regulatory activity and antitrust litigation under competition laws. We are subject to scrutiny by various government agencies under U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including antitrust and competition laws. An increasing number of governments are actively enforcing competition laws and regulations. Some jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to assert claims of anticompetitive conduct. Other companies and government agencies have in the past and may in the future allege that our actions violate the antitrust or competition laws of the U.S., individual states, other countries, or the European Commission, or otherwise constitute unfair competition. Our business agreements or arrangements with customers or other companies could give rise to regulatory action or antitrust litigation. Some regulators, particularly those outside of the U.S., may perceive that our products and services are used so broadly that otherwise uncontroversial business practices could be deemed anticompetitive. Any claims or investigations, even if without merit, may be very expensive to defend or respond to, involve negative publicity, and substantial diversion of management time and effort, and could result in reputational harm, significant judgments, fines or remedial actions against us, or require us to change our business practices. We are subject to patent litigation. We have been sued repeatedly for allegedly infringing other parties’ patents. At any given time, we are typically a defendant in a number of patent lawsuits. We expect that we will continue to be subject to patent infringement claims because, among other reasons:•our products and services continue to expand in scope and complexity and to converge with technologies not previously associated with the payments space;•we continue to expand into new business areas, including through acquisitions; and•the number of patent owners who may claim that we, any of the companies that we have acquired, or our customers infringe their patents, and the aggregate number of patents controlled by such patent owners, continues to increase.Such claims may be brought directly against us or against our users whom we may indemnify because we are contractually obligated to do so or we choose to do so as a business matter. We believe that many of the claims against us and other technology companies have been, and continue to be, initiated by third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims. In addition, we have seen significant patent disputes between operating companies in some technology industries. Patent claims, whether meritorious or not, are time-consuming and costly to manage, defend, and resolve, and could require us to make expensive changes in our methods of doing business, enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements, make substantial payments to satisfy adverse judgments or settle claims or proceedings, or cease conducting certain operations, which would harm our business. We may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or third parties may allege that we are infringing their intellectual property rights. The protection of our intellectual property, including our trademarks, patents, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, and trade secrets, is important to the success of our business. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on applicable laws and regulations in the U.S. and internationally, as well as a variety of administrative procedures. We also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights when offering or procuring products and services, including confidentiality and invention assignment agreements entered into with our employees and contractors and confidentiality agreements with parties with whom we conduct business.Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we offer our products and services. We may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our rights. Although we have generally taken measures to protect our intellectual property rights, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in protecting or enforcing our rights in every jurisdiction, or that contractual arrangements and other steps that we have taken to protect our intellectual property will prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our intellectual property or deter independent development of equivalent or superior intellectual property rights by others. If we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting, registering, or using trademarks and trade dress that infringe, dilute, or otherwise violate our trademark rights, the value of our brands could be diminished and our business could be adversely affected. Also, we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. We have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to others. These licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation. Any failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or significant costs incurred in doing so, could diminish the value of our intangible assets and materially harm our business.As the number of products in the technology and payments industries increases and the functionality of these products further overlaps, and as we acquire technology through acquisitions or licenses, we may become increasingly subject to intellectual property infringement and other claims. Litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of the patent and other intellectual property rights of others. The ultimate outcome of any allegation is often uncertain and, regardless of the outcome, any such claim, with or without merit, may be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert management’s time and attention from our business, and require us to, among other things, redesign or stop providing our products or services, pay substantial amounts to satisfy judgments or settle claims or lawsuits, pay substantial royalty or licensing fees, or satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with certain parties with whom we have commercial relationships. Our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights, or litigation or claims arising out of intellectual property matters, may harm or restrict our business. 27 Table of Contents We are regularly subject to general litigation, regulatory actions, and government inquiries. We are regularly subject to claims, individual and class action lawsuits, government and regulatory investigations, inquiries, actions or requests, and other proceedings alleging violations of laws, rules and regulations with respect to competition, antitrust, intellectual property, privacy, data protection, information security, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, sanctions, anti-corruption, consumer protection, fraud, accessibility, securities, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, services, charitable fundraising, contract disputes, escheatment of unclaimed or abandoned property, those matters described in Note 13—“Commitments and Contingencies—Litigation and Regulatory Matters—General Matters” to our consolidated financial statements, and other matters. In particular, our business faces ongoing consumer protection and intellectual property litigation, as discussed above. The number and significance of these disputes and inquiries may increase as our business expands in scale, scope and geographic reach, and our products and services increase in scale and complexity. In addition, the laws, rules and regulations affecting our business, including those pertaining to internet and mobile commerce, data protection, payments services, and credit, are subject to ongoing interpretation by the courts and governmental authorities, and the resulting uncertainty in the scope and application of these laws, rules, and regulations increases the risk that we will be subject to private claims and governmental actions alleging violations. The scope, outcome, and impact of claims, lawsuits, government investigations, disputes, and proceedings to which we are subject cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of the outcome, such matters can have an adverse impact, which may be material, on our business, results of operations, or financial condition because of legal costs, diversion of management resources, reputational damage, and other factors. Determining reserves for our pending litigation and regulatory proceedings is a complex, fact-intensive process that involves a high degree of judgment. Resolving one or more of such legal and regulatory proceedings or other matters could potentially require us to make substantial payments to satisfy judgments, fines, or penalties or to settle claims or proceedings, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. These proceedings could also result in reputational harm, criminal sanctions, consent decrees, or orders that prevent us from offering certain products or services, require us to change our business practices in costly ways, or develop non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies. Any of these consequences could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.While certain of our customer agreements contain arbitration provisions with class action waiver provisions that may limit our exposure to consumer class action litigation, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in enforcing these arbitration provisions, including the class action waiver provisions, in the future or in any given case. Legislative, administrative, or regulatory developments may directly or indirectly prohibit or limit the use of pre-dispute arbitration clauses and class action waiver provisions. Any such prohibitions or limitations on or discontinuation of the use of, such arbitration or class action waiver provisions could subject us to additional lawsuits, including additional consumer class action litigation, and significantly limit our ability to avoid exposure from consumer class action litigation. 28 Table of Contents Changes in U.S. tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations, and financial conditions. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive Federal tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act made changes to the corporate tax rate, business-related deductions, and taxation of foreign earnings, among others, that are generally effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. Throughout calendar year 2018, the U.S. Treasury and certain states issued proposed and final legislation and clarifying guidance with respect to the various provisions of the Tax Act. Additional legislation and guidance is expected to be issued in 2019, which could have a material adverse impact on the value of our U.S. deferred tax assets, result in significant changes to currently computed income tax liabilities for past and current tax periods, and increase our future U.S. tax expense. We are continuing to evaluate the Tax Act and its requirements, as well as its application to our business and its impact on our effective tax rate. At this stage, it is unclear how many U.S. states will continue to incorporate these federal law changes, or portions thereof, into their tax codes. The implementation by us of new practices and processes designed to comply with, and benefit from, the Tax Act and its rules and regulations could require us to make substantial changes to our business practices, allocate additional resources, and increase our costs, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities. The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation and significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, compliance with the Tax Act may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the Company, the use of estimates in our financial statements, and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions.Like many other multinational corporations, we are subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Our determination of our tax liability is always subject to audit and review by applicable domestic and foreign authorities, and we are currently undergoing a number of investigations, audits, and reviews by authorities throughout the world. Any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could have a negative effect on our business, and the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the periods for which such determination is made. While we have established reserves based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventualities, these reserves may prove to be insufficient.In addition, our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated, or by the incurrence of losses, in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, as a result of gains on our foreign exchange risk management program; or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items.Various levels of government, such as U.S. federal and state legislatures, and international organizations, such as the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) and the EU, are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative or regulatory action to increase tax revenue. Any such tax reform or other legislative or regulatory actions could increase our effective tax rate. 29 Table of Contents We and our merchants may be subject to sales reporting and record-keeping obligations. A number of U.S. states, the U.S. federal government and foreign countries have implemented or are in the process of implementing reporting or record-keeping obligations on companies that engage in or facilitate ecommerce to improve tax compliance. Additionally, a number of jurisdictions are reviewing whether payment service providers and other intermediaries could be deemed to be the legal agent of merchants for certain tax purposes. We have modified our systems to meet known requirements and expect further modifications will be required to comply with future requirements, which may negatively impact our customer experience and increase operational costs. Any failure by us to comply with these and similar reporting and record-keeping obligations could result in substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions, adversely impact our ability to do business in certain jurisdictions, and harm our business. In addition, in June 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. that states may collect internet sales tax on online purchases made outside of the state, which could adversely affect some of our merchants and indirectly harm our customers. Acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic investments, and other strategic transactions could result in operating difficulties and could harm our business. Acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic investments, and other strategic transactions are important elements of our overall corporate strategy. We expect to continue to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions as part of our overall business strategy, including business combinations, acquisitions, and dispositions of certain businesses, technologies, services, products, and other assets, as well as joint ventures, strategic investments, and commercial and strategic partnerships. These transactions may involve significant challenges, uncertainties and risks, including:•the potential loss of key customers, vendors, and other key business partners of the companies we acquire, or dispose of, following and continuing after announcement of our transaction plans;•difficulty making strategic hires of new employees, declining employee morale, and retention issues affecting employees (particularly the potential loss of key personnel) of companies that we acquire or dispose of, which may result from changes in compensation, management, reporting relationships, future prospects, or the direction of the acquired or disposed business;•diversion of management time and focus;•inability to realize synergies expected to result from an acquisition;•the need to and difficulty of integrating the operations, systems (including accounting, compliance, management, information, human resource, and other administrative systems), technologies, data assets, products, and personnel of each acquired company, which is an inherently risky and potentially lengthy and costly process;•the need to and difficulty of implementing and/or enhancing controls, procedures, and policies appropriate for a larger public company at acquired companies which, prior to the acquisition, may have lacked such controls, procedures, and policies or whose controls, procedures, and policies did not meet applicable legal and regulatory standards;•the inefficiencies and lack of control that may result if integration of acquired companies is delayed or not implemented, and unforeseen difficulties and costs that may arise as a result;•potential exposure to new or increased regulatory oversight and regulatory obligations associated with new products and services or entry into new markets;•risks associated with our expansion into new international markets;•unidentified issues discovered in our due diligence process, including product or service quality issues, intellectual property issues, and legal contingencies;•risks associated with the complexity of entering into and effectively managing joint ventures, strategic investments, and other strategic partnerships;•risks associated with undetected cyberattacks or security breaches at companies that we acquire or with which we may combine or partner;•lawsuits or regulatory actions resulting from the transaction;•liability for activities or conduct of the acquired company before the acquisition, including legal and regulatory claims or disputes, violations of laws and regulations, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities;•the acquisition of new customer and employee personal information, which in and of itself may require regulatory approval and/or additional controls, policies, and procedures, and subject us to additional exposure and additional complexity and costs of compliance; and•our dependence on the accounting, financial reporting, operating metrics and similar systems, controls and processes of acquired businesses, and the risk that errors or irregularities in those systems, controls, and processes will lead to errors in our financial statements or make it more difficult to manage the acquired business.At any given time, we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more of these or other types of transactions, any of which could, individually or in the aggregate, be material to our financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying, negotiating, and consummating favorable transaction opportunities. It may take us longer than expected to fully realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions, and those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Any acquisitions or dispositions may also require us to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt (and increased interest expense), recognize liabilities, and record amortization expenses related to intangible assets or write-offs of goodwill or intangibles, which could dilute the economic and voting rights of our stockholders and adversely affect our results of operations and the interests of holders of our indebtedness, as applicable.We completed our acquisition of iZettle AB (publ) (“iZettle”) on September 20, 2018. Prior to the closing of the acquisition, the UK Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”) initiated a review of the transaction. On December 5, 2018, the CMA referred the acquisition for a Phase 2 investigation and on December 24, 2018, directed PayPal to appoint a monitoring trustee. The deadline for the final decision is May 21, 2019. PayPal is working cooperatively with the CMA and has agreed to hold parts of the PayPal and iZettle businesses separate as agreed with the CMA, pending completion of the CMA’s investigation. Our ability to successfully and timely integrate iZettle’s business and operations with ours and realize the potential synergies and anticipated benefits from the acquisition is subject to the timing and possible outcome of the CMA’s review. The CMA has broad discretion and may impose requirements, limitations or costs, mandate remedies, such as divestitures of certain business assets, or place additional restrictions on the conduct of our businesses, to ensure sufficient competition in the U.K. market. No assurance can be given as to the ultimate impact and outcome of the CMA review, that approval from the CMA will be obtained, or the terms and conditions of such approval.Because acquisitions are inherently risky, our transactions may not be successful and may, in some cases, harm our operating results or financial condition. Any acquisitions or dispositions may also require us to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt (and increased interest expense), recognize liabilities, and record amortization expenses related to intangible assets or impairment of goodwill or intangibles, which could dilute the economic and voting rights of our stockholders and adversely affect our results of operations and the interests of holders of our indebtedness, as applicable.Joint ventures and minority investments inherently involve a lesser degree of influence over business operations, thereby potentially increasing the financial, legal, operational, and/or compliance risks associated with the joint venture or minority investment. In addition, we may be dependent on joint venture partners, controlling shareholders, management or other persons or entities who control them and who may have business interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours. Business decisions or other actions or omissions of the joint venture partners, controlling shareholders, management or other persons or entities who control joint ventures or companies in which we invest may adversely affect the value of our investment, result in litigation or regulatory action against us, and otherwise damage our reputation and brand. 30 Table of Contents There are risks associated with our indebtedness. We have incurred indebtedness, and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations and generate sufficient cash flows to service such debt. In addition, changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity securities and increase our borrowing costs. If our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, the interest rate payable by us under out indebtedness may increase. In addition, any downgrades to our credit ratings may affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and may affect the terms of any such financing. Any of these factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk. We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, including the following:•networks, banks, payment processors, and payment gateways that link us to the payment card and bank clearing networks to process transactions;•unaffiliated third-party lenders to originate the U.S. PayPal Credit and PayPal Mastercard consumer credit products, PayPal Working Capital, and PayPal Business Loan products;•third parties that provide loan servicing and customer statements processing;•third parties that provide certain outsourced customer support and product development functions, which are critical to our operations; and•third parties that provide facilities, infrastructure, components, and services, including data center facilities and cloud computing.Because we rely on third parties to provide certain of our services and to facilitate certain of our business activities, we face increased operational risk. These third parties may be subject to financial, legal, regulatory, and labor issues, cybersecurity incidents, privacy breaches, service terminations, disruptions or interruptions, or other problems, which may impose additional costs or requirements on us or prevent these third parties from providing services to us or our customers on our behalf, which could harm our business. In addition, these third parties may breach their agreements with us, disagree with our interpretation of contract terms or applicable laws and regulations, refuse to continue or renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms or at all, fail or refuse to process transactions or provide other services adequately, take actions that degrade the functionality of our services, impose additional costs or requirements on us or our customers, or give preferential treatment to competitive services. There can be no assurance that third parties who provide services directly to us or our customers on our behalf will continue to do so on acceptable terms, or at all. If any third parties do not adequately or appropriately provide their services or perform their responsibilities to us or our customers on our behalf, we may be unable to procure alternatives from other third parties in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all, and we may be subject to business disruptions, losses or costs to remediate any of the deficiencies, customer dissatisfaction, reputational damage, legal or regulatory proceedings, or other adverse consequences which could harm our business. 31 Table of Contents Our retail point of sale solutions expose us to additional risks. We have announced several retail point of sale solutions, which enable merchants to accept payments using a payments card reader attached to, or otherwise communicating with, a mobile device or to scan payment cards and codes using the mobile device’s embedded camera, and which enable consumers to use their mobile devices to pay at the point of sale. We have entered into strategic partnerships with major payment card networks to further expand our relationship in a way that will make it easier for merchants to accept and consumers to choose to pay for transactions utilizing credit and debit cards via PayPal at the point of sale. Those agreements provide us with access to each of these partner's tokenization services in the U.S. for in-store point-of-sale PayPal transactions, which we expect will increase the number of point of sale transactions that we process. We believe that our recent acquisition of iZettle will enable us to further expand our in-store presence. As we continue to expand our product and service offerings at the retail point of sale, we will face additional risks, including:•increased expectations from offline retailers regarding the reliability and availability of our systems and services and correspondingly lower amounts of downtime, which we may not be able to meet;•significant competition at the retail point of sale, particularly from established payment card providers, many of which have substantially greater resources than we do;•increased targeting by fraudsters; given that our fraud models are less developed in this area, we may experience increases in fraud and associated transaction losses as we adjust to fraudulent activity at the point of sale;•exposure to product liability claims to the extent that hardware devices that we produce for use at the retail point of sale malfunction or are not in compliance with laws, which could result in substantial liability and require product recalls or other actions;•exposure to additional laws, rules, and regulations;•increased reliance on third parties involved with processing in-store payments, including independent software providers, electronic point of sale providers, hardware providers (such as cash register and pin-pad providers), payment processors, and banks that enable in-store transactions; and•lower operating income than our other payment solutions.Unless we are able to successfully manage these risks, including driving adoption of, and significant volume through, our retail point of sale solutions over time, our business may be harmed. 32 Table of Contents Our success largely depends on key personnel. Because competition for our key employees is intense, we may not be able to attract, retain, and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our business. The loss of key personnel could harm our ability to maintain and grow our business. Our future success and performance are significantly dependent upon the continued services of key personnel, including our executive team and other highly skilled employees, and our ability to attract, retain, and motivate such personnel. Competition for key personnel is intense, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area, where our corporate headquarters are located and where the cost of living is high, and we may be unable to successfully attract, integrate, or retain sufficiently qualified key personnel. In making employment decisions, particularly in the technology and payments industries, job candidates often consider the value of the equity awards they would receive in connection with their employment, and our stock price volatility, or a perception that the market price of our stock may not increase or may increase more slowly than stock prices at other technology or payments companies, may make it more difficult to attract, retain, and motivate employees. We may be limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws or policies. Potential changes in U.S. immigration policy may make it difficult to renew or obtain visas for any highly skilled personnel that we have hired or are actively recruiting. Negative sentiments towards the U.S. as a result of these potential changes may also adversely affect our international recruiting efforts. Furthermore, legislative or administrative changes to immigration or visa laws and regulations may impair our hiring processes or projects involving personnel who are not citizens of the country where the work is to be performed. In addition, we do not have long-term employment agreements with any of our key personnel and do not maintain any “key person” life insurance policies. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel, or if we are not able to attract or retain highly qualified key personnel effectively, could harm our business and growth prospects. We are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our products and services. Companies providing online services may be subject to claims relating to information disseminated through them, including claims alleging defamation, libel, harassment, hate speech, breach of contract, invasion of privacy, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through the services, among other things. The laws relating to the liability of companies providing online services for information disseminated through their services are subject to frequent challenges. We are also subject to potential liability to third parties for the customer-provided content on our products and services, particularly in jurisdictions outside the U.S. where the applicable laws are unsettled. If we become liable for information provided by our customers and carried on our products and services, we could be directly harmed and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability, including expending substantial resources or discontinuing certain product or service offerings, which could harm our business. Risks Related to Our Separation from eBay If the distribution, together with certain related transactions, does not qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), eBay, PayPal and eBay stockholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities. On July 17, 2015, we became an independent publicly traded company through the pro rata distribution by eBay Inc. of 100% of our outstanding common stock to eBay’s stockholders (which we sometimes refer to as the “separation” or the “distribution”). eBay received an opinion from its outside legal counsel regarding the qualification of the distribution, together with certain related transactions, as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code. The opinion was based on and relied on, among other things, certain facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements, and undertakings of eBay and of us, including those relating to the past and future conduct of eBay and of us. If any of these representations, statements, or undertakings were, or became, inaccurate or incomplete, or if eBay or we breach any of our respective covenants in the separation documents, the opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized.Notwithstanding the opinion of counsel, the IRS could determine that the distribution, together with certain related transactions, should be treated as a taxable transaction if the IRS determines that any of these representations, assumptions, or undertakings upon which such opinion was based are incorrect or have been violated or if the IRS disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel. An opinion of counsel is not binding on the IRS or any court and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge the conclusions reached in the opinion. The IRS did not provide any opinion in advance of the separation that our proposed transaction is tax-free.If the distribution, together with certain related transactions, failed to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code, in general, eBay would recognize taxable gain as if it had sold the PayPal common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value, eBay stockholders who received PayPal common stock in the distribution may be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares, and we could incur significant liabilities. 33 Table of Contents There are risks associated with our relationship with eBay. In connection with our separation from eBay, we entered into a separation and distribution agreement with eBay, as well as various other agreements, including an operating agreement, a tax matters agreement, an employee matters agreement, an intellectual property matters agreement, a data sharing addendum, and a product development agreement. The separation agreement, the tax matters agreement, the employee matters agreement, and the intellectual property matters agreement determined the allocation of assets and liabilities (including by means of licensing) between the companies following the separation for those respective areas and include associated indemnification obligations. The operating agreement, the data sharing addendum, and the product development agreement establish certain commercial relationships between eBay and us related to payment processing, credit, and data sharing. Disputes between eBay and us have arisen and others may arise in the future; an adverse outcome in such matters could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If either we or eBay are unable to satisfy our performance, payment, or indemnification obligations under these agreements, we could incur operational difficulties or losses or be required to make substantial indemnification or other payments to eBay.Our relationship with eBay is governed, in part, by an operating agreement entered into at separation with a term of five years (expiring July 2020). This operating agreement defines a number of important elements of our commercial relationship with eBay, as well as certain obligations and restrictions that limit PayPal’s provision of services to certain competitive platform operators of eBay (as specified in the operating agreement). eBay remains a significant source of our revenues and operating income. We expect the portion of our revenue and operating income attributable to eBay to continue to decline due to various factors (many of which are beyond our control), including the expiration (or earlier termination) of the operating agreement with eBay, and the extent to which eBay intermediates payments on its platform (including by acting as a merchant of record), limits the availability of PayPal as a payment option or offers (or promotes) alternative payment options, directs transactions on its platforms to different providers of payment services, or eliminates or modifies its risk management or customer protection programs on its platforms, which could result in customer dissatisfaction, reduction in eBay volume, and other consequences adverse to our business. If we are unable to generate sufficient business from our non-eBay customers to offset the expected reduction in the portion of our business attributable to eBay, it could materially impact the growth in our business and our ability to meet our long-term financial targets. Risks Related to Our Common Stock The price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly. The price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including, but not limited to:•actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;•changes in financial estimates by us or securities analysts and recommendations or lack of coverage and reports by securities analysts;•changes in our capital structure;•the activities of our competitors; •speculation, coverage, or sentiment in the media or the investment community;•the operating and stock price performance and valuation of comparable companies;•our quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in our industry;•the public's reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements, and our filings with the SEC;•additions or departures of key personnel; •announcements related to litigation, regulation, or disputes;•changes to the regulatory and legal environment under which we operate; and•market conditions or trends in the payments industry, the industries of merchants, and the domestic and worldwide economy as a whole.As a result of these and other factors, investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above the price at which they purchase our common stock. In addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies like us. These broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In addition, in the past, some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have been subject to class action or derivative lawsuits. The filing of a lawsuit against us, regardless of the outcome, could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, as it could result in substantial legal costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources. 34 Table of Contents Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the state courts of the State of Delaware, or, if no state court located in the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the District of Delaware, as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could discourage lawsuits against us and our directors and officers. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that unless the corporation otherwise determines, the state courts of the State of Delaware, or, if no state court located in the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the District of Delaware, will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors or officers to us or our stockholders, any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“DGCL”) or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes with us or our directors or officers, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors and officers. Alternatively, if a court outside of Delaware were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above, we could incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may prevent or delay an acquisition of our company, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock. Certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of deterring coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and by encouraging prospective acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others:•rules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings;•the fact that directors may not be elected, removed, or replaced at stockholder-requested special meetings unless a person, entity, or group owns at least a majority of our outstanding common stock;•the right of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock and to determine the voting, dividend, and other rights of preferred stock without stockholder approval;•the ability of our directors, and not stockholders, to fill vacancies on our board of directors in most circumstances and to determine the size of our board of directors;•the prohibition on stockholders acting by written consent; and•the absence of cumulative rights in the election of directors.We have also elected not to be governed by Section 203 of the DGCL, which provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that acquire, or are affiliated with a person that acquires, more than 15% of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation, or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the date on which that person or its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15% of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, however, contains a provision that generally mirrors Section 203 of the DGCL, except that it provides for a 20% threshold instead of the 15% provided for by the DGCL. These provisions could delay or prevent a change of control that our stockholders may favor.While these provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers, they will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and may delay or prevent an acquisition that our Board of Directors determines is not in the best interests of us and our stockholders. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. The following discussion is divided into three sections. The first section, which begins immediately following this paragraph, discusses some of the risks that may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The second section, captioned “Risks Related to Our Separation from eBay” discusses some of the risks relating to our separation from eBay in July 2015 into an independent publicly traded company. The third section, captioned “Risks Related to Our Common Stock,” discusses some of the risks relating to an investment in our Common Stock. You should carefully review all of these sections in addition to the other information appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, for important information regarding risks and uncertainties that affect us. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. 11 Table of Contents Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business, Results of Operations, and Financial Condition We face substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry. The global payments industry is highly competitive, rapidly changing, highly innovative, and increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny. We compete against a wide range of businesses, including businesses that are larger than we are, have a more dominant and secure position, or offer other products and services to consumers and merchants that we do not offer, as well as smaller companies that may be able to respond more quickly to regulatory and technological changes. Many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Competition may also intensify as businesses enter into business combinations and alliances, and established companies in other segments expand to become competitive with different aspects of our business.We compete primarily on the basis of the following:•ability to attract, retain, and engage both merchants and consumers with our two-sided platform;•ability to demonstrate to merchants that they may achieve incremental sales by using and offering our services to consumers;•consumer confidence in the safety and security of transactions on our Payments Platform, including the ability for consumers to use our products and services without sharing their financial information with the merchant or any other party they are paying;•simplicity and transparency of our fee structure;•ability to develop products and services across multiple commerce channels, including mobile payments, credit products, and payments at the retail point of sale;•trust in our dispute resolution and buyer and seller protection programs;•customer service experience;•brand recognition and preference;•website, mobile platform and application onboarding, ease-of-use, speed, availability, and dependability;•the technology and payment agnostic nature of our Payments Platform;•system reliability and data security;•ability to assist merchants in complying with payments-related laws and regulations ;•ease and quality of integration into third-party mobile applications and operating systems; and•quality of developer tools, such as our application programming interfaces and software development kits.We compete against a wide range of businesses with varying roles in all forms of payments, including:•paper-based transactions (principally cash and checks);•providers of traditional payment methods, particularly credit and debit cards and Automated Clearing House transactions (in particular, well-established banks);•payment networks which facilitate payments for credit card users;•providers of “digital wallets” which offer customers the ability to pay online and/or in-store through a variety of payment methods, including with mobile applications, through contactless payments, and with a variety of payment cards;•providers of mobile payments solutions that use tokenized card data approaches and contactless payments (e.g., near field communication (“NFC”) or host card emulation functionality) to eliminate the need to swipe or insert a card or enter a personal identification number or password;•payment-card processors that offer their services to merchants, including for “card on file” payments where the merchant invites the consumer to select a payment method for their first transaction and to use the same payment method for subsequent transactions;•providers of “person-to-person” payments that facilitate individuals sending money with an email address or mobile phone number;•merchants and merchant associations providing proprietary payment networks to facilitate payments within their own retail network;•money remitters;•providers of card readers for mobile devices and of other point-of-sale and multi-channel technologies; and•providers of virtual currencies and distributed ledger technologies.We often partner with many of these businesses and we consider the ability to continue establishing these partnerships as important to our business. Competition for relationships with these partners is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to establish, grow, or maintain these partner relationships.We also face competition and potential competition from:•service providers that provide online merchants the ability to offer their customers the option of paying for purchases from their bank account or paying on credit;•issuers of stored value products targeted at online payments;•other global online and mobile payment-services providers;•services targeting users of social networks and online gaming, including those offering social commerce and peer-to-peer payments;•payment services enabling banking customers to send and receive payments through their bank account, including through immediate or real-time payments systems;•ecommerce services that provide special offers linked to a specific payment provider; •services that help merchants accept and manage virtual currencies; and•electronic funds transfer services as a method of payment for both online and offline transactions.Some of these competitors have larger customer bases, volume, scale, resources, and market share than we do, which may provide them significant competitive advantages. Some of our competitors may also be subject to less burdensome licensing, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, and other regulatory requirements. They may devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of products and services, and they may offer lower prices or more effectively introduce their own innovative programs, products, and services that adversely impact our growth.If we are not able to differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors, drive value for our customers, or effectively align our resources with our goals and objectives, we may not be able to compete effectively in the market. 12 Table of Contents Substantially all of our net revenues each quarter come primarily from transactions involving payments during that quarter, which may result in significant fluctuations in our operating results that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, as well as the trading price of our common stock. Substantially all of our net revenues each quarter come primarily from transactions involving payments during that quarter. As a result, our operating and financial results have varied on a quarterly basis during our operating history, and may continue to fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including as a result of the risks set forth in this “Risk Factors” section. It is difficult for us to forecast accurately the level or source of our revenues or earnings. In view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful, and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance. Due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting revenues, it is also difficult to forecast expenses as a percentage of net revenues. Quarterly and annual expenses as a percentage of net revenues reflected in our financial statements may be significantly different from historical or projected rates. Our operating results in one or more future quarters may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. The trading price of our common stock may decline significantly as a result of the factors described in this paragraph. Global and regional economic conditions could harm our business. Our operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions. Uncertainty about global and regional economic events and conditions may result in consumers and businesses postponing or lowering spending in response to, among other factors:•tighter credit, •higher unemployment, •consumer debt levels or reduced consumer confidence.•financial market volatility, •fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, •changes and uncertainties related to government fiscal and tax policies, including increased duties, tariffs, or other restrictions,•the inability of the U.S. Congress to enact a budget in a fiscal year, another sequestration, and/or another shutdown of the U.S. government,•government austerity programs, and •other negative financial news or macroeconomic developments.These and other global and regional economic events and conditions, including Brexit, could have a material adverse impact on the demand for our products and services, including a reduction in the volume and size of transactions on our Payments Platform. In addition, any financial turmoil affecting the banking system or financial markets could cause additional consolidation of the financial services industry, significant financial service institution failures, new or incremental tightening in the credit markets, low liquidity, and extreme volatility or distress in the fixed income, credit, currency, and equity markets, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. See also the risk factor captioned, “The United Kingdom's departure from the EU could adversely affect us.” 13 Table of Contents If we cannot keep pace with rapid technological developments to provide new and innovative products and services, the use of our products and services and, consequently, our revenues could decline. Rapid, significant, and disruptive technological changes impact the industries in which we operate, including developments in payment card tokenization, cryptocurrencies, mobile, social commerce (i.e., ecommerce through social networks), authentication, virtual currencies (including distributed ledger and blockchain technologies), and NFC and other proximity payment technology, such as contactless payments. As a result, we expect new services and technologies to continue to emerge and evolve, and we cannot predict the effects of technological changes on our business. In addition to our own initiatives and innovations, we rely in part on third parties, including some of our competitors, for the development of and access to new or evolving technologies. These third parties may restrict or prevent our access to, or utilization of, those technologies, as well as their platforms or products. In addition, we may not be able to accurately predict which technological developments or innovations will become widely adopted and how those technologies may be regulated. We expect that new services and technologies applicable to the industries in which we operate will continue to emerge and may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies we currently use in our products and services. Developing and incorporating new technologies into our products and services may require substantial expenditures, take considerable time, and ultimately may not be successful. In addition, our ability to adopt new products and services and to develop new technologies may be inhibited by industry-wide standards, payments networks, changes to laws and regulations, resistance to change from consumers or merchants, third-party intellectual property rights, or other factors. Our success will depend on our ability to develop and incorporate new technologies and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards; if we are unable to do so in a timely or cost-effective manner, our business could be harmed. Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to our reputation, business, and financial condition. Our business involves the collection, storage, processing, and transmission of customers’ personal data, including financial information and information about how they interact with our Payments Platform. In addition, a significant number of our customers authorize us to bill their payment cards or bank accounts directly for all transaction and other fees charged by us. We have built our reputation on the premise that our Payments Platform offers customers a more secure way to make payments. An increasing number of organizations, including large merchants, businesses, technology companies, and financial institutions, as well as government institutions, have disclosed breaches of their information security systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks, including on their websites, mobile applications, and infrastructure.The techniques used to obtain unauthorized, improper, or illegal access to our systems, our data or customers' data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and have become increasingly complex and sophisticated, may be difficult to detect quickly, and often are not recognized or detected until after they have been launched against a target. We expect that unauthorized parties will continue to attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means, including hacking into our systems or facilities or those of our customers, partners, or vendors, or attempting to fraudulently induce (for example, through spear phishing attacks) our employees, customers, partners, vendors, or other users of our systems into disclosing user names, passwords, payment card information, or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems. Certain efforts may be state-sponsored and supported by significant financial and technological resources, making them even more sophisticated and difficult to detect. Numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats, including advanced and persisting cyberattacks, phishing and social engineering schemes, could compromise the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the data in our systems. We believe that PayPal is a particularly attractive target for such breaches and attacks due to our name and brand recognition and the widespread adoption and use of our products and services. Although we have developed systems and processes designed to protect our data and customer data and to prevent data loss and other security breaches, and expect to continue to expend significant resources to bolster these protections, there can be no assurance that these security measures provide absolute security. Our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyberattacks or security breaches, and third parties may be able to access our customers’ personal or proprietary information and payment card data that are stored on or accessible through those systems. We have experienced from time to time, and may experience in the future, breaches of our security measures due to human error, malfeasance, system errors or vulnerabilities, or other irregularities. Actual or perceived breaches of our security could, among other things:•interrupt our operations, •result in our systems or services being unavailable, •result in improper disclosure of data, •materially harm our reputation and brands, •result in significant regulatory scrutiny and legal and financial exposure, •cause us to incur significant remediation costs, •lead to loss of customer confidence in, or decreased use of, our products and services, •divert the attention of management from the operation of our business, •result in significant compensation or contractual penalties from us to our customers and their business partners as a result of losses to them or claims by them, and •adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, any cyberattacks or data security breaches affecting companies that we acquire or our customers, partners, or vendors (including data center and cloud computing providers) could have similar negative effects. See Note 4—“Business Combinations,” Note 5—“Goodwill and Intangible Assets” and Note 13—“Commitments and Contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements for disclosure relating to the suspension of operations of TIO Networks (“TIO”) (which we acquired in July 2017) as part of an investigation of security vulnerability of the TIO platform. Actual or perceived vulnerabilities or data breaches have led and may lead to claims against us.In addition, under payment card rules and our contracts with our card processors, if there is a breach of payment card information that we store, or that is stored by our direct payment card processing vendors, we could be liable to the payment card issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses. We also expect to expend significant additional resources to protect against security or privacy breaches, and may be required to redress problems caused by breaches. Financial services regulators in various jurisdictions, including the U.S. and the EU, have implemented authentication requirements for banks and payment processors intended to reduce online fraud, which could impose significant costs, require us to change our business practices, make it more difficult for new customers to join PayPal, and reduce the ease of use of our products, which could harm our business. While we maintain insurance policies, they may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches. 14 Table of Contents Systems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our websites, applications, products, or services could harm our business. Our systems and those of our services providers and partners may experience service interruptions or degradation because of hardware and software defects or malfunctions, distributed denial-of-service and other cyberattacks, human error, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, and other natural disasters, power losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist attacks, computer viruses or other malware, or other events. We have experienced from time to time, and may experience in the future, disruptions in our systems due to break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. In addition, as a provider of payments solutions, we are subject to heightened scrutiny by regulators that may require specific business continuity, resiliency and disaster recovery plans, and more rigorous testing of such plans, which may be costly and time-consuming and may divert our resources from other business priorities.We have experienced and expect to continue to experience system failures, denial-of-service attacks, and other events or conditions from time to time that interrupt the availability, or reduce or adversely affect the speed or functionality of our products and services. These events have resulted and likely will result in loss of revenue. A prolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in the availability, speed, or functionality of our products and services could materially harm our business. Frequent or persistent interruptions in our services could cause current or potential customers to believe that our systems are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid or reduce the use of our products and services, and could permanently harm our reputation and brands. Moreover, if any system failure or similar event results in damages to our customers or their business partners, these customers or partners could seek significant compensation or contractual penalties from us for their losses, and those claims, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and costly for us to address, and could have other consequences described in this “Risk Factors” section under the caption “Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to our reputation, business, results of operation, and financial condition.”Our Payments Platform has experienced and may in the future experience intermittent unavailability. The full-time availability and expeditious delivery of our products and services is critical to our goal of gaining widespread acceptance among consumers and merchants for digital payments. We have undertaken certain system upgrades and re-platforming efforts designed to improve our reliability and speed. These efforts are costly and time-consuming, involve significant technical risk and may divert our resources from new features and products, and there can be no guarantee that these efforts will succeed. Because we are a regulated financial institution in certain jurisdictions, frequent or persistent site interruptions could lead to regulatory scrutiny, significant fines and penalties, and mandatory and costly changes to our business practices, and ultimately could cause us to lose existing licenses that we need to operate or prevent or delay us from obtaining additional licenses that may be required for our business.We also rely on facilities, components, and services supplied by third parties, including data center facilities and cloud storage services. If these third parties cease to provide the facilities or services, experience operational interference or disruptions, breach their agreements with us, fail to perform their obligations and meet our expectations, or experience a cybersecurity incident, our operations could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected, which could result in customer dissatisfaction and damage to our reputation and brands, and materially and adversely affect our business. We do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for all losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of systems failures and similar events.In addition, we are continually improving and upgrading our information systems and technologies. Implementation of new systems and technologies is complex, expensive, and time-consuming. If we fail to timely and successfully implement new information systems and technologies, or improvements or upgrades to existing information systems and technologies, or if such systems and technologies do not operate as intended, this could have an adverse impact on our business, internal controls (including internal controls over financial reporting), results of operations, and financial condition. 15 Table of Contents Changes to payment card networks or bank fees, rules, or practices could harm our business. We rely on banks or other payment processors to process transactions and pay fees for their services. From time to time, payment card networks have increased, and may continue to increase in the future, the interchange fees and assessments that they charge for each transaction that accesses their networks. Payment card networks have imposed, and may impose in the future, special fees or assessments for transactions that are executed through a “digital wallet” such as PayPal’s, which could particularly impact us and significantly increase our costs. Our payment card processors may have the right to pass any increases in interchange fees and assessments on to us as well as increase their own fees for processing, which could increase our operating costs and reduce our operating income. We have entered into strategic partnerships with Visa and Mastercard and other credit card networks to further expand our relationships in a way that will make it easier for merchants to accept and consumers to choose to pay with their respective credit and debit cards. During the terms of these agreements, Visa and Mastercard have each agreed to not enact or impose any fees or rules that solely target PayPal. Upon termination of the agreements, PayPal could become subject to special digital wallet fees or other special assessments.In addition, in some jurisdictions, governmental regulations have required payment card networks to reduce interchange fees. Any material change in credit or debit card interchange rates in the U.S. or other markets, including as a result of changes in interchange fee limitations, could adversely affect our competitive position against traditional credit and debit card service providers and our business.We are required to comply with payment card network operating rules, including special operating rules for payment service providers to merchants. We have agreed to reimburse our processors for any fines they are assessed by payment card networks as a result of any rule violations by us or our merchants. We may also be directly liable to the payment card networks for rule violations. The payment card networks set and interpret the card operating rules and have alleged from time to time that various aspects of our business model violate these operating rules. If such allegations are not resolved favorably, they may result in significant fines and penalties or require changes in our business practices that may be costly. The payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or re-interpret existing rules that we or our processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow, or costly to implement. As a result, we could lose our ability to give consumers the option of using payment cards to fund their payments or the choice of currency in which they would like their payment card to be charged. If we are unable to accept payment cards or are limited in our ability to do so, our business would be adversely affected.We and our payment card processors have implemented specific business processes for merchants to comply with payment card network operating rules for providing services to merchants. Any failure to comply with these rules could result in fines. We are also subject to fines from payment card networks if we fail to detect that merchants are engaging in activities that are illegal or that are considered “high risk,” including the sale of certain types of digital content. For “high risk” merchants, we must either prevent such merchants from using PayPal services or register such merchants with the payment card networks and conduct additional monitoring with respect to such merchants. Although the amount of these fines has not been material to date, additional fines in the future could become significant and could result in a termination of our ability to accept payment cards or require changes in our process for registering new customers, which would adversely affect our business. Payment card network rules may also increase the cost of, impose restrictions on, or otherwise negatively impact the development of, our retail point-of-sale solutions, which may negatively impact their deployment and adoption. 16 Table of Contents Failure to deal effectively with fraud, fictitious transactions, bad transactions, and negative customer experiences would increase our loss rate and harm our business, and could severely diminish merchant and consumer confidence in and use of our services. Our operations process a significant volume and dollar value of transactions on a daily basis. In the event that merchants do not fulfill their obligations to consumers or a merchant's goods or services do not match the merchant’s description, we may incur substantial losses as a result of claims from consumers. We seek to recover such losses from the merchant, but may not be able to recover in full if the merchant is unwilling or unable to pay. In addition, in the event of the bankruptcy or other business interruption of a merchant that sells goods or services in advance of the date of their delivery or use (e.g., airline, cruise or concert tickets, custom-made goods, and subscriptions), we could be liable to the buyers of such goods or services, either through our buyer protection program or through chargebacks on payment cards used by customers to fund their payment. While we have established allowances for transaction losses based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such losses incurred as of the reporting date, these reserves may be insufficient.We also incur substantial losses from claims that the consumer did not authorize the purchase, from customer fraud, from erroneous transactions, and as a result of customers who have closed bank accounts or have insufficient funds in their bank accounts to satisfy payments. In addition, if losses incurred by us related to payment card transactions become excessive, they could potentially result in our losing the right to accept payment cards for payment, which would harm our business. We have taken measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud, but these measures need to be continually improved and may not be effective against fraud, particularly new and continually evolving forms of fraud or in connection with new product offerings. If these measures do not succeed, our business could be harmed. We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that could materially and adversely affect our financial results. We have significant operations internationally that are denominated in foreign currencies, including the British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar, and Canadian Dollar, which subject us to foreign currency risk. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar versus the British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar, and Canadian Dollar impacts the translation of our net revenues generated in these foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar. In connection with providing our services in multiple currencies, we may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the times that we set them. Given that we also hold some corporate and customer funds in non-U.S. currencies, our financial results are affected by the remeasurement of these non-U.S. currencies into U.S. dollars. We also have foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. While we regularly enter into transactions to hedge foreign currency risk for portions of our foreign currency translation and balance sheet exposure, it is impossible to predict or eliminate the effects of this exposure. Any factors that reduce cross-border trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business. Cross-border trade (i.e., transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries) is an important source of our revenue and profits. Cross-border transactions generally provide higher revenues and operating income than similar transactions that take place within a single country or market. Cross-border trade also represents our primary (and in some cases, our only) presence in certain important markets.Cross-border trade is subject to, and may be negatively impacted by, foreign exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, the interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions (e.g., the jurisdiction of the merchant and of the consumer) are often extremely complicated in the context of cross-border trade. Changes to or the interpretation and/or application of laws and regulations applicable to cross-border trade could impose additional requirements and restrictions, impose conflicting obligations, and increase the costs associated with cross-border trade. Any factors that increase the costs of cross-border trade for us or our customers or that restrict, delay, or make cross-border trade more difficult or impractical, such as trade policy or higher tariffs, could negatively impact our revenues and profits and harm our business. See also the risk factor captioned, “Global and regional economic conditions could harm our business.” 17 Table of Contents Changes in how consumers fund their PayPal transactions could harm our business. We pay transaction fees when consumers fund payment transactions using credit cards, lower fees when consumers fund payments with debit cards, and nominal fees when consumers fund payment transactions by electronic transfer of funds from bank accounts, or from an existing PayPal account balance or through our PayPal branded consumer credit products. Our financial success is sensitive to changes in the rate at which our consumers fund payments using credit and debit cards (collectively, “payment cards”), which can significantly increase our costs. Although we provide consumers with the opportunity to use their existing PayPal account balance to fund payment transactions, some of our consumers may prefer to use payment cards, especially if these payment cards offer features and benefits that are not provided as part of their PayPal accounts. An increase in the portion of our payment volume funded using payment cards or in fees associated with our funding mix, or other events or developments that make it more difficult or costly for us to fund transactions with lower-cost funding options, could materially and adversely affect our financial performance and significantly harm our business. We have entered into strategic partnerships with major payment card networks and/or issuing banks to promote greater consumer choice and make it easier for merchants to accept and consumers to pay with these partners’ credit and/or debt cards and to allow us to gain access to these partners’ tokenization services for in-store point of sale PayPal transactions. These arrangements may have an uncertain impact on our business. While we anticipate that these and similar strategic partnerships we may enter into in the future will result in an increase in the number of transactions and transaction volume that we process, we also anticipate that a greater percentage of customer transactions will be executed using a payment card, which would likely increase the transaction costs associated with our funding mix, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and profitability. The United Kingdom’s departure from the EU could adversely affect us. The United Kingdom (“U.K.”) held a referendum in June 2016 in which a majority of voters approved an exit from the European Union (“EU”) (commonly referred to as “Brexit”). In March 2017, the U.K. government initiated the exit process under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, which commenced a two-year period expiring on March 29, 2019, after which time the U.K. is expected to leave the EU in the absence of any effective extension to the Article 50 period. Political negotiations are underway; however, there is a significant lack of clarity over the terms of the U.K.'s exit from the EU and the terms of the U.K.'s future relationship with the EU. The U.K.'s financial service regulators are implementing Temporary Permission Regimes that are expected to be put in place by the U.K.'s government to support European Economic Area (“EEA”) financial services firms in continuing to conduct business in the U.K. should the U.K. exit the EU without an agreement. Brexit could adversely affect U.K., regional (including European), and worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the British Pound and Euro, which in turn could adversely affect us or our customers and companies with which we do business, particularly in the U.K. Brexit could lead to greater restrictions on the supply and availability of goods and services between the U.K and the EEA region, with the potential inability of U.K. companies to fulfill orders leading in turn to a risk of increased merchant defaults and buyer protection claims. Brexit could also trigger a general deterioration in credit conditions, a downturn in consumer sentiment and overall negative economic growth. Any of these scenarios could have an adverse effect on our business or our customers. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and increased complexity for financial services firms as national laws and regulations in the U.K. start to diverge from EU laws and regulations. In particular, depending on the terms of Brexit, we may face new regulatory costs and challenges, including the following:•if we are unable to utilize appropriate authorizations and regulator permissions, our EU operations could lose their ability to offer services on a cross-border basis into the U.K. market and for our U.K. based operations to offer services on a cross-border basis in the EEA markets. For example, our ability to work primarily with the Luxembourg regulator as the lead authority for various aspects of our U.K. operations may also be impacted;•we could be required to obtain additional regulatory permissions to operate in the U.K. market, adding costs and potential inconsistency to our business (and, depending on the capacity of the U.K. authorities, the criteria for obtaining permission, and any possible transitional arrangements, there is a risk that our business in the U.K. could be materially affected or disrupted); •we could be required to comply with regulatory requirements in the U.K. that are in addition to, or inconsistent with, the regulatory requirements of the EU, leading to increased complexity and costs for our EU and UK operations; and•our ability to attract and retain the necessary human resources in appropriate locations to support the U.K. business and the EU business of PayPal could be adversely impacted.These and other factors related to Brexit could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 18 Table of Contents Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight. Our failure to comply with extensive, complex, overlapping, and frequently changing rules, regulations, and legal interpretations could materially harm our business. Our business is subject to laws, rules, regulations, policies, and legal interpretations in the markets in which we operate, including, but not limited to, those governing: •banking, •credit, •deposit taking, •cross-border and domestic money transmission, •prepaid access, •foreign exchange, •privacy, •data protection, •cybersecurity, •banking secrecy, •payment services (including payment processing and settlement services), •consumer protection, •economic and trade sanctions, •anti-money laundering, and •counter-terrorist financing. Our success and increased visibility may result in increased regulatory oversight and enforcement and more restrictive rules and regulations that apply to our business.As we expand and localize our international activities, we have become increasingly obligated to comply with the laws of the countries or markets in which we operate. In addition, because our services are accessible worldwide and we facilitate sales of goods and provide services to customers worldwide, one or more jurisdictions may claim that we or our customers are required to comply with their laws. Laws regulating the internet, mobile, and related technologies outside of the U.S. often impose different, more specific, or even conflicting obligations on us, as well as broader liability. For example, certain transactions that may be permissible in a local jurisdiction may be prohibited by regulations of U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) or U.S. anti-money laundering or counter-terrorist financing regulations.Any failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or new laws, regulations, or orders of any governmental authority (including changes to or expansion of the interpretation of those laws, regulations, or orders), including those discussed in this risk factor, may subject us to significant fines, penalties, criminal and civil lawsuits, forfeiture of significant assets, and enforcement actions in one or more jurisdictions, result in additional compliance and licensure requirements, increase regulatory scrutiny of our business, restrict our operations, and force us to change our business practices, make product or operational changes, or delay planned product launches or improvements. Any of the foregoing could, individually or in the aggregate, harm our reputation, damage our brands and business, and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The complexity of U.S. federal and state regulatory and enforcement regimes, coupled with the global scope of our operations and the evolving global regulatory environment, could result in a single event giving rise to a large number of overlapping investigations and legal and regulatory proceedings by multiple government authorities in different jurisdictions. We have implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations. 19 Table of Contents Payments Regulation In the U.S., PayPal, Inc. has obtained licenses to operate as a money transmitter (or its equivalent) in the states where such licenses are required, as well as in the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. These licenses include not only the PayPal branded products and services in these states, but also our Braintree, Venmo, and Xoom products and services. We may also maintain such licenses for certain companies that we have recently acquired, such as Hyperwallet. As a licensed money transmitter, PayPal is subject to restrictions with respect to the investment of customer funds, reporting requirements, bonding requirements, and inspection by state regulatory agencies. Accordingly, if we violate these laws or regulations, we could be subject to liability and/or additional restrictions, forced to cease doing business with residents of certain states, forced to change our business practices, or required to obtain additional licenses or regulatory approvals, which could impose substantial costs.While we currently allow our customers with payment cards to send payments from approximately 200 markets, we allow customers in only approximately half of those markets (including the U.S.) to also receive payments, in some cases with significant restrictions on the manner in which customers can withdraw funds. These limitations may adversely affect our ability to grow our business in these markets. We principally provide our services to customers in the EU through PayPal (Europe) S.a.r.l. et Cie., SCA (“PayPal (Europe)”), our wholly-owned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a credit institution in Luxembourg. Accordingly, PayPal (Europe) is subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if it violates the disclosure, reporting, anti-money laundering, capitalization, fund management, corporate governance, privacy, data protection, information security, banking secrecy, taxation, sanctions, or other requirements imposed on Luxembourg banks. In addition, EU laws and regulations are typically subject to different and potentially inconsistent interpretations by the countries that are members of the EU, which can make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage. Moreover, the countries that are EU members may each have different and potentially inconsistent domestic regulations implementing European Directives, including the EU Payment Services Directive and the E-Money Directive, which could make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage. The Revised Payment Services Directive (“PSD2”) entered into force in January 2016 and is in the process of being implemented into national legislation, with certain requirements effective January 13, 2018. However, a number of EU member states have not yet fully implemented PSD2 into domestic legislation. Luxembourg, which is the home member state of PayPal (Europe), implemented PSD2 on July 28, 2018. The implementation of PSD2 may negatively affect our business. PSD2 seeks to enable new payment models whereby a newly formed category of regulated payment provider would be able to access bank and payment accounts (including PayPal accounts) for the purposes of accessing account information or initiating a payment on behalf of a customer. Such access could subject us to data security and other legal and financial risks and could create new competitive forces and new types of competitors in the European payments market. PSD2 seeks to regulate more online platforms that handle payments for their sellers. PayPal merchants with affected business models which are not licensed, or which do not benefit from exemptions or integrate a compliant marketplaces solution may not be able to offer PayPal products in the future. PSD2 also imposes new standards (coming into force on September 14, 2019) for payment security and strong customer authentication that may make it more difficult and time consuming to carry out a PayPal transaction, which may adversely impact PayPal’s customer value proposition and its European business.If the business activities of PayPal (Europe) exceed certain thresholds, or if the European Central Bank (“ECB”) so determines, PayPal (Europe) may be deemed a significant supervised entity such that some activity of PayPal (Europe) could become directly regulated by the ECB rather than the Luxembourg regulator (the “CSSF”), as its national supervisor, which could subject us to additional requirements and would likely increase compliance costs.In many of the other markets outside the U.S. in which we do business, we serve our customers through PayPal Pte. Ltd., our wholly-owned subsidiary based in Singapore. PayPal Pte. Ltd. is supervised by the Monetary Authority of Singapore and designated as a holder of a stored value facility, but does not hold a remittance license. As a result, PayPal Pte. Ltd. is not able to offer outbound remittance payments (including donations to charities) from Singapore, and can only offer payments for the purchase of goods and services in Singapore. In many of the markets (other than Singapore) served by PayPal Pte. Ltd., it is unclear and uncertain whether our Singapore-based service is subject only to Singapore law or, if it is subject to the application of local laws, whether such local laws would require a payment processor like us to be licensed as a payments service, bank, financial institution, or otherwise. Payment services legislation currently pending in Singapore may change how PayPal Pte. Ltd is regulated and, if such legislation is passed, our compliance and operating costs will likely increase. In certain markets outside the U.S. (e.g., Australia), we provide our services to customers through a local subsidiary subject to local regulatory supervision or oversight, which may be the holder of a local payment license, certification, or other authorization. In such markets, we may be subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if we violate applicable reporting, anti-money laundering, capital requirements, privacy, corporation governance, risk management, or any other applicable requirements. We have been, and expect to continue to be, required to apply for various licenses, certifications, and regulatory approvals in a number of the jurisdictions where we provide our services, including due to changes in applicable laws and regulations or the interpretation of such laws and regulations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to (or decide to) obtain any such licenses, certifications, and approvals. In addition, there are substantial costs and potential product changes involved in maintaining and renewing such licenses, certifications, and approvals, and we could be subject to fines or other enforcement action if we are found to violate disclosure, reporting, anti-money laundering, capitalization, corporate governance, or other requirements of such licenses. These factors could impose substantial additional costs, involve considerable delay to the development or provision of our products or services, require significant and costly operational changes, or prevent us from providing our products or services in a given market.In many countries, it may not be clear whether we are required to be licensed as a payment services provider, bank, financial institution, or otherwise. In such markets, we may rely on local banks to process payments and conduct foreign exchange transactions in local currency. Local regulators may use their power to slow or halt payments to local merchants conducted through local banks or otherwise prohibit or impede us from doing business in a jurisdiction. Such regulatory actions or the need to obtain licenses, certifications, or other regulatory approvals could impose substantial costs, involve considerable delay to the provision or development of our services, require significant and costly operational changes, impose restrictions, limitations, or additional requirements on our business, or prevent us from providing any products or services in a given market. 20 Table of Contents Consumer Protection We are subject to consumer protection laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. In the U.S., we are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations applicable to our activities, including the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (“EFTA”) and Regulation E as implemented by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). These regulations require us to provide advance disclosure of changes to our services, follow specified error resolution procedures, and reimburse consumers for losses from certain transactions not authorized by the consumer, among other requirements. Additionally, technical violations of consumer protection laws could result in the assessment of actual damages or statutory damages or penalties of up to $1,000 in individual cases or up to $500,000 per violation in any class action and treble damages in some instances; we could also be liable for plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees in such cases. We are subject to, and have paid amounts in settlement of, lawsuits containing allegations that our business violated the EFTA and Regulation E or otherwise advance claims for relief relating to our business practices (e.g., that we improperly held consumer funds or otherwise improperly limited consumer accounts).In October 2016, the CFPB issued a final rule on prepaid accounts. The rule’s definition of prepaid account includes certain accounts that are capable of being loaded with funds and whose primary function is to conduct transactions with multiple, unaffiliated merchants, at ATMs and/or for person-to-person transfers, including certain digital wallets. The rule’s requirements include: the disclosure of fees and other information to the consumer prior to the creation of a prepaid account; the extension of Regulation E liability limits and error-resolution requirements to all prepaid accounts; the application of Regulation Z credit card requirements to prepaid accounts with overdraft and credit features; and the submission of prepaid account agreements to the CFPB and their publication to the general public. In April 2017, the CFPB delayed the effective date of the final rule on prepaid accounts to April 1, 2018, and indicated that it would review, among other issues, the linking of credit cards to digital wallets that are capable of storing funds. In June 2017, the CFPB released proposed changes to its final rule, and in January 2018, the CFPB issued its final rule, modifying some aspects of the rule, with an overall effective date of April 1, 2019. We are in the process of implementing certain changes to comply with the final rule. We expect that such implementation will require us to make substantial changes to the design of certain U.S. consumer accounts and their operability, which could lead to customer dissatisfaction, require us to reallocate resources, and increase our costs, which could negatively affect our business. In May 2015, we entered into a Stipulated Final Judgment and Consent Order (“Consent Order”) with the CFPB in which we settled regulatory claims arising from PayPal Credit practices between 2011 and 2015. The Consent Order included obligations on PayPal to pay $15 million in redress to consumers and a $10 million civil monetary penalty, and required PayPal to make various changes to PayPal Credit disclosures and related business practices. We continue to cooperate and engage with the CFPB and work to ensure compliance with the Consent Order, which may result in us incurring additional costs.PayPal (Europe) principally offers its services in EU countries through a “passport” notification process through the Luxembourg regulator to regulators in other EU member states pursuant to EU regulations. Regulators in these countries could notify PayPal (Europe) of local consumer protection laws that apply to its business, in addition to Luxembourg consumer protection law, and could also seek to persuade the Luxembourg regulator to order PayPal (Europe) to conduct its or the PayPal group's activities in the local country directly or through a branch office. These or similar actions by these regulators could increase the cost of, or delay, our plans to expand our business in EU countries. 21 Table of Contents Economic and Trade Sanctions We are required to comply with U.S. economic and trade sanctions administered by OFAC and the Council of the European Union, respectively. We have self-reported to OFAC certain transactions that were inadvertently processed but subsequently identified as possible violations of U.S. economic and trade sanctions. In March 2015, we reached a settlement with OFAC regarding possible violations arising from our sanctions compliance practices between 2009 and 2013, prior to the implementation of our real-time transaction scanning program. Subsequently, we have self-reported additional transactions as possible violations, and we have received new subpoenas from OFAC seeking additional information about certain of these transactions. Such self-reported transactions could result in claims or actions against us, including litigation, injunctions, damage awards, fines or penalties, or require us to change our business practices in a manner that could result in a material loss, require significant management time, result in the diversion of significant operational resources, or otherwise harm our business. Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing We are subject to various anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws and regulations around the world that prohibit, among other things, our involvement in transferring the proceeds of criminal activities. Regulators in the U.S. and other regulators globally continue to increase their scrutiny of compliance with these obligations, which may require us to further revise or expand our compliance program, including the procedures we use to verify the identity of our customers and to monitor international and domestic transactions. Many countries in which we operate also have anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws and regulations, and we have been and will continue to be required to make changes to our compliance program in various jurisdictions in response. Regulators regularly re-examine the transaction volume thresholds at which we must obtain and keep applicable records or verify identities of customers and any change in such thresholds could result in greater costs for compliance. In the EU, the implementation of the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive and the regulation on information accompanying transfer of funds (commonly known as the Revised Wire Transfer Regulation) may make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage, lead to increased friction for customers, and result in a decrease in business. Penalties for non-compliance with the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive could include fines of up to 10% of PayPal (Europe)’s total annual turnover. On April 19, 2018, the European Parliament adopted the European Commission’s proposal for a Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive, containing more stringent provisions in certain areas, which may also increase compliance costs. Privacy and Protection of User Data We are subject to a number of laws, rules, directives, and regulations (which we refer to as “privacy laws”) relating to the collection, use, retention, security, processing, and transfer (which we refer to as “process”) of personally identifiable information about our customers and employees (which we refer to as “personal data”) in the countries where we operate. Our business relies on the processing of data in many jurisdictions and the movement of data across national borders. As a result, much of the personal data that we process, especially financial information, is regulated by multiple privacy laws and, in some cases, the privacy laws of multiple jurisdictions. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between or among us, our subsidiaries, and other parties with which we have commercial relationships.Regulatory scrutiny of privacy, data protection, and the collection, storage, use, and sharing of personal data is increasing around the world. There is uncertainty associated with the legal and regulatory environment relating to privacy and data protection laws, which continue to develop in ways we cannot predict, including with respect to evolving technologies such as cloud computing and blockchain technology. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our privacy policies and communicated to users prior to our collection, use, storage and transfer, and disclosure of their personal data, with applicable industry data protection or security standards, with any applicable regulatory requirements or orders, or with privacy, data protection, information security, or consumer protection-related laws and regulations in one or more jurisdictions could result in proceedings or actions against us by data protection authorities (which we refer to as “supervisory authorities”), governmental entities or others, including class action privacy litigation in certain jurisdictions, would subject us to significant awards, fines, penalties, judgments, and negative publicity arising from any financial or non-financial damages suffered by any individuals. This could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business. Specifically, this would likely require us to change our business practices, and would increase the costs and complexity of compliance. In addition, compliance with inconsistent privacy laws may restrict our ability to provide products and services to our customers.PayPal relies on a variety of compliance methods to transfer personal data of EU citizens to the U.S., including reliance on Binding Corporate Rules (“BCRs”) for internal transfers of certain types of personal data and Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”) as approved by the European Commission for transfers to and from third parties. PayPal must also ensure that third parties processing personal data of PayPal’s EU customers and/or employees outside of the EU have compliant transfer mechanisms. In October 2015, the European Court of Justice invalidated U.S.-EU Safe Harbor framework clauses that were previously relied upon by some PayPal vendors to lawfully transfer personal data of EU citizens to U.S. companies, and PayPal entered into SCCs with those third parties who had previously relied on the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor framework. In July 2016, the U.S. and EU authorities agreed on a replacement for Safe Harbor known as “Privacy Shield.” Both the Privacy Shield framework and SCCs are facing legal challenges in the European justice system. To the extent that the Privacy Shield or SCCs are invalidated, PayPal’s ability to process EU personal data with third parties outside of the EU could be jeopardized.In 2016, the EU adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective in May 2018. The EU data protection regime expands the scope of the EU data protection law to all foreign companies processing personal data of EU residents, imposes a strict data protection compliance regime with severe penalties of up to the greater of 4% of worldwide turnover or €20 million, and includes new rights such as the “portability” of personal data. Although the GDPR applies across the EU without a need for local implementing legislation, each EU member state has the ability to interpret the GDPR opening clauses, which permit region-specific data protection legislation and have the potential to create inconsistencies on a country-by-country basis. Implementation of the GDPR has required us to change our business practices and increased the costs and complexity of compliance.PayPal also faces additional potential challenges from local data protection agencies (“DPAs”). Because PayPal (Europe) is headquartered in Luxembourg and subject to regulation as a bank in that jurisdiction, we have relied on the “one-stop-shop” concept under which Luxembourg has been our lead data protection regulator in the EU. However, a 2015 European Court of Justice ruling (Weltimmo) affecting companies that do business in the EU potentially could make us subject to the local data protection laws or regulatory enforcement activities of the various EU member states in which we have established legal entities and which apply privacy laws that are different than, and may conflict with, Luxembourg privacy laws.In addition, because of the large number of text messages, emails, phone calls, and other communications we send or make to our customers for various business purposes, communication-related privacy laws that provide a specified monetary damage award or fine for each violation could result in particularly significant damage awards or fines. For example, under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”), in the U.S., plaintiffs may seek actual monetary loss or statutory damages of $500 per violation, whichever is greater, and courts may triple the damage award for willful or knowing violations. We have been, and may continue to be subject to lawsuits (including class-action lawsuits) containing allegations that our business violated the TCPA. These lawsuits seek damages (including statutory damages) and injunctive relief, among other remedies. Given the large number of communications we send to our customers, a determination that there have been violations of the TCPA or other communications-based statutes could expose us to significant damage awards that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business. 22 Table of Contents If one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their financial or performance obligations to us or fail, we may incur significant losses. We have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents, and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the U.S. and abroad. As part of our currency hedging activities, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments with various financial institutions. Certain banks and financial institutions are also lenders under our credit facilities. We regularly monitor our exposure to counterparty credit risk, and actively manage this exposure to mitigate the associated risk. Despite these efforts, we may be exposed to the risk of default by, or deteriorating operating results or financial condition or failure of, these counterparty financial institutions. The risk of counterparty default, deterioration, or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets. If one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or to access or recover our assets that are deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty’s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties, we could incur significant losses, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. 23 Table of Contents PayPal is not a bank or licensed lender in the U.S. and relies upon third parties to make loans and provide other products critical to our business, which raises additional risks. As PayPal is neither a chartered financial institution, nor licensed to make loans in any state in the U.S., we rely on third-party chartered financial institutions to provide PayPal branded credit products to our customers in the U.S., including consumer credits products such as PayPal Credit and PayPal branded Mastercard credit cards, and business credit products such as PayPal Working Capital and PayPal Business Loan products. Any termination or interruption in a partner bank’s ability or willingness to lend could interrupt, potentially materially, our ability to offer consumer and business loan products, which could materially and adversely affect our business. In the event of a partner bank’s inability or unwillingness to lend, we may need to reach a similar agreement with another chartered financial institution or obtain our own bank charter or lending licenses. We may be unable to reach a similar agreement with another partner on favorable terms or at all. Obtaining a bank charter or lending licenses would be a costly, time-consuming and uncertain process, and would subject us to additional laws and regulatory requirements, which could be burdensome, increase our costs, and require us to change our business practices. In addition, as a service provider to these bank partners, which are federally supervised U.S. financial institutions, we are subject from time to time to examination by their federal banking regulators.In July 2018, we completed the sale of our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio to Synchrony Bank, for total consideration of $6.9 billion. The purchase price is subject to a post-closing true-up and certain other adjustments under the terms of the purchase agreement. As a part of a separate agreement, PayPal earns a revenue share on the portfolio of consumer receivables owned by Synchrony Bank, which includes both the sold and newly generated receivables and we will not hold an ownership interest in newly generated consumer credit receivables. It may take us longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction, and those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. In addition, our increased reliance on Synchrony Bank subjects us to risks in the nature of those discussed in this “Risk Factors” section under the caption “We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk.” Our ability to receive the benefit of our business finance offerings may be subject to challenge. Business loans under our PayPal Working Capital and PayPal Business Loan products are provided by a state chartered industrial bank under a program agreement with us. We acquire the receivables generated by those loans after they are originated.A case decided in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, Madden v. Midland Funding, LLC (786 F.3d 246 (2d Cir. 2015)), resulted in some uncertainty as to whether non-bank entities purchasing loans originated by a bank may rely on federal preemption of state usury laws, and may create an increased risk of litigation by plaintiffs challenging our ability to collect interest and fees in accordance with the terms of certain loans. Although the decision specifically addressed preemption under the National Bank Act, this decision could support future challenges to federal preemption for other institutions, including FDIC-insured, state chartered industrial banks like the issuing bank of loans under PayPal Working Capital and PayPal Business Loan products. After the Madden decision, there continue to be a number of U.S. state and federal court legal actions challenging the viability of business models where a non-bank entity enters into a relationship with a third-party chartered financial institution for the issuance of credit products. While we believe the manner in which PayPal branded credit products are offered can be distinguished from Madden, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of any potential litigation, and an adverse determination could materially and adversely impact our PayPal Working Capital and PayPal Business Loan products and our business. Some of our credit products expose us to additional risks. We offer our PayPal Credit consumer product and our PayPal Working Capital and PayPal Business Loan products to a wide range of consumers and merchants in various markets, and the financial success of these products depends on the effective management of related risk. The credit decisioning process for the PayPal Credit consumer product in markets outside the U.S. uses proprietary segmentation and credit algorithms and other analytical techniques designed to analyze the credit risk of specific consumers based on, among other factors, their past purchasing and payment history with PayPal as well as their credit scores. Similarly, proprietary risk models and other indicators are applied to assess merchants who wish to use our business finance offerings to help predict their ability to repay. These risk models may not accurately predict the creditworthiness of a consumer or merchant due to factors such as inaccurate assumptions, including assumptions related to the particular consumer or merchant, market conditions, economic environment, or limited transaction history or other data, among other factors. The accuracy of these risk models and the ability to manage credit risk related to our credit products may also be affected by legal or regulatory requirements, competitors’ actions, changes in consumer behavior, changes in the economic environment, and other factors. Our international expansion of our credit product offerings also exposes us to additional risks, including those discussed in the risk factor captioned “Our international operations subject us to increased risks, which could harm our business.”Like other businesses with significant exposure to losses from merchant credit, we face the risk that account holders will default on their payment obligations, creating the risk of potential charge-offs. We face similar risks with respect to U.S. consumer credit losses through the profit sharing relationship with Synchrony Bank. The non-payment rate among account holders may increase due to, among other things, changes to underwriting standards, worsening economic conditions, such as a recession or government austerity programs, increases in prevailing interest rates, and high unemployment rates. Account holders who miss payments often fail to repay their loans, and account holders who file for protection under the bankruptcy laws generally do not repay their loans.We currently purchase receivables related to the PayPal branded merchant credit products in the U.S. If we are unable to fund our purchase of these receivables adequately or in a cost-effective manner, or if we are unable to efficiently manage the cash resources utilized for these purposes, our business could be harmed. 24 Table of Contents Catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business War, terrorism, political events, geopolitical instability, trade barriers and restrictions, public health issues, natural disasters, or other catastrophic events have caused and could cause damage or disruption to the economy and commerce on a global, regional or country-specific basis, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, our customers, and companies with which we do business. Such events could decrease demand for our products and services or make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products and services to our customers. Our corporate headquarters are located in the Silicon Valley, which is a seismically active region in California. Our business operations are subject to interruption by, among others, natural disasters, fire, power shortages, earthquakes, floods, nuclear power plant accidents, and events beyond our control such as other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes and public health issues. A catastrophic event that results in a disruption or failure of our systems or operations could result in significant losses and require substantial recovery time and significant expenditures in order to resume or maintain operations, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Changes to our buyer and seller protection programs could increase our loss rate. Our buyer and seller protection programs protect merchants and consumers from fraudulent transactions, and consumers if they do not receive the item ordered or if the item received is significantly different from its description. In addition, consumers who pay through PayPal may have reimbursement rights from their payment card issuer (usually a bank), which in turn will seek recovery from us. The risk of losses from our buyer and seller protection programs are specific to individual buyers, sellers, and transactions, and may also be impacted by regional variations to these programs, modifications to these programs resulting from changes in regulatory requirements, or changes that we decide to implement, such as expanding the scope of transactions covered by one or more of these programs. Increases in our loss rate, including as a result of changing our buyer and seller protection programs, could harm our business. Our international operations subject us to increased risks, which could harm our business. Our international operations have generated approximately one-half of our net revenues in recent years. There are risks inherent in doing business internationally on both a domestic (i.e., in-country) and cross-border basis, including, but not limited to:•foreign currency and cross-border trade risks discussed earlier in this “Risk Factors” section under the captions “We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates” and “Any factors that reduce cross-border trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business”;•risks related to other government regulation or required compliance with local laws;•local licensing and reporting obligations;•obligations to comply with local regulatory and legal obligations related to privacy, data security, and data localization; •expenses associated with localizing our products and services, including offering customers the ability to transact business in the local currency, and adapting our products and services to local preferences (e.g., payment methods) with which we may have limited or no experience;•trade barriers and changes in trade regulations;•difficulties in developing, staffing, and simultaneously managing a large number of varying foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences;•stringent local labor laws and regulations;•credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;•profit repatriation restrictions, foreign currency exchange restrictions, or extreme fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for a particular currency;•political or social unrest, economic instability, repression, or human rights issues;•geopolitical events, including natural disasters, public health issues, acts of war, and terrorism;•import or export regulations;•compliance with U.S. laws and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, and other local anticorruption laws;•compliance with U.S. and foreign laws designed to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities;•antitrust and competition regulations;•potentially adverse tax developments and consequences;•economic uncertainties relating to sovereign and other debt;•national or regional differences in macroeconomic growth rates;•different, uncertain, overlapping, or more stringent user protection, data protection, privacy, and other laws and regulations; and•increased difficulties in collecting accounts receivable.Violations of the complex foreign and U.S. laws, rules and regulations that apply to our international operations may result in fines, criminal actions, or sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies. These risks are inherent in our international operations and expansion, may increase our costs of doing business internationally, and could harm our business. 25 Table of Contents We are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates. We are exposed to interest rate risk from our investment portfolio and from interest-rate sensitive assets, including assets underlying the customer balances we hold on our balance sheet as customer accounts. A low interest rate environment or reductions in interest rates may negatively impact our investment income and our net income. In addition, fluctuations in interest rates may adversely impact our customers’ spending levels and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amounts owed to us. Higher interest rates often lead to higher payment obligations by customers to us and other lenders under mortgage, credit card, and other consumer and merchant loans, which may reduce our customers’ ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore lead to increased delinquencies, charge-offs, and allowance for loan and interest receivable which could have an adverse effect on our net income.We have entered into a revolving credit facility and a 364-day delayed-draw term loan credit facility. We have borrowed under these credit facilities from time to time, and any borrowings under these credit facilities bear interest at a floating rate, exposing us to interest rate fluctuations. Use of our payments services for illegal purposes could harm our business. Our payment system is susceptible to potentially illegal or improper uses, including money laundering, terrorist financing, illegal online gambling, fraudulent sales of goods or services, illegal sales of prescription medications or controlled substances, piracy of software, movies, music, and other copyrighted or trademarked goods (in particular, digital goods), bank fraud, child pornography human trafficking, prohibited sales of alcoholic beverages or tobacco products, securities fraud, pyramid or ponzi schemes, or to facilitate other illegal activity. Use of our payment system for illegal or improper uses has subjected us, and may subject us in the future, to claims, individual and class action lawsuits, and government and regulatory investigations, inquiries, or requests that could result in liability and reputational harm for us. Moreover, certain activity that may be legal in one jurisdiction may be illegal in another jurisdiction, and a merchant may intentionally or inadvertently be found responsible for importing or exporting illegal goods, resulting in liability for us. Changes in law have increased the penalties for intermediaries providing payment services for certain illegal activities, and government authorities may consider additional payments-related proposals from time to time. Owners of intellectual property rights or government authorities may seek to bring legal action against providers of payments solutions, including PayPal, that are peripherally involved in the sale of infringing or allegedly infringing items. Any threatened or resulting claims could result in reputational harm, and any resulting liabilities, loss of transaction volume, or increased costs could harm our business. 26 Table of Contents Our failure to manage our customer funds and the assets underlying our customer funds properly could harm our business. We hold a substantial amount of funds belonging to our customers, including balances in customer accounts and funds being remitted to sellers of goods and services or recipients of person to person (“P2P”) transactions. In certain jurisdictions where we operate, we are required to hold eligible liquid assets, as defined by the relevant regulators in each jurisdiction, equal to at least 100% of the aggregate amount of all customer balances. Our ability to manage and account accurately for the assets underlying our customer funds and comply with applicable liquid asset requirements requires a high level of internal controls. As our business continues to grow and we expand our product offerings, we must continue to strengthen our associated internal controls. PayPal (Europe), with the permission of the CSSF, utilizes certain European customer balances held by our Luxembourg banking subsidiary to fund credit balances relating to certain customers. Our success requires significant public confidence in our ability to properly manage our customers’ balances and handle large and growing transaction volumes and amounts of customer funds. Any failure to maintain the necessary controls or to manage our customer funds and the assets underlying our customer funds accurately and in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements could result in reputational harm, lead customers to discontinue or reduce their use of our products and result in significant penalties and fines, which could materially harm our business. We are subject to regulatory activity and antitrust litigation under competition laws. We are subject to scrutiny by various government agencies under U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including antitrust and competition laws. An increasing number of governments are actively enforcing competition laws and regulations. Some jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to assert claims of anticompetitive conduct. Other companies and government agencies have in the past and may in the future allege that our actions violate the antitrust or competition laws of the U.S., individual states, other countries, or the European Commission, or otherwise constitute unfair competition. Our business agreements or arrangements with customers or other companies could give rise to regulatory action or antitrust litigation. Some regulators, particularly those outside of the U.S., may perceive that our products and services are used so broadly that otherwise uncontroversial business practices could be deemed anticompetitive. Any claims or investigations, even if without merit, may be very expensive to defend or respond to, involve negative publicity, and substantial diversion of management time and effort, and could result in reputational harm, significant judgments, fines or remedial actions against us, or require us to change our business practices. We are subject to patent litigation. We have been sued repeatedly for allegedly infringing other parties’ patents. At any given time, we are typically a defendant in a number of patent lawsuits. We expect that we will continue to be subject to patent infringement claims because, among other reasons:•our products and services continue to expand in scope and complexity and to converge with technologies not previously associated with the payments space;•we continue to expand into new business areas, including through acquisitions; and•the number of patent owners who may claim that we, any of the companies that we have acquired, or our customers infringe their patents, and the aggregate number of patents controlled by such patent owners, continues to increase.Such claims may be brought directly against us or against our users whom we may indemnify because we are contractually obligated to do so or we choose to do so as a business matter. We believe that many of the claims against us and other technology companies have been, and continue to be, initiated by third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims. In addition, we have seen significant patent disputes between operating companies in some technology industries. Patent claims, whether meritorious or not, are time-consuming and costly to manage, defend, and resolve, and could require us to make expensive changes in our methods of doing business, enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements, make substantial payments to satisfy adverse judgments or settle claims or proceedings, or cease conducting certain operations, which would harm our business. We may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or third parties may allege that we are infringing their intellectual property rights. The protection of our intellectual property, including our trademarks, patents, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, and trade secrets, is important to the success of our business. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on applicable laws and regulations in the U.S. and internationally, as well as a variety of administrative procedures. We also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights when offering or procuring products and services, including confidentiality and invention assignment agreements entered into with our employees and contractors and confidentiality agreements with parties with whom we conduct business.Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we offer our products and services. We may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our rights. Although we have generally taken measures to protect our intellectual property rights, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in protecting or enforcing our rights in every jurisdiction, or that contractual arrangements and other steps that we have taken to protect our intellectual property will prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our intellectual property or deter independent development of equivalent or superior intellectual property rights by others. If we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting, registering, or using trademarks and trade dress that infringe, dilute, or otherwise violate our trademark rights, the value of our brands could be diminished and our business could be adversely affected. Also, we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. We have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to others. These licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation. Any failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or significant costs incurred in doing so, could diminish the value of our intangible assets and materially harm our business.As the number of products in the technology and payments industries increases and the functionality of these products further overlaps, and as we acquire technology through acquisitions or licenses, we may become increasingly subject to intellectual property infringement and other claims. Litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of the patent and other intellectual property rights of others. The ultimate outcome of any allegation is often uncertain and, regardless of the outcome, any such claim, with or without merit, may be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert management’s time and attention from our business, and require us to, among other things, redesign or stop providing our products or services, pay substantial amounts to satisfy judgments or settle claims or lawsuits, pay substantial royalty or licensing fees, or satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with certain parties with whom we have commercial relationships. Our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights, or litigation or claims arising out of intellectual property matters, may harm or restrict our business. 27 Table of Contents We are regularly subject to general litigation, regulatory actions, and government inquiries. We are regularly subject to claims, individual and class action lawsuits, government and regulatory investigations, inquiries, actions or requests, and other proceedings alleging violations of laws, rules and regulations with respect to competition, antitrust, intellectual property, privacy, data protection, information security, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, sanctions, anti-corruption, consumer protection, fraud, accessibility, securities, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, services, charitable fundraising, contract disputes, escheatment of unclaimed or abandoned property, those matters described in Note 13—“Commitments and Contingencies—Litigation and Regulatory Matters—General Matters” to our consolidated financial statements, and other matters. In particular, our business faces ongoing consumer protection and intellectual property litigation, as discussed above. The number and significance of these disputes and inquiries may increase as our business expands in scale, scope and geographic reach, and our products and services increase in scale and complexity. In addition, the laws, rules and regulations affecting our business, including those pertaining to internet and mobile commerce, data protection, payments services, and credit, are subject to ongoing interpretation by the courts and governmental authorities, and the resulting uncertainty in the scope and application of these laws, rules, and regulations increases the risk that we will be subject to private claims and governmental actions alleging violations. The scope, outcome, and impact of claims, lawsuits, government investigations, disputes, and proceedings to which we are subject cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of the outcome, such matters can have an adverse impact, which may be material, on our business, results of operations, or financial condition because of legal costs, diversion of management resources, reputational damage, and other factors. Determining reserves for our pending litigation and regulatory proceedings is a complex, fact-intensive process that involves a high degree of judgment. Resolving one or more of such legal and regulatory proceedings or other matters could potentially require us to make substantial payments to satisfy judgments, fines, or penalties or to settle claims or proceedings, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. These proceedings could also result in reputational harm, criminal sanctions, consent decrees, or orders that prevent us from offering certain products or services, require us to change our business practices in costly ways, or develop non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies. Any of these consequences could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.While certain of our customer agreements contain arbitration provisions with class action waiver provisions that may limit our exposure to consumer class action litigation, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in enforcing these arbitration provisions, including the class action waiver provisions, in the future or in any given case. Legislative, administrative, or regulatory developments may directly or indirectly prohibit or limit the use of pre-dispute arbitration clauses and class action waiver provisions. Any such prohibitions or limitations on or discontinuation of the use of, such arbitration or class action waiver provisions could subject us to additional lawsuits, including additional consumer class action litigation, and significantly limit our ability to avoid exposure from consumer class action litigation. 28 Table of Contents Changes in U.S. tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations, and financial conditions. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive Federal tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act made changes to the corporate tax rate, business-related deductions, and taxation of foreign earnings, among others, that are generally effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. Throughout calendar year 2018, the U.S. Treasury and certain states issued proposed and final legislation and clarifying guidance with respect to the various provisions of the Tax Act. Additional legislation and guidance is expected to be issued in 2019, which could have a material adverse impact on the value of our U.S. deferred tax assets, result in significant changes to currently computed income tax liabilities for past and current tax periods, and increase our future U.S. tax expense. We are continuing to evaluate the Tax Act and its requirements, as well as its application to our business and its impact on our effective tax rate. At this stage, it is unclear how many U.S. states will continue to incorporate these federal law changes, or portions thereof, into their tax codes. The implementation by us of new practices and processes designed to comply with, and benefit from, the Tax Act and its rules and regulations could require us to make substantial changes to our business practices, allocate additional resources, and increase our costs, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities. The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation and significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, compliance with the Tax Act may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the Company, the use of estimates in our financial statements, and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions.Like many other multinational corporations, we are subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Our determination of our tax liability is always subject to audit and review by applicable domestic and foreign authorities, and we are currently undergoing a number of investigations, audits, and reviews by authorities throughout the world. Any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could have a negative effect on our business, and the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the periods for which such determination is made. While we have established reserves based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventualities, these reserves may prove to be insufficient.In addition, our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated, or by the incurrence of losses, in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, as a result of gains on our foreign exchange risk management program; or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items.Various levels of government, such as U.S. federal and state legislatures, and international organizations, such as the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) and the EU, are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative or regulatory action to increase tax revenue. Any such tax reform or other legislative or regulatory actions could increase our effective tax rate. 29 Table of Contents We and our merchants may be subject to sales reporting and record-keeping obligations. A number of U.S. states, the U.S. federal government and foreign countries have implemented or are in the process of implementing reporting or record-keeping obligations on companies that engage in or facilitate ecommerce to improve tax compliance. Additionally, a number of jurisdictions are reviewing whether payment service providers and other intermediaries could be deemed to be the legal agent of merchants for certain tax purposes. We have modified our systems to meet known requirements and expect further modifications will be required to comply with future requirements, which may negatively impact our customer experience and increase operational costs. Any failure by us to comply with these and similar reporting and record-keeping obligations could result in substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions, adversely impact our ability to do business in certain jurisdictions, and harm our business. In addition, in June 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. that states may collect internet sales tax on online purchases made outside of the state, which could adversely affect some of our merchants and indirectly harm our customers. Acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic investments, and other strategic transactions could result in operating difficulties and could harm our business. Acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic investments, and other strategic transactions are important elements of our overall corporate strategy. We expect to continue to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions as part of our overall business strategy, including business combinations, acquisitions, and dispositions of certain businesses, technologies, services, products, and other assets, as well as joint ventures, strategic investments, and commercial and strategic partnerships. These transactions may involve significant challenges, uncertainties and risks, including:•the potential loss of key customers, vendors, and other key business partners of the companies we acquire, or dispose of, following and continuing after announcement of our transaction plans;•difficulty making strategic hires of new employees, declining employee morale, and retention issues affecting employees (particularly the potential loss of key personnel) of companies that we acquire or dispose of, which may result from changes in compensation, management, reporting relationships, future prospects, or the direction of the acquired or disposed business;•diversion of management time and focus;•inability to realize synergies expected to result from an acquisition;•the need to and difficulty of integrating the operations, systems (including accounting, compliance, management, information, human resource, and other administrative systems), technologies, data assets, products, and personnel of each acquired company, which is an inherently risky and potentially lengthy and costly process;•the need to and difficulty of implementing and/or enhancing controls, procedures, and policies appropriate for a larger public company at acquired companies which, prior to the acquisition, may have lacked such controls, procedures, and policies or whose controls, procedures, and policies did not meet applicable legal and regulatory standards;•the inefficiencies and lack of control that may result if integration of acquired companies is delayed or not implemented, and unforeseen difficulties and costs that may arise as a result;•potential exposure to new or increased regulatory oversight and regulatory obligations associated with new products and services or entry into new markets;•risks associated with our expansion into new international markets;•unidentified issues discovered in our due diligence process, including product or service quality issues, intellectual property issues, and legal contingencies;•risks associated with the complexity of entering into and effectively managing joint ventures, strategic investments, and other strategic partnerships;•risks associated with undetected cyberattacks or security breaches at companies that we acquire or with which we may combine or partner;•lawsuits or regulatory actions resulting from the transaction;•liability for activities or conduct of the acquired company before the acquisition, including legal and regulatory claims or disputes, violations of laws and regulations, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities;•the acquisition of new customer and employee personal information, which in and of itself may require regulatory approval and/or additional controls, policies, and procedures, and subject us to additional exposure and additional complexity and costs of compliance; and•our dependence on the accounting, financial reporting, operating metrics and similar systems, controls and processes of acquired businesses, and the risk that errors or irregularities in those systems, controls, and processes will lead to errors in our financial statements or make it more difficult to manage the acquired business.At any given time, we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more of these or other types of transactions, any of which could, individually or in the aggregate, be material to our financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying, negotiating, and consummating favorable transaction opportunities. It may take us longer than expected to fully realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions, and those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Any acquisitions or dispositions may also require us to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt (and increased interest expense), recognize liabilities, and record amortization expenses related to intangible assets or write-offs of goodwill or intangibles, which could dilute the economic and voting rights of our stockholders and adversely affect our results of operations and the interests of holders of our indebtedness, as applicable.We completed our acquisition of iZettle AB (publ) (“iZettle”) on September 20, 2018. Prior to the closing of the acquisition, the UK Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”) initiated a review of the transaction. On December 5, 2018, the CMA referred the acquisition for a Phase 2 investigation and on December 24, 2018, directed PayPal to appoint a monitoring trustee. The deadline for the final decision is May 21, 2019. PayPal is working cooperatively with the CMA and has agreed to hold parts of the PayPal and iZettle businesses separate as agreed with the CMA, pending completion of the CMA’s investigation. Our ability to successfully and timely integrate iZettle’s business and operations with ours and realize the potential synergies and anticipated benefits from the acquisition is subject to the timing and possible outcome of the CMA’s review. The CMA has broad discretion and may impose requirements, limitations or costs, mandate remedies, such as divestitures of certain business assets, or place additional restrictions on the conduct of our businesses, to ensure sufficient competition in the U.K. market. No assurance can be given as to the ultimate impact and outcome of the CMA review, that approval from the CMA will be obtained, or the terms and conditions of such approval.Because acquisitions are inherently risky, our transactions may not be successful and may, in some cases, harm our operating results or financial condition. Any acquisitions or dispositions may also require us to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt (and increased interest expense), recognize liabilities, and record amortization expenses related to intangible assets or impairment of goodwill or intangibles, which could dilute the economic and voting rights of our stockholders and adversely affect our results of operations and the interests of holders of our indebtedness, as applicable.Joint ventures and minority investments inherently involve a lesser degree of influence over business operations, thereby potentially increasing the financial, legal, operational, and/or compliance risks associated with the joint venture or minority investment. In addition, we may be dependent on joint venture partners, controlling shareholders, management or other persons or entities who control them and who may have business interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours. Business decisions or other actions or omissions of the joint venture partners, controlling shareholders, management or other persons or entities who control joint ventures or companies in which we invest may adversely affect the value of our investment, result in litigation or regulatory action against us, and otherwise damage our reputation and brand. 30 Table of Contents There are risks associated with our indebtedness. We have incurred indebtedness, and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations and generate sufficient cash flows to service such debt. In addition, changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity securities and increase our borrowing costs. If our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, the interest rate payable by us under out indebtedness may increase. In addition, any downgrades to our credit ratings may affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and may affect the terms of any such financing. Any of these factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk. We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, including the following:•networks, banks, payment processors, and payment gateways that link us to the payment card and bank clearing networks to process transactions;•unaffiliated third-party lenders to originate the U.S. PayPal Credit and PayPal Mastercard consumer credit products, PayPal Working Capital, and PayPal Business Loan products;•third parties that provide loan servicing and customer statements processing;•third parties that provide certain outsourced customer support and product development functions, which are critical to our operations; and•third parties that provide facilities, infrastructure, components, and services, including data center facilities and cloud computing.Because we rely on third parties to provide certain of our services and to facilitate certain of our business activities, we face increased operational risk. These third parties may be subject to financial, legal, regulatory, and labor issues, cybersecurity incidents, privacy breaches, service terminations, disruptions or interruptions, or other problems, which may impose additional costs or requirements on us or prevent these third parties from providing services to us or our customers on our behalf, which could harm our business. In addition, these third parties may breach their agreements with us, disagree with our interpretation of contract terms or applicable laws and regulations, refuse to continue or renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms or at all, fail or refuse to process transactions or provide other services adequately, take actions that degrade the functionality of our services, impose additional costs or requirements on us or our customers, or give preferential treatment to competitive services. There can be no assurance that third parties who provide services directly to us or our customers on our behalf will continue to do so on acceptable terms, or at all. If any third parties do not adequately or appropriately provide their services or perform their responsibilities to us or our customers on our behalf, we may be unable to procure alternatives from other third parties in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all, and we may be subject to business disruptions, losses or costs to remediate any of the deficiencies, customer dissatisfaction, reputational damage, legal or regulatory proceedings, or other adverse consequences which could harm our business. 31 Table of Contents Our retail point of sale solutions expose us to additional risks. We have announced several retail point of sale solutions, which enable merchants to accept payments using a payments card reader attached to, or otherwise communicating with, a mobile device or to scan payment cards and codes using the mobile device’s embedded camera, and which enable consumers to use their mobile devices to pay at the point of sale. We have entered into strategic partnerships with major payment card networks to further expand our relationship in a way that will make it easier for merchants to accept and consumers to choose to pay for transactions utilizing credit and debit cards via PayPal at the point of sale. Those agreements provide us with access to each of these partner's tokenization services in the U.S. for in-store point-of-sale PayPal transactions, which we expect will increase the number of point of sale transactions that we process. We believe that our recent acquisition of iZettle will enable us to further expand our in-store presence. As we continue to expand our product and service offerings at the retail point of sale, we will face additional risks, including:•increased expectations from offline retailers regarding the reliability and availability of our systems and services and correspondingly lower amounts of downtime, which we may not be able to meet;•significant competition at the retail point of sale, particularly from established payment card providers, many of which have substantially greater resources than we do;•increased targeting by fraudsters; given that our fraud models are less developed in this area, we may experience increases in fraud and associated transaction losses as we adjust to fraudulent activity at the point of sale;•exposure to product liability claims to the extent that hardware devices that we produce for use at the retail point of sale malfunction or are not in compliance with laws, which could result in substantial liability and require product recalls or other actions;•exposure to additional laws, rules, and regulations;•increased reliance on third parties involved with processing in-store payments, including independent software providers, electronic point of sale providers, hardware providers (such as cash register and pin-pad providers), payment processors, and banks that enable in-store transactions; and•lower operating income than our other payment solutions.Unless we are able to successfully manage these risks, including driving adoption of, and significant volume through, our retail point of sale solutions over time, our business may be harmed. 32 Table of Contents Our success largely depends on key personnel. Because competition for our key employees is intense, we may not be able to attract, retain, and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our business. The loss of key personnel could harm our ability to maintain and grow our business. Our future success and performance are significantly dependent upon the continued services of key personnel, including our executive team and other highly skilled employees, and our ability to attract, retain, and motivate such personnel. Competition for key personnel is intense, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area, where our corporate headquarters are located and where the cost of living is high, and we may be unable to successfully attract, integrate, or retain sufficiently qualified key personnel. In making employment decisions, particularly in the technology and payments industries, job candidates often consider the value of the equity awards they would receive in connection with their employment, and our stock price volatility, or a perception that the market price of our stock may not increase or may increase more slowly than stock prices at other technology or payments companies, may make it more difficult to attract, retain, and motivate employees. We may be limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws or policies. Potential changes in U.S. immigration policy may make it difficult to renew or obtain visas for any highly skilled personnel that we have hired or are actively recruiting. Negative sentiments towards the U.S. as a result of these potential changes may also adversely affect our international recruiting efforts. Furthermore, legislative or administrative changes to immigration or visa laws and regulations may impair our hiring processes or projects involving personnel who are not citizens of the country where the work is to be performed. In addition, we do not have long-term employment agreements with any of our key personnel and do not maintain any “key person” life insurance policies. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel, or if we are not able to attract or retain highly qualified key personnel effectively, could harm our business and growth prospects. We are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our products and services. Companies providing online services may be subject to claims relating to information disseminated through them, including claims alleging defamation, libel, harassment, hate speech, breach of contract, invasion of privacy, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through the services, among other things. The laws relating to the liability of companies providing online services for information disseminated through their services are subject to frequent challenges. We are also subject to potential liability to third parties for the customer-provided content on our products and services, particularly in jurisdictions outside the U.S. where the applicable laws are unsettled. If we become liable for information provided by our customers and carried on our products and services, we could be directly harmed and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability, including expending substantial resources or discontinuing certain product or service offerings, which could harm our business. Risks Related to Our Separation from eBay If the distribution, together with certain related transactions, does not qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), eBay, PayPal and eBay stockholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities. On July 17, 2015, we became an independent publicly traded company through the pro rata distribution by eBay Inc. of 100% of our outstanding common stock to eBay’s stockholders (which we sometimes refer to as the “separation” or the “distribution”). eBay received an opinion from its outside legal counsel regarding the qualification of the distribution, together with certain related transactions, as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code. The opinion was based on and relied on, among other things, certain facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements, and undertakings of eBay and of us, including those relating to the past and future conduct of eBay and of us. If any of these representations, statements, or undertakings were, or became, inaccurate or incomplete, or if eBay or we breach any of our respective covenants in the separation documents, the opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized.Notwithstanding the opinion of counsel, the IRS could determine that the distribution, together with certain related transactions, should be treated as a taxable transaction if the IRS determines that any of these representations, assumptions, or undertakings upon which such opinion was based are incorrect or have been violated or if the IRS disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel. An opinion of counsel is not binding on the IRS or any court and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge the conclusions reached in the opinion. The IRS did not provide any opinion in advance of the separation that our proposed transaction is tax-free.If the distribution, together with certain related transactions, failed to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code, in general, eBay would recognize taxable gain as if it had sold the PayPal common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value, eBay stockholders who received PayPal common stock in the distribution may be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares, and we could incur significant liabilities. 33 Table of Contents There are risks associated with our relationship with eBay. In connection with our separation from eBay, we entered into a separation and distribution agreement with eBay, as well as various other agreements, including an operating agreement, a tax matters agreement, an employee matters agreement, an intellectual property matters agreement, a data sharing addendum, and a product development agreement. The separation agreement, the tax matters agreement, the employee matters agreement, and the intellectual property matters agreement determined the allocation of assets and liabilities (including by means of licensing) between the companies following the separation for those respective areas and include associated indemnification obligations. The operating agreement, the data sharing addendum, and the product development agreement establish certain commercial relationships between eBay and us related to payment processing, credit, and data sharing. Disputes between eBay and us have arisen and others may arise in the future; an adverse outcome in such matters could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If either we or eBay are unable to satisfy our performance, payment, or indemnification obligations under these agreements, we could incur operational difficulties or losses or be required to make substantial indemnification or other payments to eBay.Our relationship with eBay is governed, in part, by an operating agreement entered into at separation with a term of five years (expiring July 2020). This operating agreement defines a number of important elements of our commercial relationship with eBay, as well as certain obligations and restrictions that limit PayPal’s provision of services to certain competitive platform operators of eBay (as specified in the operating agreement). eBay remains a significant source of our revenues and operating income. We expect the portion of our revenue and operating income attributable to eBay to continue to decline due to various factors (many of which are beyond our control), including the expiration (or earlier termination) of the operating agreement with eBay, and the extent to which eBay intermediates payments on its platform (including by acting as a merchant of record), limits the availability of PayPal as a payment option or offers (or promotes) alternative payment options, directs transactions on its platforms to different providers of payment services, or eliminates or modifies its risk management or customer protection programs on its platforms, which could result in customer dissatisfaction, reduction in eBay volume, and other consequences adverse to our business. If we are unable to generate sufficient business from our non-eBay customers to offset the expected reduction in the portion of our business attributable to eBay, it could materially impact the growth in our business and our ability to meet our long-term financial targets. Risks Related to Our Common Stock The price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly. The price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including, but not limited to:•actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;•changes in financial estimates by us or securities analysts and recommendations or lack of coverage and reports by securities analysts;•changes in our capital structure;•the activities of our competitors; •speculation, coverage, or sentiment in the media or the investment community;•the operating and stock price performance and valuation of comparable companies;•our quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in our industry;•the public's reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements, and our filings with the SEC;•additions or departures of key personnel; •announcements related to litigation, regulation, or disputes;•changes to the regulatory and legal environment under which we operate; and•market conditions or trends in the payments industry, the industries of merchants, and the domestic and worldwide economy as a whole.As a result of these and other factors, investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above the price at which they purchase our common stock. In addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies like us. These broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In addition, in the past, some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have been subject to class action or derivative lawsuits. The filing of a lawsuit against us, regardless of the outcome, could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, as it could result in substantial legal costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources. 34 Table of Contents Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the state courts of the State of Delaware, or, if no state court located in the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the District of Delaware, as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could discourage lawsuits against us and our directors and officers. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that unless the corporation otherwise determines, the state courts of the State of Delaware, or, if no state court located in the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the District of Delaware, will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors or officers to us or our stockholders, any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“DGCL”) or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes with us or our directors or officers, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors and officers. Alternatively, if a court outside of Delaware were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above, we could incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may prevent or delay an acquisition of our company, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock. Certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of deterring coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and by encouraging prospective acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others:•rules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings;•the fact that directors may not be elected, removed, or replaced at stockholder-requested special meetings unless a person, entity, or group owns at least a majority of our outstanding common stock;•the right of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock and to determine the voting, dividend, and other rights of preferred stock without stockholder approval;•the ability of our directors, and not stockholders, to fill vacancies on our board of directors in most circumstances and to determine the size of our board of directors;•the prohibition on stockholders acting by written consent; and•the absence of cumulative rights in the election of directors.We have also elected not to be governed by Section 203 of the DGCL, which provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that acquire, or are affiliated with a person that acquires, more than 15% of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation, or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the date on which that person or its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15% of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, however, contains a provision that generally mirrors Section 203 of the DGCL, except that it provides for a 20% threshold instead of the 15% provided for by the DGCL. These provisions could delay or prevent a change of control that our stockholders may favor.While these provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers, they will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and may delay or prevent an acquisition that our Board of Directors determines is not in the best interests of us and our stockholders. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. 35 Table of Contents We own and lease various properties in the U.S. and other countries around the world. We use the properties for executive and administrative offices, data centers, product development offices, and customer service offices. As of December 31, 2018, our owned and leased properties provided us with aggregate square footage as follows: United States Other Countries Total (In millions)Owned facilities1.1 0.2 1.3Leased facilities1.2 1.9 3.1Total facilities2.3 2.1 4.4 We own a total of approximately 106 acres of land, with approximately 85 acres in the U.S. Our corporate headquarters are located in San Jose, California and occupy approximately 0.7 million of owned square feet. The information set forth under “Note 13—Commitments and Contingencies—Litigation and Regulatory Matters” to the consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including statements that involve expectations, plans or intentions (such as those relating to future business, future results of operations or financial condition, new or planned features or services, or management strategies). These forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as “may,” “will,” “would,” “should,” “could,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “intend,” “strategy,” “future,” “opportunity,” “plan,” “project,” “forecast,” and other similar expressions. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, among others, those discussed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as in our consolidated financial statements, related notes, and the other information appearing elsewhere in this report and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). We do not intend, and undertake no obligation except as required by law, to update any of our forward-looking statements after the date of this report to reflect actual results or future events or circumstances. Given these risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. You should read the following “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this report. Unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires, references to “we,” “our,” “us,” “the Company” and “PayPal” refer to PayPal Holdings and its consolidated subsidiaries. 39 Table of Contents Business Environment We are a leading technology platform and digital payments company that enables digital and mobile payments on behalf of consumers and merchants worldwide. PayPal is committed to democratizing financial services and empowering people and businesses to join and thrive in the global economy. Our goal is to enable our consumers and merchants to manage and move their money anywhere in the world, anytime, on any platform, and using any device. We also facilitate person-to-person (“P2P”) payments through our PayPal, Venmo and Xoom products. Our combined payment solutions, including our PayPal, PayPal Credit, Braintree, Venmo, Xoom, and iZettle products, compose our proprietary Payments Platform.We operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened regulatory focus on all aspects of the payments industry. That focus continues to become even more heightened as regulators on a global basis focus on such important issues as countering terrorist financing, anti-money laundering, privacy, cybersecurity, and consumer protection. Some of the laws and regulations to which we are subject were enacted recently, and the laws and regulations applicable to us, including those enacted prior to the advent of digital and mobile payments, are continuing to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation. New or changing laws and regulations, including how such laws and regulations are interpreted and implemented, as well as increased penalties and enforcement actions related to non-compliance, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Therefore, we monitor these areas closely to design compliant solutions for our customers who depend on us.Information security risks for global payments and technology companies like us have significantly increased in recent years. We are not immune to these risks and there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. For additional information regarding our information security risks, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” under the caption—“Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to our reputation, business and financial condition.”The United Kingdom (“U.K.”) held a referendum in June 2016 in which a majority of voters approved an exit from the European Union (“EU”) (commonly referred to as “Brexit”). In March 2017, the U.K. government initiated the exit process under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, which commenced a two-year period expiring on March 29, 2019, after which time the U.K. is expected to leave the EU in the absence of any effective extension to the Article 50 period. Political negotiations are underway; however, there is a significant lack of clarity over the terms of the U.K.'s exit from the EU and the terms of the U.K.'s future relationship with the EU. The U.K.'s financial service regulators are implementing Temporary Permission Regimes (“TPR”) that are expected to be put in place by the U.K.'s government to support European Economic Area (“EEA”) financial service firms in continuing to conduct business in the U.K. should the U.K. exit the EU without an agreement. The final TPR rules are expected to be published in the first quarter of 2019 and will come into effect when the U.K. leaves the EU. Accordingly, we may need to adjust our business to comply with additional legal and regulatory requirements if accessing the TPR. We are currently unable to determine the impact that Brexit will have on our business, as any impact will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, trade, regulatory, and other negotiations. For additional information on how Brexit could affect our business, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” under the caption—“The United Kingdom’s departure from the EU could adversely affect us.” Brexit could adversely affect U.K., regional (including European) and worldwide economic and market conditions, and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the British Pound and Euro. We have foreign exchange exposure management programs designed to help reduce the impact from foreign currency rate movements. In 2018, 2017, and 2016, net revenues generated from our U.K. operations constituted 11%, 11% and 12%, respectively, of total net revenues. In 2018, 2017, and 2016, net revenues generated from the EU (excluding the U.K.) constituted less than 20% of total net revenues. Approximately 31% and 30% of our gross loans and interest receivables as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were generated from our U.K. operations. Approximately 7% and 5% of our gross loans and interest receivables as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were generated from the EU (excluding the U.K.) operations. 40 Table of Contents Overview of Results of Operations The following table provides a summary of our consolidated GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016: Year Ended December 31, Percent Increase/(Decrease) 2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 (In millions, except percentages and per share amounts)Net revenues$15,451 $13,094 $10,842 18 % 21 %Operating expenses13,257 10,967 9,256 21 % 18 %Operating income2,194 2,127 1,586 3 % 34 %Operating margin14% 16% 15% ** **Income tax expense319 405 230 (21)% 76 %Effective tax rate13% 18% 14% ** **Net income$2,057 $1,795 $1,401 15 % 28 %Net income per diluted share$1.71 $1.47 $1.15 16 % 28 %Net cash provided by operating activities$5,483 $2,531 $3,158 117 % (20)% All amounts in tables are rounded to the nearest million, except as otherwise noted. As a result, certain amounts may not recalculate using the rounded amounts provided.** Not MeaningfulNet revenues increased $2.4 billion, or 18%, in 2018 and $2.3 billion, or 21%, in 2017. The increase was primarily driven by growth in TPV (as defined below under “Net Revenues”) of 27% in 2018 and 27% in 2017. Net revenues from our acquisitions completed in 2018 and 2017 collectively contributed approximately one percentage point to the growth rate in 2018. The increase from the impact of acquisitions was offset by a decrease in interest and fee income due to the sale of our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio to Synchrony Bank in July 2018, which resulted in a negative impact of approximately four percentage points to the net revenues growth rate in 2018. In 2017, net revenues from our acquisitions of TIO and Swift were not material.Total operating expenses increased $2.3 billion, or 21%, in 2018 and $1.7 billion, or 18%, in 2017. The increase in 2018 was due primarily to an increase in transaction expense, general and administrative, transaction and loan loss, sales and marketing, and restructuring and other expenses. Operating expenses related to our acquisitions completed in 2018 and 2017 collectively contributed approximately three percentage points to the growth rate in total operating expenses in 2018. In March 2018, management decided to wind down TIO's operations. The increase in total operating expense in 2017 was due primarily to an increase in transaction expense, sales and marketing, general and administrative, product development, and restructuring and other charges. Operating expenses related to TIO and Swift collectively contributed one percentage point to the 2017 growth rate. Operating income increased $67 million, or 3%, in 2018 and increased $541 million, or 34% in 2017. Operating income increased in 2018 and 2017 due primarily to the increase in net revenues, offset by the growth in operating expenses. Our acquisitions completed in 2018 and 2017 collectively had a negative impact of approximately seven percentage points to the 2018 growth rate in operating income. Our acquisitions in 2017 collectively had a negative impact of four percentage points on our 2017 growth rate in operating income. Our operating margin was 14%, 16%, and 15% in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Operating margin in 2018 was negatively impacted by growth in our transaction expense, which increased 26% in 2018, compared to net revenues, which increased 18% in the same period, as well as the negative impact of acquisitions. These impacts in 2018 were partially offset by operating efficiencies in our business. Operating margin in 2017 was negatively impacted by growth in our transaction expense, which increased 32% in 2017, compared to net revenues, which increased 21% in the same period, as well as restructuring expense of $40 million incurred in 2017. These impacts in 2017 were offset by operating efficiencies in our business, and a one-time benefit of $322 million pertaining to reversal of allowances related to loans and interest receivables due to the designation as held for sale of our U.S. consumer credit portfolio in November 2017. Net income increased by $262 million, or 15%, in 2018 and $394 million, or 28%, in 2017. The increase in net income in 2018 was attributable to an increase in operating income of $67 million and an increase in other income (expense), net of $109 million, which was driven by unrealized gains on equity investments and an increase in interest income, partially offset by an increase in interest expense. The increase in net income was further impacted by a decrease in income tax expense of $86 million, primarily driven by a reduction in net tax expense recognized with respect to the Tax Act, partially offset by an increase in tax expense due to the increase in operating income and other income (expense), net. The increase in net income in 2017 was attributable to an increase in operating income of $541 million and an increase in other income (expense), net of $28 million, partially offset by an increase in income tax expense of $175 million. 41 Table of Contents Non-GAAP financial measures The following table provides a summary of our consolidated non-GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016: Year Ended December 31, Percent Increase/(Decrease) 2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 (In millions, except percentages and per share amounts)Non-GAAP net revenues$15,451 $13,055 $10,842 18% 20 %Non-GAAP operating income$3,349 $2,755 $2,174 22% 27 %Non-GAAP operating margin22% 21% 20% ** ** Non-GAAP income tax expense$618 $510 $394 21% 29 %Non-GAAP net income$2,913 $2,318 $1,825 26% 27 %Non-GAAP net income per diluted share$2.42 $1.90 $1.50 28% 27 %Free Cash Flow(1)$4,660 $1,864 $2,489 150% (25)% All amounts in tables are rounded to the nearest million, except as otherwise noted.

The year ended December 31, 2017 includes a negative impact of approximately $1.3 billion due to the change in presentation of the U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio subsequent to its designation as held for sale in November 2017.Non-GAAP net revenues, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP income tax expense, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted share, and free cash flow are not financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). For information on how we compute these non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, please refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Information” below. Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange Rates We have significant international operations that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar, and Canadian Dollar, subjecting us to foreign currency risk which may adversely impact our financial results. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar versus the British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar, and Canadian Dollar, as well as other currencies in which we conduct our international operations, impacts the translation of our net revenues and expenses generated in these foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar. In 2018, 2017, and 2016, we generated approximately 46%, 46% and 47% of our net revenues from customers domiciled outside of the United States, respectively. Because we have generated substantial net revenues internationally in recent periods, including during the periods presented, we are subject to the risks of doing business in countries outside of the U.S. as discussed under “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition.” We calculate the year-over-year impact of foreign currency movements on our business using prior period foreign currency exchange rates applied to current period transactional currency amounts. While changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported results, we have a foreign currency exchange exposure management program whereby we designate certain foreign currency exchange contracts as cash flow hedges intended to reduce the impact on earnings from foreign currency exchange rate movements. Gains and losses from these foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized as a component of transaction revenues in the same period the forecasted transactions impact earnings. 42 Table of Contents In the years ended December 31, 2018 and , the year-over-year foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar had the following impact on our reported results: 2017 Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 (In millions)Favorable impact to net revenues (exclusive of hedging impact)$123 $10Hedging impact(23) 17Favorable impact to net revenues 100 27Unfavorable impact to operating expense(18) (21)Net favorable impact to operating income$82 $6 While we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to help reduce the impact on earnings from foreign currency exchange rate movements, it is impossible to predict or eliminate the total effects of this exposure. Additionally, in connection with our services that are paid for in multiple currencies, we generally set our foreign currency exchange rates daily, and may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign currency exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the times that we set our foreign currency exchange rates. Given that we also have foreign currency exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries, we have an additional foreign currency exchange exposure management program whereby we use foreign currency exchange contracts to offset the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency exchange gains and losses on our assets and liabilities are recorded in other income (expense), net, and are offset by the gains and losses on the foreign currency exchange contracts. These foreign currency exchange contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. Financial Results Net revenues Due to the diversification of PayPal’s business through strategic partnerships, new products, and acquisitions, in the first quarter of 2018, we updated our definitions of “active accounts” and “total payment volume (TPV)” as described below.Active Accounts: An active account is an account registered directly with PayPal or a platform access partner that has completed a transaction on our Payments Platform, not including gateway-exclusive transactions, within the past 12 months. The definition of active accounts has been expanded to include payments made or outstanding balances held on our co-branded credit card program. The definition has also been expanded to include accounts from our platform access partners. A platform access partner is a third party whose customers are provided access to PayPal’s Payments Platform through such third party’s login credentials. This expanded definition captures uniquely identifiable accounts for which PayPal receives economic benefits for completed transactions processed on behalf of customers who have established a relationship with PayPal.Total Payment Volume: The value of payments, net of reversals, successfully completed on our Payments Platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions. The definition of TPV has been expanded to include PayPal’s diversification into new partner payment solutions such as certain tokenized transactions and contextual commerce which expand our opportunities for growth.The revised definition also captures TPV from our merchant debit card program. Due to their inclusion in TPV, revenues from these transactions were reclassified from “other value added services” to “transaction revenues” with no change to “total net revenues.”These revisions also impacted previously reported results for other non-financial key performance metrics, including number of payment transactions and payment transactions per active account. Prior period metrics have been revised in this filing to conform to the new definitions.Our revenues are classified into the following two categories:•Transaction revenues: Net transaction fees charged to merchants and consumers on a transaction basis primarily based on the volume of activity, or TPV, completed on our Payments Platform. Growth in TPV is directly impacted by the number of payment transactions that we enable on our Payments Platform. Payment transactions are the total number of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed through our Payments Platform, or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution not including gateway-exclusive transactions. We earn additional fees on transactions settled in foreign currencies when we enable cross-border transactions (i.e., transactions where the merchant or consumer are in different countries).•Other value added services: Net revenues derived primarily from revenue earned through partnerships, subscription fees, gateway fees, and other services we provide to our merchants and customers. We also earn revenues from interest and fees earned primarily on our PayPal credit portfolio of loans receivable, gain on sale of participation interest in certain loans and advances, and interest earned on certain PayPal customer account balances.Our revenues can be significantly impacted by the following:•The mix of merchants, products, and services;•The mix between domestic and cross-border transactions;•The geographic region or country in which a transaction occurs; and•The amount of our credit loans receivable outstanding with merchants and consumers. 43 Table of Contents Net revenues analysis The components of our net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were as follows: Year Ended December 31, Percent Increase/(Decrease) 2018 2017(1) 2016(1) 2018 2017 (In millions, except percentages)Transaction revenues$13,709 $11,501 $9,585 19% 20%Other value added services1,742 1,593 1,257 9% 27%Net revenues$15,451 $13,094 $10,842 18% 21% (1) Amounts in the prior period were reclassified to conform to current period presentation. Transaction revenues Transaction revenues increased by $2.2 billion, or 19%, in 2018 compared to 2017, and by $1.9 billion, or 20%, in 2017 compared to 2016. The increase in transaction revenues in 2018 and 2017 was due primarily to the growth in TPV, mainly from our PayPal and Braintree products, and in the number of payment transactions, both of which resulted primarily from an increase in our active accounts. Current year acquisitions did not have a material impact on the growth rate of transaction revenues; however, they contributed approximately 2.9 million new active accounts during the year. Net losses from our foreign currency exchange contracts recognized as a component of transaction revenues in 2018 were $23 million, compared to net gains of $17 million in 2017. Refer to “Note 10—Derivative Instruments” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our foreign currency exposure management program. The following table provides a summary of our active accounts, number of payment transactions, TPV and related metrics: 44 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, Percent Increase/(Decrease) 2018 2017(1) 2016(1) 2018 2017 (In millions, except percentages)Active accounts(2)267 229 199 17% 15%Number of payment transactions(3)9,871 7,769 6,295 27% 23%Payment transactions per active account(4)36.9 34.0 31.6 9% 8%TPV(5)$578,419 $456,179 $359,928 27% 27%Percent of cross-border TPV19% 21% 22% ** ** All amounts in tables are rounded to the nearest million except as otherwise noted.

Transaction revenues grew more slowly than both TPV and the number of payment transactions in 2017 due primarily to a higher proportion of P2P transactions, primarily from our PayPal and Venmo products. The impact of increases or decreases in prices charged to our customers did not significantly impact transaction revenue growth in 2018 or 2017. Other value added services Net revenues from other value added services increased by $149 million, or 9%, in 2018 compared to 2017, and by $336 million, or 27%, in 2017 compared to 2016. Growth in net revenues from other value-added services in 2018 and 2017 was due primarily to interest and fee income earned on our loans receivable portfolio. In 2018, net revenue from other value added services was also positively impacted by growth in interest earned on customer balances. The completion of the sale of our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio in July 2018 resulted in lower interest and fee income in the second half of 2018, partially offset by an increase in revenue share with Synchrony Bank and approximately $109 million of revenue earned from transition servicing activities. Swift revenues contributed approximately nine percentage points and three percentage points to the 2018 and 2017 growth rates, respectively.The total consumer and merchant loans receivable balance, including loans and receivables, held for sale, as of December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 was $2.7 billion, $7.8 billion, and $5.7 billion, respectively, which reflected a year-over-year decrease of 66% in 2018 compared to 2017, and an increase of 37% in 2017 compared to 2016. The decline in 2018 was primarily driven by the completion of the sale of U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio. In November 2017, we reached an agreement to sell our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio to Synchrony Bank to free up balance sheet capacity and cash flow for other uses and mitigate balance sheet risk. Historically, this portfolio was reported as outstanding principal balances, net of any participation interest sold and pro rata allowances, including unamortized deferred origination costs and estimated collectible interest and fees. Upon approval by our Board of Directors of the decision to sell these receivables, the portfolio was reclassified as held for sale, and recorded at the lower of cost or fair value. Due to the designation as held for sale, the associated allowance for this portfolio was reversed, resulting in an increase of approximately $39 million in revenue from other value added services in 2017. Following the closing of this transaction in July 2018, Synchrony Bank became the exclusive issuer of the PayPal Credit online consumer financing program in the U.S., and we no longer hold an ownership interest in the receivables generated through the program (other than receivables that have been or are designated to be charged off and are fully reserved). The transaction was accounted for as a true sale, and following the completion of the sale, the receivables are no longer reported on our consolidated financial statements. Subsequent to the sale, we earn a revenue share on the portfolio of consumer receivables owned by Synchrony Bank, which is recorded in net revenues from other value added services. We expect this transaction to negatively impact other value-added services revenue growth for the first two quarters of 2019. The corresponding negative impact on total net revenue growth rate for each of those quarters is expected to be between 6% and 8%, although this estimate is subject to various uncertainties and the actual impact may be different. 45 Table of Contents Operating Expenses The following table summarizes our operating expenses and related metrics we use to assess the trend in each: Year Ended December 31, Percent Increase/(Decrease) 2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 (In millions, except percentages)Transaction expense$5,581 $4,419 $3,346 26 % 32 %Transaction and loan losses1,274 1,011 1,088 26 % (7)%Customer support and operations1,482 1,364 1,267 9 % 8 %Sales and marketing1,313 1,128 969 16 % 16 %Product development1,071 953 834 12 % 14 %General and administrative1,451 1,155 1,028 26 % 12 %Depreciation and amortization776 805 724 (4)% 11 %Restructuring and other charges309 132 — 134 % ** Total operating expenses$13,257 $10,967 $9,256 21 % 18 %Transaction expense rate(1)0.96% 0.97% 0.93% Transaction and loan loss rate(2)0.22% 0.22% 0.30% (1) Transaction expense rate is calculated by dividing transaction expense by TPV. Prior year rates were revised to reflect updated TPV definition, as discussed above. (2) Transaction and loan loss rate is calculated by dividing transaction and loan losses by TPV. Prior year rates were revised to reflect updated TPV definition, as discussed above.** Not Meaningful Transaction expense Transaction expense is primarily composed of the costs we incur to accept a customer’s funding source of payment. These costs include fees paid to payment processors and other financial institutions in order to draw funds from a customer’s credit or debit card, bank account, or other funding source they have stored in their digital wallet. Transaction expense also includes fees paid to disbursement partners to enable a transaction. We refer to the allocation of funding sources used by our consumers as our “funding mix.” The cost of funding a transaction with a credit or debit card is generally higher than the cost of funding a transaction from a bank or through internal sources such as a PayPal account balance or PayPal Credit. As we expand the availability and presentation of alternative funding sources to our customers, our funding mix may change, which could increase or decrease our transaction expense rate. The cost of funding a transaction is also impacted by the geographic region or country in which a transaction occurs because we generally pay lower rates for transactions funded with credit cards outside the U.S. than in the U.S. Transaction expense increased by $1.2 billion, or 26%, in 2018 compared to 2017, and increased by $1.1 billion, or 32%, in 2017 compared to 2016. The increase in transaction expense in 2018 was primarily attributable to an increase in TPV of 27%. The increase in transaction expense in 2017 was primarily attributable to an increase in TPV of 27% and higher assessments charged by payment processors and other financial institutions.The transaction expense rate in 2018 remained relatively consistent with the transaction expense rate for 2017. The increase in our transaction expense rate in 2017 compared to 2016 was due primarily to higher assessments charged by payment processors and other financial institutions. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, approximately 2% of TPV was funded with PayPal Credit. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, approximately 43%, 43%, and 44% of TPV, respectively, was generated outside of the U.S. 46 Table of Contents Transaction and loan losses Transaction losses include the expense associated with our buyer and seller protection programs, fraud, and chargebacks. Loan losses include the losses associated with our merchant and consumer loans receivable portfolio, except loans and interest receivable, held for sale. Our transaction and loan losses fluctuate depending on many factors, including TPV, macroeconomic conditions, changes to our customer protection programs, the impact of regulatory changes, and the credit quality of loans receivable arising from transactions funded with our credit products for consumers and loans and advances to merchants. The components of our transaction and loan losses for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 were as follows: Year Ended December 31, Percent Increase/(Decrease) 2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 (In millions, except percentages)Transaction losses$1,059 $823 $655 29% 26 %Loan losses215 188 433 14% (57)%Transaction and loan losses$1,274 $1,011 $1,088 26% (7)%Transaction loss rate(1)0.18% 0.18% 0.18% (1) Transaction loss rate is calculated by dividing transaction losses by TPV. Prior year rates were revised to reflect updated TPV definition, as discussed above.Transaction and loan losses increased by $263 million, or 26%, in 2018 compared to 2017, and decreased by $77 million, or 7%, in 2017 compared to 2016. Transaction losses increased by $236 million, or 29%, in 2018 compared to 2017, and increased by $168 million, or 26%, in 2017 compared to 2016, due primarily to higher TPV. Our transaction loss rate remained flat in 2018, 2017, and 2016. Loan losses increased by $27 million, or 14%, in 2018 compared to 2017 and decreased by $245 million, or 57%, in 2017 compared to 2016. The increase in loan losses in 2018 was primarily due to the increase in our merchant loans and advances receivable balances, partially offset by a decline resulting from the sale of our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio in the third quarter of 2018 and the portfolio's designation as held for sale during the first two quarters of 2018. The decrease in loan losses in 2017 was due primarily to the reversal of approximately $283 million of allowance on loans receivable due to the designation of our U.S. consumer credit portfolio as held for sale. The consumer loans receivable balance as of December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 was $704 million, $326 million, and $5.1 billion, respectively, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 116% from 2017 to 2018 and a decrease of 94% from 2016 to 2017. The increase in consumer loan receivables in 2018 was due to growth in international markets. Approximately 93% of our consumer loans receivables outstanding as of December 31 2018 and December 31, 2017 were due from consumers in the U.K. The decrease in consumer loan receivables in 2017 was due to the designation of U.S. consumer credit portfolio as held for sale. The following table provides information regarding the credit quality of our consumer loans and interest receivable balance: December 31, 2018 2017Percent of consumer loans and interest receivables current94.9% 96.0%Percent of consumer loans and interest receivables > 90 days outstanding(1)1.7% 1.2%Net charge off rate(2)3.1% 3.9% (1) Represents percentage of balances which are 90 days past the billing date to the consumer.(2) Net charge off rate is the annual ratio of net credit losses on consumer loans receivables as a percentage of the average daily amount of consumer loans and interest receivables balance during the year. We offer business financing solutions to certain small- and medium-sized merchants. Total merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable outstanding as of December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, net of participation interest sold, were $1.9 billion, $1.0 billion, and $558 million, respectively, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 85% from 2017 to 2018 and an increase of 81% from 2016 to 2017. The increase in merchant receivables in 2018 was due to growth in our PayPal Business Loan (“PPBL”) portfolio and an increase in the availability of our PayPal Working Capital (“PPWC”) product. Approximately 87% and 10% of our merchant receivables outstanding as of December 31 2018 were due from merchants in the U.S. and U.K. as compared to 83% and 13% as of December 31, 2017, respectively. The increase in merchant receivables in 2017 was due to the acquisition of Swift, which included their pre-existing loan receivables portfolio, and an increase in the availability of our PPWC product domestically and internationally.The following table provides information regarding the credit quality of our merchant receivables: 47 Table of Contents December 31, 2018(1) 2017Merchant loans and advances Percent of merchant receivables within original expected or contractual repayment period91.0% 87.4%Percent of merchant receivables > 90 days outstanding after the end of original expected or contractual repayment period3.7% 5.5% (1) Excludes $30 million of loan receivables related to iZettle merchant receivables.Modifications to the acceptable risk parameters of our PayPal credit products for the periods presented did not have a material impact on our loans and interest receivables. For additional information, see “Note 11—Loans and Interest Receivable” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” under the caption—“Some of our credit products expose us to additional risks.” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Customer support and operations Customer support and operations expenses include costs incurred to provide 24-hour call support to our customers, our site operations, and other infrastructure costs incurred to support our Payments Platform, costs to support our trust and security programs protecting our merchants and consumers, and other costs incurred related to the delivery of our products.Customer support and operations costs increased $118 million, or 9%, in 2018 compared to 2017 and increased $97 million, or 8%, in 2017 compared to 2016. The increase in 2018 was primarily attributable to an increase in employee-related expenses and platform infrastructure expenses to support the growth in our active accounts and the number of payment transactions occurring on our Payments Platform, partially offset by a decrease in contractor and consulting expenses. Our acquisitions completed in 2018 and 2017 collectively contributed approximately one percentage point to the growth rate in 2018. The increase in 2017 was due primarily to an increase in network infrastructure expenses and contractor and employee related expenses to support the growth in our active accounts and the number of payment transactions occurring on our Payments Platform. Sales and marketing Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of customer acquisition, business development, advertising, marketing programs, and employee compensation and contractor costs to support these programs. Sales and marketing expenses increased $185 million, or 16%, in 2018 compared to 2017 and increased $159 million, or 16%, in 2017 compared to 2016. The increase in 2018 and 2017 was due primarily to higher employee-related expense and higher spend on external marketing campaigns. Our acquisitions completed in 2018 and 2017 collectively contributed approximately seven percentage points to the growth rate in 2018. Product development Product development expenses consist primarily of employee compensation and contractor costs that are incurred in connection with the development of our Payments Platform, new products, and the improvement of our existing products. Product development expenses exclude software and website development costs that are capitalized. The amortization of developed technology is included in depreciation and amortization expense.Product development expenses increased $118 million, or 12%, in 2018 compared to 2017 and increased $119 million, or 14%, in 2017 compared to 2016. The increase in 2018 and 2017 was due primarily to an increase in employee-related expenses. The increase in 2018 was also attributable to an increase in contractor and consulting expenses. Our acquisitions completed in 2018 and 2017 collectively contributed approximately two percentage points to the growth rate in 2018. 48 Table of Contents General and administrative General and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs incurred to provide support to our business, including legal, human resources, finance, risk and compliance, executive, and other support operations. Our legal expenses, including those related to ongoing legal and regulatory proceedings, settlements, judgments, and fines, may fluctuate substantially from period to period.General and administrative expenses increased $296 million, or 26%, in 2018 compared to 2017 and increased $127 million, or 12%, in 2017 compared to 2016. The increase in 2018 was due primarily to an increase in employee-related expenses, professional service expenses, and facilities cost. Additional expenses incurred to support our mergers and acquisitions and the sale of our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio also contributed to the growth rate in 2018. Our acquisitions completed in 2018 and 2017 collectively contributed approximately five percentage points to the growth rate in 2018. The increase in 2017 was due primarily to an increase in employee-related expenses and professional service expenses, and continued investments in compliance programs. Depreciation and amortization The primary components of our depreciation and amortization expenses include the depreciation and amortization of software, including the amortization of capitalized software and website development costs, depreciation of equipment used to deliver our services, and amortization of acquired intangible assets. Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased $29 million, or 4%, in 2018 compared to 2017, and increased $81 million, or 11%, in 2017 compared to 2016. The decrease in 2018 was primarily attributable to fully depreciated assets partially offset by an increase in amortization of acquired intangibles due to acquisitions completed in 2018 and 2017, which contributed seven percentage points to the growth rate. The increase in 2017 was due primarily to additional depreciation expenses associated with investments in our technology platform. Additionally, the increase in depreciation and amortization in 2017 was partially attributable to an impairment charge of $30 million related to a portion of our acquired TIO customer-related intangible assets. For additional information, see “Note 5—Goodwill and Intangible Assets” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Restructuring and other charges Restructuring and other charges primarily consist of restructuring expenses and cost adjustments related to our loans and receivables, held for sale portfolio. Restructuring and other charges increased by $177 million in 2018 compared to 2017 due to an increase of $152 million in cost adjustments, which were primarily driven by charge-offs against loans and interest receivables, held for sale portfolio, prior to its sale in July 2018, and a net loss of $40 million incurred at the conclusion of this sale. Restructuring and other charges increased by $132 million in 2017 compared to 2016 due to restructuring charges of $40 million and cost adjustments of $92 million, which were driven by charge-offs against our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio subsequent to its designation as held for sale in November 2017.In the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, management approved strategic reductions of the existing global workforce, which resulted in restructuring charges of $25 million and $40 million, respectively. The reduction approved in the first quarter of 2018 also included restructuring charges related to the decision to wind down TIO operations. We incurred employee and severance benefits expenses under both the 2018 and 2017 strategic reductions, which were substantially completed by the end of 2018 and 2017, respectively. No restructuring expenses were recognized in 2016. 49 Table of Contents Other income (expense), net Other income (expense), net increased $109 million, or 149%, in 2018 compared to 2017, and increased $28 million, or 62%, in 2017 compared to 2016. The increase in 2018 was primarily driven by net unrealized gains on equity investments due to the favorable impact of observable price changes, which contributed $86 million (including $55 million in the fourth quarter). Additionally, the increase was attributable to growth in interest income of $83 million due to higher interest rates and increase in corporate cash, partially offset by an increase of $70 million in interest expense associated with higher amounts of notes payable outstanding under our credit agreements. The increase in 2017 was primarily driven by an increase in interest income. Income tax expense On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act included significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system including: a federal corporate rate reduction from 35% to 21%; limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation; creation of new minimum taxes such as the base erosion anti-abuse tax (“BEAT”) and Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (“GILTI”) tax; and the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a modified territorial tax system, which resulted in a one time U.S. tax liability on those earnings which have not previously been repatriated to the U.S. (the “Transition Tax”).In connection with our initial analysis of the impact of the Tax Act, we recorded a provisional estimate of discrete net tax expense of $180 million for the period ended December 31, 2017. This discrete expense consisted of provisional estimates of $1,468 million net expense for the Transition Tax payable in installments over eight years, $1,295 million net benefit for the decrease in our deferred tax liability on unremitted foreign earnings, and $7 million net expense for remeasurement of our deferred tax assets/liabilities for the corporate rate reduction and changes in our valuation allowance.During the year ended December 31, 2018, we completed our accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Act. We recognized additional discrete net tax expense of $20 million to the provisional amounts recorded at December 31, 2017 for the enactment-date effects of the Tax Act, for a total of $200 million of discrete net tax expense. The $200 million of total discrete net expense consists of $1,490 million of net federal and state Transition Tax, the majority of which is payable in installments over eight years, $1,295 million net benefit for the decrease in our deferred tax liability on unremitted foreign earnings, and $5 million net expense for remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities for the corporate rate reduction and changes in our valuation allowance. We elected to account for GILTI as a current-period expense when incurred. Legislation and clarifying guidance is expected to continue to be issued by the U.S. Treasury and various states in 2019, which could have a material adverse impact on the value of our U.S. deferred tax assets, result in significant changes to currently computed income tax liabilities for past and current tax periods, and increase our future U.S. tax expense. Our effective tax rate was 13% in 2018, 18% in 2017, and 14% in 2016. The decrease in our effective tax rate in 2018 was primarily due to a favorable shift in earnings and discrete net tax expense recorded for U.S. tax reform in 2017, partially offset by reduced tax benefits for U.S. expenses in 2018 due to the lower U.S. tax rate. The increase in our effective tax rate in 2017 was primarily due to discrete net tax expense recorded for U.S. tax reform, partially offset by the adoption of the new stock-based compensation accounting standard in 2017. See “Note 16—Income Taxes” to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on our effective tax rate. Non-GAAP Financial Information Non-GAAP financial information is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s performance that excludes or includes amounts that create differences between the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation S-K, the following portion of this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” includes a reconciliation of certain non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP.We present non-GAAP financial measures to enhance an investor’s evaluation of our operating results and to facilitate meaningful comparisons of our results between periods. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to, among other things: evaluate our operations, for internal planning and forecasting purposes, and in the calculation of performance-based compensation.We exclude the following items from non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted share, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP effective tax rate: •Stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes. This consists of expenses for equity awards under our equity incentive plans. We exclude stock-based compensation expense from our non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses. The related employer payroll taxes are dependent on our stock price and the timing and size of exercises and vesting of equity awards, over which management has limited to no control, and as such management does not believe it correlates to the operation of our business.•Amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets, impairment of goodwill, and transaction expenses from the acquisition or disposal of a business. We incur amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill in connection with acquisitions and may incur significant gains or losses or transactional expenses from the acquisition or disposal of a business and therefore exclude these amounts from our non-GAAP measures. We exclude these items because management does not believe they are reflective of our ongoing operating results.•Restructuring. These consist of expenses for employee severance and other exit and disposal costs. We exclude restructuring charges primarily because management does not believe they are reflective of our ongoing operating results.•Certain other significant gains, losses, benefits, or charges that are not indicative of our core operating results. These are significant gains, losses, benefits, or charges during a period that are the result of isolated events or transactions which have not occurred frequently in the past and are not expected to occur regularly in the future. We exclude these amounts from our non-GAAP results because management does not believe they are indicative of our ongoing operating results. •Tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments. This adjustment is made to present stock-based compensation and the other amounts described above on an after-tax basis consistent with the presentation of non-GAAP net income. The following tables provide reconciliations of our consolidated non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016: 50 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 (In millions, except percentages)GAAP net revenues$15,451 $13,094 $10,842Other(1)— (39) —Non-GAAP net revenues$15,451 $13,055 $10,842 (1) Elimination of allowance on interest receivable due to the U.S. consumer credit portfolio designation as held for sale.

Includes elimination of allowance on loans receivable ($283 million), allowance on interest receivable ($39 million) due to the designation of the U.S. consumer credit portfolio as held for sale, certain fees associated with the sale of the portfolio ($5 million), and impairment of an investment in an intellectual property fund ($15 million) for the year ended December 31, 2017. 51 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 (In millions, except percentages)GAAP income before income taxes$2,376 $2,200 $1,631GAAP income tax expense319 405 230GAAP net income2,057 1,795 1,401Non-GAAP adjustments to net income: Non-GAAP operating income adjustments (see table above)$1,155 $628 $588Other(1)43 224 —Tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments(342) (329) (164)Non-GAAP net income$2,913 $2,318 $1,825 GAAP income tax expense$319 $405 $230Non-GAAP tax adjustments299 105 164Non-GAAP income tax expense$618 $510 $394 GAAP net income per diluted share$1.71 $1.47 $1.15Non-GAAP net income per diluted share$2.42 $1.90 $1.50Shares used in GAAP diluted share calculation1,203 1,221 1,218Shares used in non-GAAP diluted share calculation1,203 1,221 1,218 GAAP effective tax rate13% 18 % 14%Tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments to net income5% — % 4%Non-GAAP effective tax rate18% 18 % 18% (1) Years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 include tax expense related to the Tax Act ($20 million and $180 million, respectively) and intra-entity transfer of intellectual property ($23 million and $44 million, respectively). In addition to the non-GAAP measures discussed above, we also use free cash flow to assess our performance. Free cash flow represents cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases of property and equipment, and investments in our Payments Platform, which can then be used to, among other things, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions, and repurchase stock. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period. A reconciliation of free cash flow to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is presented below: Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 (In millions)Net cash provided by operating activities(1)$5,483 $2,531 $3,158Less: Purchases of property and equipment(823) (667) (669)Free cash flow(1)$4,660 $1,864 $2,489 (1) The year ended December 31, 2018 includes a positive impact of approximately $1.4 billion due to the completion of the sale of our US consumer credit receivables portfolio in July 2018. The year ended December 31, 2017 includes a negative impact of approximately $1.3 billion due to the change in presentation of the U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio subsequent to its designation as held for sale in November 2017. 52 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources We require liquidity and access to capital to fund our global operations, including customer protection programs, our credit products, capital expenditures, investments in our business, potential acquisitions, working capital, and other cash needs. The following table summarizes the cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017: Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 (In millions)Cash, cash equivalents, and investments(1)(2)$9,710 $7,487(1) Excludes assets related to customer accounts of $20.1 billion and $18.2 billion at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.(2) Excludes total restricted cash of $77 million and $81 million at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, and equity investments of $293 million and $88 million as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Foreign Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments Cash, cash equivalents and investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were $8.7 billion as of December 31, 2018 and $6.1 billion at December 31, 2017, or 89% and 81% of our total cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of those respective dates. At December 31, 2018, all of our cash, cash equivalents, and investments held by foreign subsidiaries were subject to U.S. taxation under Subpart F, GILTI, or the one-time Transition Tax as further discussed in “Note 16—Income Taxes” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Subsequent repatriations will not be taxable from a U.S. federal tax perspective, but may be subject to state or foreign withholding tax. A significant aspect of our global cash management activities involves meeting our customers' requirements to access their cash while simultaneously meeting our regulatory financial ratios commitments in various jurisdictions. Our global cash balances are required not only to provide operational liquidity to our businesses, but also to support our global regulatory requirements across our regulated subsidiaries. As such, not all of our cash is available for general corporate purposes. Credit Facilities In the fourth quarter of 2017, we entered into a credit agreement (“2017 Credit Agreement”) that provided for an unsecured $3.0 billion, 364-day delayed-draw term loan credit facility, which was available in up to three borrowings. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we entered into an amended credit agreement (“Amended Credit Agreement”) which amends and restates in its entirety the 2017 Credit Agreement. The Amended Credit Agreement provides for an unsecured $5.0 billion, 364-day delayed-draw term loan credit facility, which is available in up to four separate borrowings. Funds borrowed under the Amended Credit Agreement may be used to repurchase equity securities from shareholders, to repay intercompany debt, and for other general corporate purposes of the Company and our subsidiaries. Amounts available under the Amended Credit Agreement may be borrowed until April 2019, subject to customary borrowing conditions, and the Amended Credit Agreement will terminate in November 2019.In the first quarter of 2018, we effected two drawdowns aggregating to $2.0 billion under the 2017 Credit Agreement, which were in addition to the outstanding balance of $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2017. In the second quarter of 2018, we repaid $1.0 billion of the borrowings outstanding under the 2017 Credit Agreement. The borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 bore interest at LIBOR of one month plus a margin of 1.125% resulting in a weighted average interest rate of 3.34% and 2.78%, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, $2.0 billion was outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement. Accordingly, at December 31, 2018, $3.0 billion of borrowing capacity was available in up to four drawdowns for the purposes permitted by the Amended Credit Agreement, subject to customary conditions to borrowing.In 2015, we entered into a credit agreement (“2015 Credit Agreement” and, collectively with the Amended Credit Agreement, the “Credit Agreements”) that provides for an unsecured $2.0 billion, five-year revolving credit facility that includes a $150 million letter of credit sub-facility and a $150 million swingline sub-facility, with available borrowings under the revolving credit facility reduced by the amount of any letters of credit and swingline borrowings outstanding from time to time. We may, subject to the agreement of the applicable lenders, increase the commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to $500 million. Funds borrowed under the 2015 Credit Agreement may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes. The 2015 Credit Agreement will terminate in July 2020.During the third quarter of 2017, we drew down $800 million under the 2015 Credit Agreement, which was repaid during the fourth quarter of 2017. The borrowing bore interest at LIBOR of one month plus a margin of 1.125% resulting in a weighted-average interest rate of 2.36%. As of December 31, 2018, no borrowings or letters of credit were outstanding under the 2015 Credit Agreement. Accordingly, at December 31, 2018, $2.0 billion of borrowing capacity was available for the purposes permitted by the 2015 Credit Agreement, subject to customary conditions to borrowing.We also maintain uncommitted credit facilities in various regions throughout the world, with borrowing capacity of approximately $300 million in the aggregate. Interest rate terms for these facilities vary by region and reflect prevailing market rates for companies with strong credit ratings. As of December 31, 2018, no amounts were outstanding under these facilities, and therefore, approximately $300 million of borrowing capacity was available, subject to customary conditions to borrowing. 53 Table of Contents For additional information regarding the terms of our credit facilities, refer to “Note 12—Notes Payable” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have a cash pooling arrangement with a financial institution for cash management purposes. The arrangement allows for cash withdrawals from the financial institution based upon our aggregate operating cash balances held within the financial institution (“Aggregate Cash Deposits”). The arrangement also allows us to withdraw amounts exceeding the Aggregate Cash Deposits up to an agreed-upon limit. The net balance of the withdrawals and the Aggregate Cash Deposits are used by the financial institution as a basis for calculating our net interest expense or income under these arrangements. As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of $4.3 billion in cash withdrawals offsetting our $4.3 billion in Aggregate Cash Deposits held within the financial institution under the cash pooling arrangement. Liquidity for Credit Portfolio Growth Growth in the portfolio of loan receivables increases our liquidity needs and any failure to meet those liquidity needs could adversely affect our business. We continue to evaluate partnerships and third party sources of funding of our credit portfolio. In June 2018, the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (the “CSSF”) agreed that PayPal’s management may designate up to 35% of European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary to be used to extend credit for European and U.S. credit activities. As of December 31, 2018, the cumulative amount approved by management to be designated for credit activities aggregated to $1.5 billion and represented approximately 26% of European customer balances potentially available for corporate use by us at that date as determined by applying financial regulations maintained by the CSSF. No additional amount has been designated for corporate usage by management during the year ended December 31, 2018. We may periodically seek to designate additional amounts of customer balances, if necessary, based on utilization of the approved funds and anticipated credit funding requirements. Our objective is to expand the availability of our credit products with capital from external sources, although there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving that goal. Under certain exceptional circumstances, corporate liquidity could be called upon to meet our obligations related to our European customer balances.In November 2017, we reached an agreement to sell our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio to Synchrony Bank. Historically, this portfolio was reported as outstanding principal balances, net of any participation interest sold and pro rata allowances including, unamortized deferred origination costs and estimated collectible interest and fees. In July 2018, we completed the transaction for total consideration of $6.9 billion, which includes cash consideration of $6.5 billion and a long-term receivable in the amount of $426 million, which was recorded at that time at its present value of $261 million. Following the closing of this transaction, Synchrony Bank became the exclusive issuer of the PayPal credit online consumer financing program in the U.S., and we no longer hold an ownership interest in the receivables generated through the program (other than charged off or designated to be charged off receivables). Credit Ratings As of December 31, 2018, we continue to be rated investment grade by Standard and Poor's Financial Services, LLC and Fitch Ratings, Inc. We expect that these credit rating agencies will continue to monitor our performance, including our capital structure and results of operations. Our goal is to be rated investment grade, but as circumstances change, there are factors that could result in our credit ratings being downgraded or put on a watch list for possible downgrading. If that were to occur, it could increase our borrowing rates, including the interest rate on loans under the Credit Agreements. 54 Table of Contents Risk of Loss The risk of losses from our buyer and seller protection programs are specific to individual customers, merchants and transactions, and may also be impacted by regional variations in, and changes or modifications to, the programs, including as a result of changes in regulatory requirements. For the periods presented in these consolidated financial statements included in this report, our transaction loss rates, calculated by dividing transaction loss by TPV, was 0.18% of TPV. Historical trends may not be an indication of future results. Acquisitions and Stock Repurchases In July 2018, we completed our acquisition of Simility for approximately $107 million in cash. We acquired Simility to enhance our ability to deliver fraud prevention and risk management solutions to merchants globally.In September 2018, we completed our acquisition of iZettle for approximately $2.1 billion in cash (net of cash acquired of $103 million) and $22 million in equity. We acquired iZettle to expand our in-store presence and strengthen our Payments Platform to help small businesses around the world grow and thrive in an omnichannel retail environment.In November 2018, we completed our acquisition of Hyperwallet for approximately $399 million in cash. We acquired Hyperwallet to enhance our payout capabilities and improve our ability to provide an integrated suite of payment solutions to ecommerce platforms and marketplaces around the world. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we repurchased approximately $2.5 billion of our common stock through open market repurchases and approximately $1.0 billion pursuant to an accelerated share repurchase agreement under our stock repurchase programs. As of December 31, 2018, a total of approximately $11.5 billion remained available for future repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we repurchased approximately $1.0 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs. As of December 31, 2017, a total of approximately $5.0 billion remained available for future repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs. Our programs are intended to offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and, subject to market conditions and other factors, may also be used to make opportunistic repurchases of our common stock to reduce outstanding share count. Any share repurchases under our stock repurchase programs may be made through open market transactions, block trades, privately negotiated transactions including accelerated share repurchase agreements or other means at times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate, and will be funded from cash from operations or other financing alternatives. Moreover, any stock repurchases are subject to market conditions and other uncertainties and we cannot predict if or when any stock repurchases will be made. We may terminate our stock repurchase programs at any time without notice. Other Considerations Our liquidity, access to capital, and borrowing costs could be adversely impacted by declines in our credit rating, our financial performance and global credit market conditions, as well as a broad range of other factors. In addition, our liquidity, access to capital, and borrowing costs could also be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition” and “Note 13—Commitments and Contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion of these and other risks facing our business.We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and investments, cash expected to be generated from operations, and our expected access to capital markets, together with potential external funding through third party sources, will be sufficient to fund our operating activities, anticipated capital expenditures, and our credit products for the foreseeable future. Depending on market conditions, we may from time to time issue debt, including in private or public offerings, to fund our operating activities, finance acquisitions, repurchase shares under our share repurchase programs, or reduce our cost of capital. 55 Table of Contents Cash Flows The following table summarizes our consolidated statements of cash flows: Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 (In millions)Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities$5,483 $2,531 $3,158Investing activities840 (4,485) (5,904)Financing activities(1,262) 4,084 2,038Effect of exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash(113) 36 —Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash$4,948 $2,166 $(708) Operating Activities Cash flows from operating activities includes net income adjusted for certain non-cash expenses, timing differences between expenses recognized for provision for transaction and loan losses and actual cash transaction losses incurred, and changes in other assets and liabilities. Significant non-cash expenses for the period include depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation. The cash impact from actual transaction losses incurred during a period is reflected as a negative impact to changes in other assets and liabilities in cash from operating activities. The expenses recognized during the period for provision for loan losses are estimates of probable incurred losses on our consumer and merchant credit products (excluding the U.S. consumer credit portfolio from and after November 2017). Actual charge-offs of receivables related to our consumer and merchant credit products (excluding the U.S. consumer credit portfolio from and after November 2017) have no impact on cash from operating activities.We generated cash from operating activities of $5.5 billion in 2018 primarily due to operating income of approximately $2.2 billion and the positive impact of $1.4 billion of changes in the loans and interest receivable, held for sale, net following the sale of our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio. Adjustments for non-cash expenses of depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation were approximately $1.6 billion during 2018. Adjustments for non-cash expenses related to the provision for transaction and loan losses were approximately $1.3 billion and cost basis adjustments to loans and interest receivable held for sale were $244 million during 2018. The cash generated from operating activities was negatively impacted by changes in other assets and liabilities of $708 million, primarily related to actual cash transaction losses incurred during the period.We generated cash from operating activities of $2.5 billion in 2017 due primarily to operating income of approximately $2.1 billion. Adjustments for non-cash expenses of depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation were approximately $1.5 billion during 2017. Adjustments for non-cash expenses related to the provision for transaction and loan losses were approximately $1.0 billion during 2017. The cash generated from operating activities was negatively impacted by adjustments for non-cash expenses related to deferred income taxes of approximately $1.3 billion during 2017. The cash generated from operating activities was also negatively impacted by changes in working capital primarily related to loans and interest receivable held for sale, net of $1.3 billion due to changes in the presentation of originations and collections on loans within the U.S. consumer credit portfolio subsequent to its designation as held for sale in November 2017, which were presented in operating activities instead of investing activities, offset by changes in other assets and liabilities of $634 million. Collections on the U.S. consumer credit portfolio for originations that occurred prior to November 2017 will continue to be reflected in investing activities.We generated cash from operating activities of $3.2 billion in 2016 due primarily to operating income of approximately $1.6 billion. Adjustments for non-cash expenses of depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation (including excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation) were approximately $1.1 billion during 2016. Adjustments for non-cash expenses related to the provision for transaction and loan losses were approximately $1.1 billion during 2016. The cash generated from operating activities was negatively impacted by changes in working capital primarily related to transaction loss allowance for cash losses, net. Cash paid for income taxes in 2018, 2017, and 2016 was $328 million, $117 million, and $48 million, respectively. Investing Activities Cash flows from investing activities includes purchases, maturities and sales of investments, cash paid for acquisitions, purchases and sales of property and equipment, changes in principal loans receivable, and funds receivable. We generated cash from investing activities of $840 million in 2018 due primarily to maturities and sales of investments of $21.9 billion, changes in principal loans receivable, net of $3.1 billion, and changes in funds receivable from customers of $1.1 billion. These cash inflows were offset by purchases of investments of $22.4 billion, acquisitions of $2.1 billion (net of cash and restricted cash acquired), and purchases of property and equipment of $823 million.The net cash used in investing activities of $4.5 billion in 2017 was due primarily to purchases of investments of $19.4 billion, an increase in funds receivable of $1.6 billion (including the reclassification of $700 million of European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary as cash and cash equivalents), changes in principal loans receivable portfolio (net of collections) originated through our consumer and merchant credit products (excluding originations and collections pertaining to the U.S. consumer credit portfolio from and after November 2017 which are presented in operating activities), of $920 million, acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $323 million, and purchases of property and equipment of $667 million. These net cash outflows were offset by maturities and sales of investments of $18.4 billion. Collections on the U.S. consumer credit portfolio for originations that occurred prior to November 2017 will continue to be reflected in investing activities.The net cash used in investing activities of $5.9 billion in 2016 was due primarily to purchases of investments of $21.0 billion, increases in our loan receivable portfolio (net of collections) originated through our PayPal credit products of $1.5 billion, purchases of property and equipment of $669 million and net increases in funds receivable of $1.1 billion, including the reclassification of $800 million of European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary as cash and cash equivalents. These net cash outflows were offset by maturities and sales of investments of $18.4 billion. 56 Table of Contents Financing Activities Cash flows from financing activities includes proceeds from issuance of common stock, purchases of treasury stock, tax withholdings related to net share settlements of equity awards, borrowings and repayments under financing arrangements, funds payable and amounts due to customers, and excess tax benefits from stock based compensation (for periods prior to 2017). The net cash used in financing activities of $1.3 billion in 2018 was due primarily to the repurchase of $3.5 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, repayments of borrowings under financing arrangements of $1.1 billion, and tax withholdings related to net share settlement of equity awards of $419 million, partially offset by cash inflows from borrowings under financing arrangements of $2.1 billion and changes in funds payable and amounts due to customers of $1.6 billion. The net cash provided by financing activities of $4.1 billion in 2017 was due primarily to increases in funds payable and amounts due to customers of $4.3 billion and borrowings of $1.8 billion. These cash inflows were partially offset by repayments of borrowings of $980 million (including a loan of $170 million assumed in connection with our acquisition of Swift), the repurchase of $1.0 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, and tax withholdings related to net share settlement of equity awards of $166 million.The net cash provided by financing activities of $2.0 billion in 2016 was due primarily to increases in funds payable and amounts due to customers of $3.0 billion, offset in part by the repurchase of $995 million of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs. Free Cash Flow We define free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. Free cash flow was $4.7 billion in 2018, an increase of $2.8 billion from 2017. The increase in free cash flow during the period was due to an increase in cash generated from operating activities of $3.0 billion, which was primarily impacted by changes in the loans and interest receivable held for sale, net, due to the completion of the sale of that portfolio, partially offset by purchases of property and equipment, which were $156 million higher compared to the prior year. Free cash flow generated during 2018 was used for repurchasing our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, funding our credit portfolio, acquisitions, and general business purposes. Free cash flow was $1.9 billion in 2017, a decrease of $625 million from 2016. The decrease in free cash flow during the period was primarily due to lower cash generated from operating activities of $627 million, which was impacted by the change in presentation from investing activities to operating activities of originations and collections on the U.S. consumer credit portfolio subsequent to its designation as held for sale in November 2017. Free cash flow generated during 2017 was used for repurchasing our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, funding our credit portfolio, acquisitions, and general business purposes. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. See “Non-GAAP Financial Information” for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. 57 Table of Contents Effect of Exchange Rates on Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash We had a negative effect of currency exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash during 2018 of $113 million, due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against certain foreign currencies, primarily the Australian dollar and to a lesser extent, the Euro. The positive effect of currency exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash during 2017 of $36 million was due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against certain foreign currencies, primarily the Euro. Currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash in 2016. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. Future Liquidity and Obligations As of December 31, 2018, approximately $1.8 billion of unused credit was available to PayPal Credit account holders compared to $26.4 billion of unused credit as of December 31, 2017. While this amount represents the total unused credit available, we have not experienced, and do not anticipate, that all our PayPal Credit account holders will access their entire available credit at any given point in time. In addition, the individual lines of credit that make up this unused credit are subject to periodic review and termination based on, among other things, account usage and customer creditworthiness. The decrease in unused credit in 2018 as compared to 2017 was due to the sale of our U.S. consumer credit portfolio.Prior to the completion of the sale of our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio in July 2018, when a consumer funded a purchase in the U.S. using a PayPal credit product issued by a chartered financial institution, the chartered financial institution extended credit to the consumer, funded the extension of credit at the point of sale, and advanced funds to the merchant. We purchased the receivables related to the consumer loans extended by the chartered financial institution and, as a result of such purchase, bore the risk of loss in the event of loan defaults. Although the chartered financial institution continued to own each customer account, we owned the related receivable (excluding participation interests sold) and were responsible for all servicing functions related to the account. Subsequent to the completion of the sale of our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio in July 2018, we no longer purchase the receivables related to U.S. consumer loans extended by the chartered financial institution.We have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments for general operating purposes. Changes in our business needs, contractual cancellation provisions, fluctuating interest rates, and other factors may result in actual payments differing from the estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of these payments. The following table summarizes our obligations as of December 31, 2018 that are expected to impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods. We believe we will be able to fund these obligations through our existing cash and investment portfolio and cash expected to be generated from operations. PurchaseObligations OperatingLeases Transition Tax TotalPayments Due During the Year Ending December 31,(In millions)2019$320 $124 $39 $483202078 111 114 303202111 96 114 22120226 81 114 20120235 63 212 280Thereafter19 189 638 846 $439 $664 $1,231 $2,334 The significant assumptions used in our determination of amounts presented in the above table are as follows:•Purchase obligation amounts include minimum purchase commitments for advertising, capital expenditures (computer equipment, software applications, engineering development services and construction contracts), and other goods and services entered into in the ordinary course of business.•Operating lease amounts include minimum rental payments under our non-cancelable operating leases primarily for office and data center facilities. The amounts presented are consistent with contractual terms and are not expected to differ significantly from actual results under our existing leases, unless a substantial change in our headcount needs requires us to expand our occupied space or exit an office facility early.•Transition Tax represents the one-time mandatory tax on previously deferred foreign earnings under the Tax Act, as further discussed in “Note 16—Income Taxes” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As we are unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits, net, the table above does not include $615 million of such non-current liabilities included in deferred and other tax liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2018. 58 Table of Contents Seasonality The Company does not experience meaningful seasonality with respect to net revenues. No individual quarter in 2018, 2017, or 2016 accounted for more than 30% of annual net revenue. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The application of U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect our reported financial condition. We have established detailed policies and control procedures to provide reasonable assurance that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period. The accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to our financial statements. An accounting estimate is considered critical if both (a) the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (b) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to our financial condition. Senior management has discussed the development, selection, and disclosure of these estimates with the Audit, Risk, and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors. Our significant accounting policies, including recent accounting pronouncements, are described in “Note 1—Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the consolidated annual financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.A quantitative sensitivity analysis is provided where that information is reasonably available, can be reliably estimated, and provides material information to investors. The amounts used to assess sensitivity are included to allow users of this report to understand a general direction cause and effect of changes in the estimates and do not represent management’s predictions of variability. For all of these estimates, it should be noted that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted, and estimates require regular review and adjustment. Transaction and loan losses Transaction and loan losses include the expense associated with our customer protection programs, fraud, chargebacks, and credit losses associated with our loans receivable balances. Our transaction and loan losses fluctuate depending on many factors, including: total TPV, macroeconomic conditions, changes to our customer protection programs, the impact of regulatory changes, and the credit quality of loans receivable arising from transactions funded with our credit products, which include our PayPal Credit consumer product and merchant loans and advances arising from our PPWC and PPBL products.We establish allowances for estimated transaction losses arising from processing customer transactions, such as chargebacks for unauthorized credit card use and merchant-related chargebacks due to non-delivery of goods or services, ACH returns, buyer protection program claims, account takeovers, and account overdrafts. Additions to the allowance, in the form of provisions, are reflected in transaction and loan losses in our consolidated statements of income. The allowances are monitored regularly and are updated based on actual claims data. The allowances are based on known facts and circumstances, internal factors including experience with similar cases, historical trends involving loss payment patterns, and the mix of transaction and loss types.We also establish an allowance for loans receivable, which represents our estimate of probable incurred loan losses inherent in our merchant loans and advances and consumer loans receivable. Increases to the allowance for loans receivable are reflected as transaction and loan losses in our consolidated financial statements. This evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates and judgments. In connection with the sale of our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio to Synchrony Bank, and the designation of that portfolio as held for sale in November 2017, we released corresponding allowances against those loans and interest receivable balances. No allowances were established on any newly originated U.S. consumer loan receivables from and after November 2017. Adjustments to the cost basis of this portfolio, which are primarily driven by charge offs, are recorded in restructuring and other charges in our consolidated statements of income. For our consumer loan receivables not subject to the sale agreements with Synchrony Bank, consisting primarily of our international consumer receivables, the allowance is primarily based on forecasted principal balance delinquency rates (“roll rates”). Roll rates are the percentage of balances which we estimate will migrate from one stage of delinquency to the next based on our historical experience, as well as external factors such as estimated bankruptcies and levels of unemployment. Roll rates are applied to the principal amount of our consumer loan receivables for each stage of delinquency, from current to 180 days past the payment due date, in order to estimate the principal loans which have incurred losses and are probable to be charged off. For merchant loans and advances receivable the allowance is primarily based on principal balances, forecasted delinquency rates, and recoveries through the use of a vintage-based loss forecasting model.The allowance for loss against the interest receivable is primarily determined by applying historical average customer account roll rates to the interest receivable balance in each stage of delinquency to project the value of accounts that have incurred losses and are probable to be charged off. The allowance for fees receivable is primarily based on fee balances, forecasted delinquency rates, and recoveries through the use of a vintage-based loss forecasting model. Increases to the allowance for interest receivable are reflected as a reduction of net revenues in our consolidated statements of income. Increases to the allowance for fees receivable are recognized as a reduction in deferred revenues included in other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.Determining appropriate allowances for these losses is an inherently uncertain process and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates. We regularly update our allowance estimates as new facts become known and events occur that may impact the settlement or recovery of losses. The allowances are maintained at a level we deem appropriate to adequately provide for losses incurred at the balance sheet date. Based on our results for the year ended December 31, 2018, an aggregate ten percent increase in our transaction and loan loss rate would negatively impact transaction and loan losses by approximately $127 million. 59 Table of Contents Accounting for Income Taxes Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates, and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective government taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. Our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rates that apply to our foreign earnings. In addition to local country tax laws and regulations, our income tax rate depends on the extent that our foreign earnings are taxed by the U.S. through new provisions under the Tax Act such as the new GILTI tax and BEAT or as a result of our indefinite reinvestment assertion. Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management’s judgment about, and intentions concerning, our future operations. Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings, and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates that are based on a number of factors, including our historical experience and short-range and long-range business forecasts. To the extent deferred tax assets are not expected to be realized, we record a valuation allowance.We recognize and measure uncertain tax positions in accordance with U.S. GAAP, pursuant to which we only recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. U.S. GAAP further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings in the quarter in which such change occurs. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.We file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions around the world. A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited by the relevant tax authorities and finally resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our reserves for income taxes are adequate such that we reflect the benefits more likely than not to be sustained in an examination. We adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest, where appropriate in light of changing facts and circumstances. Settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash.Based on our results for the year ended December 31, 2018, a one-percentage point increase in our effective tax rate would have resulted in an increase in our income tax expense of approximately $24 million. 60 Table of Contents Loss Contingencies We are currently involved in various claims, legal proceedings, and investigations of potential operating violations by regulatory oversight authorities. We regularly review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim, legal proceeding, or potential regulatory violation is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses, and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims, litigation, or other violation and may revise our estimates. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes. Revenue Recognition Application of the accounting principles in U.S. GAAP related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires us to make judgments and estimates. Complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting. Specifically, the determination of whether we are a principal to a transaction (gross revenue) or an agent (net revenue) can require considerable judgment. Further, we provide incentive payments to consumers and merchants, which require judgment to determine whether the payments should be recorded as a reduction to gross revenue. Changes in judgments with respect to these assumptions and estimates could impact the amount of revenue recognized. Valuation of Goodwill and Intangibles The valuation of assets acquired in a business combination and asset impairment reviews require the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to estimate the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in an acquired business to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill. Impairment testing for assets, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, requires the allocation of cash flows to those assets or group of assets and if required, an estimate of fair value for the assets or group of assets. Our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. These valuations require the use of management’s assumptions, which do not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur.We evaluate goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or sooner if indicators of impairment exist. Under U.S. GAAP, the evaluation of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment allows for a qualitative assessment to be performed, which is similar to the U.S. GAAP for evaluating goodwill for impairment. In performing these qualitative assessments, we consider relevant events and conditions, including but not limited to: macroeconomic trends, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance, cost factors, company-specific events, legal and regulatory factors, and our market capitalization. If the qualitative assessments indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than their carrying amounts, we must perform a quantitative impairment test.Under the quantitative impairment test, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds the implied fair value of the respective reporting unit goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset, an impairment loss is recorded in the statement of income. Measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit is based on one or more of the following fair value measures: amounts at which the unit as a whole could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties, present value techniques of estimated future cash flows, valuation techniques based on multiples of earnings or revenue, or a similar performance measure. 61 Table of Contents Market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and investment risk. Management establishes and oversees the implementation of policies governing our investing, funding, and foreign currency derivative activities in order to mitigate market risks. We monitor risk exposures on an ongoing basis. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to interest rate risk relating to our investment portfolio and from interest-rate sensitive assets underlying the customer balances we hold on our consolidated balance sheets as customer accounts. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, approximately 78% and 39%, respectively, of our total cash, cash equivalents, and investment portfolio was held in cash and cash equivalents. The assets underlying the customer balances we hold on our consolidated balance sheets as customer accounts are maintained in interest and non-interest bearing bank deposits, time deposits, U.S. and foreign government and agency securities, and corporate debt securities. We seek to preserve principal while holding eligible liquid assets, as defined by applicable regulatory requirements and commercial law in the jurisdictions where we operate, equal to at least 100% of the aggregate amount of all customer balances. We do not pay interest on amounts due to customers.In the fourth quarter of 2017, we entered into an unsecured $3.0 billion, 364 day delayed-draw term loan credit facility, which was available in up to three borrowings (“2017 Credit Agreement”). In the fourth quarter of 2018, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (“Amended Credit Agreement”), which provides for an unsecured $5.0 billion, 364-day delayed-draw term loan credit facility, which is available in up to four separate borrowings. In the third quarter of 2015, we entered into a $2.0 billion senior unsecured credit facility maturing in 2020 (“2015 Credit Agreement”). We also maintain uncommitted credit facilities in various regions throughout the world with borrowing capacity of approximately $300 million in the aggregate. Borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement and 2015 Credit Agreement, if any, bear interest at floating rates. As a result, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates to the extent of our borrowings. As of December 31, 2018, we had $2.0 billion of borrowings outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement at a weighted average interest rate of 3.34%. Accordingly, at December 31, 2018, $3.0 billion of borrowing capacity was available for the purposes permitted by the Amended Credit Agreement, subject to customary conditions to borrowing. As of December 31, 2018, no borrowings or letters of credit were outstanding under the 2015 Credit Agreement or our uncommitted credit facilities.Interest rates may also adversely impact our customers’ spending levels and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amounts owed to us. Higher interest rates often lead to higher payment obligations by customers of our credit products to us, or to lenders under mortgage, credit card, and other consumer and merchant loans, which may reduce our customers’ ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore lead to increased delinquencies, charge-offs, and allowance for loan and interest receivable, which could have an adverse effect on our net income. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would not have had a material impact on our financial assets or liabilities at December 31, 2018 and 2017. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We have significant operations internationally that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar, and Canadian Dollar, subjecting us to foreign currency exchange rate risk which may adversely impact our financial results. We transact business in various foreign currencies and have significant international revenues and costs. In addition, we charge our international subsidiaries for their use of intellectual property and technology and for certain corporate services. Our cash flows, results of operations, and certain of our intercompany balances that are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses due to foreign currency fluctuations and related hedging activities. We are generally a net receiver of foreign currencies and therefore benefit from a weakening of the U.S. dollar, and are adversely affected by a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, relative to foreign currencies.We have a foreign currency exchange exposure management program designed to identify material foreign currency exposures, manage these exposures, and reduce the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated cash flows and results of operations through the execution of foreign currency exchange contracts. These foreign currency exchange contracts are accounted for as derivative instruments; for additional details related to our foreign currency exchange contracts, please see “Note 10—Derivative Instruments” to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We use foreign currency exchange forward contracts to protect our forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These hedging contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movements. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. The derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) and subsequently reclassified into the financial statement line item in which the hedged item is recorded in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. If we elect to discontinue our cash flow hedges and it is probable that the original forecasted transaction will occur, we continue to report them in AOCI until the forecasted transaction affects earnings at which point we also reclassify the de-designated hedges into earnings. Gains and losses on derivatives held after we discontinue our cash flow hedges and gains and losses on derivative instruments that are not designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in the same financial statement line item to which the derivative relates.We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that changes in exchange rates of 20% for all currencies could be experienced in the near term. If the U.S. dollar weakened by 20% at December 31, 2018 and 2017, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign currency exchange forward contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately $707 million and $536 million lower, respectively. If the U.S. dollar strengthened by 20% at December 31, 2018 and 2017, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign currency exchange forward contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately $707 million and $536 million higher, respectively.We have an additional foreign currency exchange management program whereby we use foreign currency exchange contracts to offset the foreign currency exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency exchange gains and losses on our assets and liabilities are recorded in other income (expense), net, and are offset by the gains and losses on the foreign currency exchange contracts.Adverse changes in exchange rates of 20% for all currencies would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately $295 million and $243 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, without considering the offsetting effect of hedging. Foreign currency exchange contracts in place as of December 31, 2018 would have positively impacted income before income taxes by approximately $308 million, resulting in a net positive impact of approximately $13 million. Foreign currency exchange contracts in place as of December 31, 2017 would have positively impacted income before income taxes by approximately $211 million, resulting in a net negative impact of approximately $32 million. These reasonably possible adverse changes in exchange rates of 20% were applied to total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of our subsidiaries at the balance sheet dates to compute the adverse impact these changes would have had on our income before income taxes in the near term. 62 Table of Contents Investment Risk As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, our equity investments totaled $293 million and $88 million, respectively, which represented approximately 3% and 1% of our total cash and investment portfolio at those dates, respectively, and were related to minority equity interests in companies that are not publicly traded. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we did not hold any marketable equity instruments. We review our investments for impairment when events and circumstances indicate a decline in fair value of such assets below carrying value. Our analysis includes a review of recent operating results and trends, recent sales and acquisitions of the securities in which we have invested, and other publicly available data.",

        "answer": "As of December 31, 2018, merchant accounts constituted only 7.86% of the total active account base (21 million active merchant accounts out of 267 million total active accounts). Since volume-based fees are the primary revenue stream, this suggests that the retention and growth of the relatively small, high-leverage merchant segment is disproportionately critical to scaling the company's TPV and overall revenue, as merchant acceptance is required for consumers to transact successfully on the platform."

Our PayPal, Venmo and Xoom products also make it safer and simpler for friends and family to transfer funds to each other. We offer merchants an end-to-end payments solution that provides authorization and settlement capabilities, as well as instant access to funds. We help merchants connect with their customers and manage risk. We enable consumers to engage in cross-border shopping and merchants to extend their global reach while reducing the complexity and friction involved in enabling overseas and cross-border trade. We generate revenues by charging fees for providing transaction processing and other payment-related services based primarily on the volume of activity processed through our Payments Platform. We generally do not charge consumers to fund or draw from their accounts; however, we generate revenue from consumers on fees charged for foreign currency exchange. We also earn revenue by providing value added services to consumers and merchants, such as our PayPal Credit and gateway services. Our gateway services, which include our Payflow Gateway services and Braintree Gateway services, provide the technology that links a merchant’s website to its processing network and merchant account and enable merchants to accept payments online with credit or debit cards. Strategy Our ability to grow revenue is affected by, among other things, consumer spending patterns, merchant and consumer adoption of digital payment methods, the expansion of multiple commerce channels, the growth of mobile devices and merchant and consumer applications on those devices, the growth of consumers globally with Internet and mobile access, the pace of transition from cash and checks to digital forms of payment, our share of the digital payments market, and our ability to innovate new methods of payment that merchants and consumers value. Our strategy to drive growth in our business includes the following:•Growing our core: through expanding our global capabilities, customer base and scale, increasing our customers' use of our products and services by better addressing their everyday needs related to accessing, managing and moving money and expanding the adoption of our solutions by new merchants and consumers;•Expanding our value proposition for customers: by focusing on trust and simplicity, providing risk management and insights from our two-sided Payments Platform and being technology and platform agnostic; •Extending through strategic partnerships: by building new strategic partnerships to provide better experiences for our customers, offering greater choice and flexibility, acquiring new customers and reinforcing our role in the ecosystem; and•Seeking new areas of growth: through new international markets around the world and focusing on innovation both in the digital and the physical world. 4 Table of Contents Key Performance Metrics We measure the relevance of our products to our customers, and therefore the success of our business, through active customer accounts, payment volume and payment transactions:Active Customer Accounts: An active customer account is a registered account that successfully sent or received at least one payment or payment reversal through our Payments Platform, excluding transactions processed through our gateway and Paydiant products, in the past 12 months. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 227 million active customer accounts across more than 200 markets. A market is a geographic area or political jurisdiction, such as a country, territory, or protectorate, in which we offer our services. A country, territory or protectorate is identified by a distinct set of laws and regulations. Number of Payment Transactions: Number of payment transactions is defined as the total number of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed through our Payments Platform, excluding transactions processed through our gateway and Paydiant products.Total Payment Volume (“TPV”): TPV is the value of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed through our Payments Platform, excluding transactions processed through our gateway and Paydiant products. 5 Table of Contents Our Strengths Our business is built on a strong foundation designed to drive growth and differentiate us from our competitors. We believe that our competitive strengths include the following:•Two-sided Platform - our platform connecting merchants and consumers enables PayPal to offer unique end-to-end product experiences while gaining valuable insights into customer behavior through our data. Our platform provides for simple digital and mobile transactions while being both brand and technology agnostic.•Scale - our global scale allows us to drive organic growth. As of December 31, 2017, we had 227 million active customer accounts, which included 18 million active merchant accounts. In 2017, we processed $451 billion of TPV in more than 200 markets around the world.•Brand - we have built a well-recognized and trusted brand. Our marketing efforts play an important role in building brand visibility, usage and overall preference among customers. •Risk Management - our risk management system and tokenization usage are designed to keep our customers safe and to ensure we process legitimate transactions around the world, while reducing illegal, high-risk, or fraudulent transactions.•Regulatory - we believe that our regulatory licenses, which enable us to operate in markets around the world, are a distinct advantage and support business growth. Technology Our Payments Platform utilizes a combination of proprietary technologies and services as well as technologies and services provided by third parties to efficiently and securely facilitate transactions between millions of merchants and consumers worldwide across different channels, markets and networks. Our Payments Platform connects with financial institutions around the world and allows consumers to make purchases using a wide range of payment methods, regardless of where a merchant is located. Consumers who use our Payments Platform can send payments in more than 200 markets across the globe and in more than 100 currencies, withdraw funds to their bank accounts in 56 currencies and hold balances in their PayPal accounts in 25 currencies. A transaction on our Payments Platform can involve multiple participants in addition to us including a merchant, a consumer and the consumer’s funding source provider. We have developed intuitive user interfaces, customer tools on our Payments Platform, transaction processing, and database and network applications that help our customers utilize our suite of products and services. Our Payments Platform, open application programming interfaces, and developer tools are designed to enable developers to innovate with ease and offer robust applications to our global ecosystem of merchants and consumers, while at the same time maintaining the security of our customers’ financial information. The technology infrastructure supporting our Payments Platform simplifies the storage and processing of large amounts of data, and facilitates the deployment and operation of large-scale global products and services and automates much of the administration of large-scale clusters of computers. Our technology infrastructure has been designed around industry-standard architectures to reduce downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences. Our Payments Platform incorporates multiple layers of protection, both for continuity and system redundancy purposes and to help address cybersecurity challenges. We engage in multiple efforts to protect our technology infrastructure and Payments Platform against these challenges, including regularly testing our systems to address potential vulnerabilities. We strive to continually improve our technology infrastructure and Payments Platform to enhance the customer experience and to increase efficiency, scalability and security. Merchant and Consumer Payment Solutions Our combined payment solution capabilities offer our merchants and consumers a broad range of products and services, enabling our merchants to safely and simply receive payments from their customers while allowing our consumers to make seamless transactions across different markets and networks. We partner with our merchants to help grow and expand their businesses by improving sales conversion, providing global reach, offering alternative payment methods, reducing losses through proprietary protection programs and leveraging data analytics. Merchants can onboard quickly with PayPal and are not required to invest in new or specialized hardware. For our standard service, we do not charge merchants setup or recurring fees. We offer access to credit products for certain small and medium-sized merchants through PayPal Working Capital and, with the recent acquisition of Swift Financial Corporation (\"Swift\"), other business loan products. Our PayPal Working Capital product allows businesses to borrow a certain percentage of their annual payment volume processed by PayPal for a fee. Our Swift business loan products provide businesses with access to short-term business financing based on an evaluation of both the applying business as well as the business owner. We believe that our business financing offerings allow us to deepen our engagement with our small and medium-sized business merchants by providing them with access to capital to grow their business that they may not otherwise be able to effectively or efficiently access from traditional banks or other lending providers. Our recent acquisition of Swift also enables us to enhance our underwriting capabilities and strengthen our business financing offerings, helping us to deepen relationships with our existing merchants and expand services to new merchants.PayPal is a popular form of payment for mobile commerce, and our business has grown with the increased adoption of mobile devices. We believe our Braintree products strengthen our position in mobile payments and extend our coverage to a new class of retailers and service providers that offer their services primarily through mobile applications. Through a single Braintree integration, a merchant can begin accepting payments with credit or debit cards, PayPal, Android Pay, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and other payment solutions. We also offer gateway services, including our Payflow Gateway services and Braintree Gateway services, that enable merchants to accept payments online with credit or debit cards. Our gateway services provide the payment gateway technology that links a merchant’s website to its processing network and enable merchants to accept payments online with credit and debit cards. We focus on providing affordable consumer products intended to democratize the management and movement of money. We offer our customers the flexibility to use their account to both purchase and receive payment for goods and services, as well as transfer and withdraw funds. We enable consumers to more safely exchange funds with merchants using a variety of financial resources, which may include a bank account, a PayPal account balance, a PayPal Credit account, a credit or debit card or other stored value products such as coupons and gift cards. We generally do not charge consumers to fund or draw from their accounts. We generate revenue from consumers on fees charged for foreign currency exchange and on interest and fees from our PayPal Credit product. We offer our PayPal Credit product to consumers as a potential funding source at checkout. Once a consumer is approved for credit, PayPal Credit is made available as a funding source in their account. We believe that our consumer credit products allow us to increase engagement with both consumers and merchants on our two-sided network as well as differentiate ourselves from rival payment processors by helping merchants drive incremental sales through products like PayPal Credit. We are responsible for all servicing functions related to all of our credit products. In the U.S., credit originated through our PayPal Credit, PayPal Working Capital and Swift business loan products is currently extended through third-party financial institutions, from whom we purchase the related receivables. For our consumer and merchant credit products outside the U.S., we extend credit through certain international PayPal subsidiaries. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we expanded our strategic consumer credit relationship with Synchrony Financial (\"Synchrony\") and agreed to sell our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio to Synchrony Bank. Following the closing of this transaction, which is expected to occur in the third quarter of 2018, Synchrony Bank will become the exclusive issuer of the PayPal Credit online consumer financing program in the U.S. and we will no longer hold any participation interest in the receivables generated through the program (other than charged off receivables).We offer consumers person-to-person (“P2P”) payment solutions through our PayPal, Venmo and Xoom products. PayPal continues to drive the majority of our total P2P volumes, enabling both domestic and international P2P transfers across our Payments Platform. Our Venmo app in the U.S. is a leading mobile application used to move money between friends and family. Xoom is an international money transfer service that enables our customers to send money to, pay bills for and send prepaid mobile phone reloads for family and friends around the world in a secure, fast and cost-effective way, using their mobile device or personal computers. P2P is a significant customer acquisition channel with network effects that helps us to establish relationships with potential PayPal users by allowing them to join our Payments Platform at the time of making or receiving P2P payments, which drives organic growth. 6 Table of Contents Protecting Merchants and Consumers Protecting merchants and consumers on our Payments Platform from financial and data loss is imperative to successfully competing in the payments industry and sustainably growing our business. Fraudulent activities, such as account takeover, identity theft and counterparty malicious activities, represent a significant and growing risk to merchants and consumers, as well as their payment partners. We provide merchants and consumers with protection programs on most purchase transactions completed through our Payments Platform, except for transactions using our gateway and Paydiant products. We believe that these programs, which protect both merchants and consumers from financial and data loss due primarily to fraud and counterparty non-performance, are generally much broader than similar protections provided by other participants in the payments industry. Many payment providers do not offer merchant protection in general, and those that do generally do not provide protection for online or card not present transactions. As a result, merchants may incur losses for chargebacks and other claims on certain transactions when using other payments providers that they would not incur if they used our payments services. We also provide consumer protection against losses on qualifying purchases and accept claims for 180 days post transaction in the markets that we serve. We believe that this protection is generally consistent with, or better than, that offered by other payments providers. We believe that as a result of these programs, consumers can be confident that they will only be required to pay if they receive the product in the condition as described, and merchants can be confident that they will receive payment for the product that they are delivering to the customer.Our ability to protect both consumers and merchants is based largely on our proprietary end-to-end payments platform and our ability to leverage the data we collect on both sides of the transactions on our two-sided network (i.e., from buyers and sellers, and from senders and receivers of payments). We believe mobile devices will continue to play a significant and increasing role in commerce, including by creating the opportunities to make our ecosystem safer. For example, PayPal is able to use location data from mobile devices and growing protection for the mobile operating environment to reduce risk to merchants and consumers. Our ongoing investment in systems and processes, designed to enhance the safety and security of our products, reflects our goal of having PayPal recognized as one of the world’s most trusted payments brands. 7 Table of Contents Competition The global payments industry is highly competitive. We compete against a wide range of businesses, including banks, credit card providers, technology and ecommerce companies and traditional retailers, many of which are larger than we are, have a dominant and secure position, or offer other products and services to consumers and merchants which we do not offer. We compete against all forms of payments, including credit and debit cards; automated clearing house and bank transfers; other online payment services; mobile payments; and offline payment methods, including cash and check.We compete primarily on the basis of the following:•ability to attract, retain and engage both merchants and consumers with our two-sided platform;•ability to show merchants that they may achieve incremental sales by offering our end-to-end services;•consumer confidence in safety and security of transactions on our Payments Platform, including the ability for consumers to use our products and services without sharing their financial information with the merchant or the party they are paying;•simplicity of our fee structure;•ability to develop products and services across multiple commerce channels, including mobile payments, credit products and payments at the retail point of sale;•trust in our dispute resolution and buyer and seller protection programs;•customer service;•brand recognition and preference;•website, mobile platform and application onboarding, ease-of-use, speed, availability, and dependability;•the technology and payment agnostic nature of our Payments Platform;•system reliability and data security;•ease and quality of integration into third-party mobile applications and operating systems; and•quality of developer tools such as our application programming interfaces and software development kits.In addition to the discussion in this section, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” under the caption “Substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry may harm our business” for further discussion of the potential impact of competition on our business. Research and Development Total research and development expense was $953 million, $834 million and $792 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Intellectual Property The protection of our intellectual property, including our trademarks (particularly those covering the PayPal name), patents, copyrights, domain names, trade dress and trade secrets is important to the success of our business. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on applicable laws and regulations in the U.S. and internationally, as well as a variety of administrative procedures. We also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights when offering or procuring products and services. We have routinely entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors and non-disclosure agreements with parties with whom we conduct business to control access to and limit disclosure of our proprietary information.We pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and internationally. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain aspects of our proprietary technology. We have registered our core brands as trademarks and domain names in the U.S. and a large number of other jurisdictions and have in place an active program to continue to secure trademarks and domain names that correspond to our brands in markets of interest.For additional information regarding some of the risks relating to our intellectual property, including costs of protecting our intellectual property, see the information in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” under the captions “We are subject to patent litigation” and “We may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or third parties may allege that we are infringing their intellectual property rights.” 8 Table of Contents Government Regulation We operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened regulatory focus on all aspects of the payments industry. That focus continues to become even more heightened as regulators on a global basis focus on such important issues as countering terrorist financing, anti-money laundering, privacy and consumer protection. Some of the laws and regulations to which we are subject were enacted recently, and the laws and regulations applicable to us, including those enacted prior to the advent of digital and mobile payments, are continuing to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation. Non-compliance with laws and regulations, increased penalties and enforcement actions related to non-compliance, changes in laws and regulations, or their interpretation, and the enactment of new laws and regulations applicable to us could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Therefore, we monitor these areas closely to design compliant solutions for our customers who depend on us.Government regulation impacts key aspects of our business. We are subject to regulations that affect the payments industry in the markets we operate.Payments Regulation. Various laws and regulations govern the payments industry in the U.S. and internationally. In the U.S., PayPal, Inc. holds licenses to operate as a money transmitter (or its equivalent), which, among other things, subjects PayPal, Inc. to reporting requirements, bonding requirements, limitations on the investment of customer funds and inspection by state regulatory agencies. Outside the U.S., we provide localized versions of our service to customers through various foreign subsidiaries. The activities of those non-U.S. entities are, or may be, supervised by a financial regulatory authority in the jurisdictions in which they operate. Among other regulatory authorities, the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (the “CSSF”), the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Reserve Bank of India, and the Central Bank of Russia have asserted jurisdiction over some or all of our activities in country. This list is not exhaustive, as there are numerous other regulatory agencies that have or may assert jurisdiction over our activities. The laws and regulations applicable to the payments industry in any given jurisdiction are subject to interpretation and change.Banking Agency Supervision. We serve our customers in the European Union through PayPal (Europe) S.à.r.l. et Cie, SCA, a wholly-owned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a bank in Luxembourg by the CSSF. Consequently, we must comply with rules and regulations of the banking industry, including those related to capitalization, funds management, corporate governance, anti-money laundering, disclosure, reporting and inspection. We also are, or may be, subject to banking-related regulations in other countries now or in the future related to our role in the financial industry. In addition, based on our relationships with our partner financial institutions, we are, or may be, subject to indirect regulation and examination by these financial institutions’ regulators.Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) has significant authority to regulate consumer financial products in the United States, including consumer credit, deposit, payment, and similar products. As a large market participant of remittance transfers, the CFPB has direct supervisory authority over our business. The CFPB and other similar regulatory agencies in other jurisdictions may have broad consumer protection mandates that could result in the promulgation and interpretation of rules and regulations that may affect our business.Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing. PayPal is subject to anti-money laundering (“AML”) laws and regulations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, as well as laws designed to prevent the use of the financial systems to facilitate terrorist activities. Our AML program is designed to prevent our payment network from being used to facilitate money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit activities, or to do business in countries or with persons and entities included on designated country or person lists promulgated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls (“OFAC”) and equivalent authorities in other countries. Our AML compliance program, overseen by our AML/Bank Secrecy Act Officer, is composed of policies, procedures and internal controls, and is designed to address these legal and regulatory requirements and assist in managing money laundering and terrorist financing risks.Interchange Fees. Interchange fees associated with four-party payments systems are being reviewed or challenged in various jurisdictions. For example, in the European Union (\"EU\"), the Multilateral Interchange Fee (“MIF”) Regulation caps credit and debit interchange fees for cards payments and provides for business rules to be complied with by any company dealing with card transactions, including PayPal. As a result, the fees that we collect in certain jurisdictions may become the subject of regulatory challenge.Data Protection and Information Security. Aspects of our operations or business are subject to privacy and data protection regulation in the United States (\"U.S.\"), the EU and elsewhere. For example, the EU has adopted a comprehensive General Data Protection Regulation (the \"GDPR\"), which comes into effect in May 2018 and expands the scope of the EU data protection law to all foreign companies processing personal data of EU residents, imposes a strict data protection compliance regime, and includes new rights. In the United States, we are subject to information safeguarding requirements under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act that require the maintenance of a written, comprehensive information security program and in Europe, the operations of our Luxembourg bank are subject to information safeguarding requirements under the Luxembourg Banking Act, among other laws. Regulatory authorities around the world are considering numerous legislative and regulatory proposals concerning privacy and data protection. In addition, the interpretation and application of these privacy and data protection laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in a state of flux.Anti-Corruption. PayPal is subject to applicable anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar anti-corruption laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates. Anti-corruption laws generally prohibit offering, promising, giving, accepting or authorizing others to provide anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to or from a government official or private party in order to influence official action or otherwise gain an unfair business advantage, such as to obtain or retain business. We have implemented policies, procedures, and internal controls that are designed to comply with these laws and regulations.Additional Regulatory Developments. Various regulatory agencies continue to examine a wide variety of issues, including virtual currencies, identity theft, account management guidelines, privacy, disclosure rules, security and marketing that may impact PayPal's business.For an additional discussion on governmental regulation affecting our business, please see the risk factors related to regulation of our payments business and regulation in the areas of consumer privacy, data use and/or security in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” under the caption “Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition” and “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 9 Table of Contents Seasonality The Company does not experience meaningful seasonality with respect to net revenues. No individual quarter in 2017, 2016 or 2015 accounted for more than 30% of annual net revenue. Financial Information About Segments We operate in one business segment and have one reportable segment. See “Note 11—Segment and Geographical Information” to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information including certain financial information about our operations in the U.S. and internationally. Additionally, please see the information in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” under the caption “Our international operations are subject to increased risks, which could harm our business,” which describes risks associated with our foreign operations. Employees As of December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 18,700 people globally, of whom approximately 10,600 were located in the U.S. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. Separation from eBay Inc. PayPal Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in January 2015 for the purpose of owning and operating eBay’s Payments business in connection with the separation and distribution described below. Prior to the contribution of this business to PayPal Holdings, Inc., which occurred prior to the distribution in July 2015, PayPal Holdings, Inc. had no operations. On July 17, 2015 (the “distribution date”), PayPal became an independent publicly traded company through the pro rata distribution by eBay of 100% of the outstanding common stock of PayPal to eBay stockholders (which we refer to as the “separation” or the “distribution”). Each eBay stockholder of record as of the close of business on July 8, 2015 received one share of PayPal common stock for every share of eBay common stock held on the record date. Approximately 1.2 billion shares of PayPal common stock were distributed on July 17, 2015 to eBay stockholders. PayPal’s common stock began “regular way” trading under the ticker symbol “PYPL” on the NASDAQ Stock Market on July 20, 2015. Prior to the separation, eBay transferred substantially all of the assets and liabilities and operations of eBay’s payments business to PayPal, which was completed in June 2015. 10 Table of Contents Available Information The address of our principal executive offices is PayPal Holdings, Inc., 2211 North First Street, San Jose, California 95131.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The following discussion is divided into three sections. The first section, which begins immediately following this paragraph, discusses some of the risks that may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The second section, captioned “Risks Related to the Separation and Our Operation as an Independent Publicly Traded Company,” discusses some of the risks relating to our separation into an independent publicly traded company. The third section, captioned “Risks Related to Our Common Stock,” discusses some of the risks relating to an investment in our Common Stock. You should carefully review all of these sections for important information regarding risks and uncertainties that affect us, in addition to the other information appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition Substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry may harm our business. The global payments industry is highly competitive, and we compete against a wide range of businesses, some of which are larger than we are, have a dominant and secure position, or offer other products and services to consumers and merchants that we do not offer. The global payments industry is rapidly changing, highly innovative and increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny. Many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Competition may also intensify as businesses against which we compete or merchants enter into business combinations and alliances, and established companies in other segments expand to become competitive with our business.We compete against a wide range of businesses with varying roles in all forms of payments, including:•paper-based transactions (principally cash and checks);•providers of traditional payment methods, particularly credit and debit cards and Automated Clearing House transactions (in particular, well-established banks);•payment networks which facilitate payments for credit card users;•providers of “digital wallets” which offer customers the ability to pay online and/or in-store through a variety of payment methods, including with mobile applications, through contactless payments, and with a variety of payment cards;•providers of mobile payments solutions that use tokenized card data approaches and contactless payments (e.g., near field communication (\"NFC\") or host card emulation functionality) to eliminate the need to swipe or insert a card or enter a personal identification number or password;•payment-card processors that offer their services to merchants, including for “card on file” payments where the merchant invites the consumer to select a payment method for their first transaction and to use the same payment method for subsequent transactions;•providers of “person-to-person” payments that facilitate individuals sending money with an email address or mobile phone number;•merchants and merchant associations providing proprietary payment networks to facilitate payments within their own retail network;•money remitters;•providers of card readers for mobile devices and of other point-of-sale and multi-channel technologies; and•providers of virtual currencies and distributed ledger technologies.We often partner with many of these businesses and we consider the ability to continue establishing these partnerships as important to our business. Competition for relationships with these partners is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to establish, grow or maintain these partner relationships.We also face competition and potential competition from:•service providers that provide online merchants the ability to offer their customers the option of paying for purchases from their bank account or paying on credit;•issuers of stored value targeted at online payments;•other global online and mobile payment-services providers;•other providers of online and mobile account-based payments;•services targeting users of social networks and online gaming, including those offering social commerce and peer-to-peer payments;•mobile payment services between bank accounts;•payment services enabling banking customers to send and receive payments through their bank account, including through immediate or real-time payments systems;•ecommerce services that provide special offers linked to a specific payment provider; •services that help merchants accept and manage virtual currencies; and•electronic funds transfer services as a method of payment for both online and offline transactions.Some of these competitors have larger customer bases, volume, scale, resources, and market share than we do, which may provide significant competitive advantages. Some of our competitors may also be subject to less burdensome licensing, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, and other regulatory requirements. They may devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of products and services, and they may offer lower prices or more effectively introduce their own innovative programs, products and services that adversely impact our growth.We compete primarily on the basis of the following:•ability to attract, retain and engage both merchants and consumers;•ability to demonstrate that merchants will achieve incremental sales by offering PayPal services;•consumer confidence in safety and security of transactions on our Payments Platform, including the ability for consumers to use PayPal products and services without sharing their financial information with the merchant or the party they are paying;•simplicity of our fee structure;•ability to develop services across multiple commerce channels, including mobile payments and payments at the retail point of sale;•trust in our dispute resolution and buyer and seller protection programs;•customer service;•brand recognition;•website, mobile platform and application onboarding, ease-of-use, speed, availability, and dependability;•the technology- and payment-agnostic nature of our Payments Platform;•system reliability and data security;•ease and quality of integration into third-party mobile applications and operating systems; and•quality of developer tools, such as our application programming interfaces and software development kits.If we are not able to differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors, drive value for our customers, or effectively align our resources with our goals and objectives, we may not be able to compete effectively against our competitors. Our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threats could materially and adversely harm our business. 11 Table of Contents 12 Table of Contents Substantially all of our net revenues each quarter come primarily from transactions involving payments during that quarter, which may result in significant fluctuations in our operating results that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, as well as the trading price of our common stock. Substantially all of our net revenues each quarter come primarily from transactions involving payments during that quarter. As a result, our operating and financial results have varied on a quarterly basis during our operating history, and may continue to fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including as a result of the risks set forth in this “Risk Factors” section. It is difficult for us to forecast the level or source of our revenues or earnings accurately. In view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful, and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance. Due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting revenues, it is also difficult to forecast expenses as a percentage of net revenues. Quarterly and annual expenses as a percentage of net revenues reflected in our financial statements may be significantly different from historical or projected rates. Our operating results in one or more future quarters may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. The trading price of our common stock may decline significantly as a result of the factors described in this paragraph. Global and regional economic conditions could harm our business. Our operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions. Uncertainty about global and regional economic events and conditions may result in consumers and businesses postponing or lowering spending in response to tighter credit, higher unemployment, financial market volatility, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, government austerity programs, negative financial news, declines in income or asset values, and other factors. These and other global and regional economic events and conditions could have a material adverse impact on the demand for our products and services, including a reduction in the volume and size of transactions on our Payments Platform. In addition, any financial turmoil affecting the banking system or financial markets could cause additional consolidation of the financial services industry, significant financial service institution failures, new or incremental tightening in the credit markets, low liquidity, and extreme volatility or distress in the fixed income, credit, currency and equity markets, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. If we cannot keep pace with rapid technological developments to provide new and innovative products and services, the use of our products and services and, consequently, our revenues could decline. Rapid, significant, and disruptive technological changes impact the industries in which we operate, including developments in payment card tokenization, mobile, social commerce (i.e., ecommerce through social networks), authentication, virtual currencies (including distributed ledger technologies), and NFC and other proximity payment devices, such as contactless payments. We cannot predict the effects of technological changes on our business. In addition to our own initiatives and innovations, we rely in part on third parties, including some of our competitors, for the development of and access to new technologies. We expect that new services and technologies applicable to the industries in which we operate will continue to emerge and may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies we currently use in our products and services. Developing and incorporating new technologies into our products and services may require substantial expenditures, take considerable time, and ultimately may not be successful. In addition, our ability to adopt new products and services and to develop new technologies may be inhibited by industry-wide standards, payments networks, changes to laws and regulations, resistance to change from consumers or merchants, third-party intellectual property rights, or other factors. Our success will depend on our ability to develop and incorporate new technologies and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards; if we are unable to do so in a timely or cost-effective manner, our business could be harmed. Changes in how consumers fund their PayPal transactions could harm our business. We pay transaction fees when consumers fund payment transactions using credit cards, lower fees when consumers fund payments with debit cards, and nominal fees when consumers fund payment transactions by electronic transfer of funds from bank accounts, or from an existing PayPal account balance or through our PayPal Credit products. Our financial success is sensitive to changes in the rate at which our consumers fund payments using credit and debit cards (collectively, “payment cards”), which can significantly increase our costs. Although we provide consumers with the opportunity to use their existing PayPal account balance to fund payment transactions, some of our consumers may prefer to use payment cards, especially if these payment cards offer features and benefits that are not provided as part of their PayPal accounts. An increase in the portion of our payment volume funded using payment cards or in fees associated with our funding mix, or other events or developments that make it more difficult or costly for us to fund transactions with lower-cost funding options, could materially and adversely affect our financial performance and significantly harm our business. We have entered into strategic partnerships with major payment card networks and/or issuing banks to promote greater consumer choice and make it easier for merchants to accept and consumers to pay with these partners’ credit and/or debt cards and to allow us to gain access to these partners’ tokenization services for in-store point of sale PayPal transactions. These arrangements may have an uncertain impact on our business. While we anticipate that these and similar strategic partnerships we may enter into in the future will result in an increase in the number of transactions and transaction volume that we process, we also anticipate that a greater percentage of customer transactions will be executed using a payment card, which would likely increase the transaction costs associated with our funding mix, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. 13 Table of Contents Our business is subject to cyberattacks and security and privacy breaches. Our business involves the collection, storage, processing and transmission of customers’ personal data, including financial information and information about how they interact with our Payments Platform. In addition, a significant number of our customers authorize us to bill their payment card or bank accounts directly for all transaction and other fees charged by us. We have built our reputation on the premise that our Payments Platform offers customers a more secure way to make payments. An increasing number of organizations, including large merchants and businesses, other large technology companies, financial institutions, and government institutions, have disclosed breaches of their information security systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks, including on their websites and infrastructure.The techniques used to obtain unauthorized, improper or illegal access to our systems, our data or customers' data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems are constantly evolving, may be difficult to detect quickly, and often are not recognized until launched against a target. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means, including hacking into our systems or facilities or those of our customers, partners or vendors, or attempting to fraudulently induce (often through spear phishing attacks) our employees, customers, partners, vendors or other users of our systems into disclosing user names, passwords, payment card information, or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems. Certain efforts may be state-sponsored and supported by significant financial and technological resources, making them even more sophisticated and difficult to detect. We believe that PayPal is a particularly attractive target for such breaches and attacks due to our name and brand recognition and the widespread adoption and use of our products and services. Although we have developed systems and processes designed to protect our data and customer data and to prevent data loss and other security breaches, and expect to continue to expend significant resources to bolster these protections, these security measures cannot provide absolute security. Our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyberattacks or security breaches, and third parties may be able to access our customers’ personal or proprietary information and payment card data that are stored on or accessible through those systems. Our security measures may also be breached due to human error, malfeasance, system errors or vulnerabilities, or other irregularities. Actual or perceived breaches of our security could interrupt our operations, result in our systems or services being unavailable, result in improper disclosure of data, materially harm our reputation and brands, result in significant regulatory scrutiny and legal and financial exposure, cause us to incur significant remediation costs, lead to loss of customer confidence in, or decreased use of, our products and services, divert the attention of management from the operation of our business, result in significant compensation or contractual penalties from us to our customers and their business partners as a result of losses to them or claims by them, and adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, any cyberattacks or data security breaches affecting companies that we acquire or our customers, partners or vendors (including data center and cloud computing providers) could have similar negative effects. See Note 3—\"Business Combinations,\" Note 4—\"Goodwill and Intangible Assets\" and Note 13—\"Commitments and Contingencies\" to our consolidated financial statements for disclosure relating to the suspension of operations of TIO Networks (\"TIO\") (which we acquired in July 2017) as part of an ongoing investigation of security vulnerability of the TIO platform. Actual or perceived vulnerabilities or data breaches have led and may lead to claims against us.In addition, under payment card rules and our contracts with our card processors, if there is a breach of payment card information that we store, or that is stored by our direct payment card processing customers, we could be liable to the payment card issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses. We also expect to expend significant additional resources to protect against security or privacy breaches, and may be required to redress problems caused by breaches. Financial services regulators in various jurisdictions, including the U.S. and the EU, have implemented authentication requirements for banks and payment processors intended to reduce online fraud, which could impose significant costs, require us to change our business practices, make it more difficult for new customers to join PayPal, and reduce the ease of use of our products, which could harm our business. Additionally, while we maintain insurance policies, they may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches. 14 Table of Contents Systems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our websites, applications, products or services could harm our business. Our systems and those of our services providers and partners may experience service interruptions or degradation because of hardware and software defects or malfunctions, computer denial-of-service and other cyberattacks, human error, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, natural disasters, power losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist attacks, computer viruses or other malware, or other events. Our systems also may be subject to break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. In addition, as a provider of payments solutions, we are subject to heightened scrutiny by regulators that may require specific business continuity, resiliency and disaster recovery plans, and more rigorous testing of such plans, which may be costly and time-consuming and may divert our resources from other business priorities.We have experienced and expect to continue to experience system failures, denial of service attacks, and other events or conditions from time to time that interrupt the availability, or reduce or adversely affect the speed or functionality of our products and services. These events have resulted and likely will result in loss of revenue. A prolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in the availability, speed or functionality of our products and services could materially harm our business. Frequent or persistent interruptions in our services could cause current or potential customers to believe that our systems are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid or reduce the use of our products and services, and could permanently harm our reputation and brands. Moreover, if any system failure or similar event results in damages to our customers or their business partners, these customers or partners could seek significant compensation or contractual penalties from us for their losses, and those claims, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and costly for us to address, and could have other consequences described in this “Risk Factors” section under the caption “Our business is subject to cyberattacks and security and privacy breaches.”Our Payments Platform has experienced and may in the future experience intermittent unavailability. The full-time availability and expeditious delivery of our products and services is critical to our goal of gaining widespread acceptance among consumers and merchants for digital payments. We have undertaken certain system upgrades and re-platforming efforts designed to improve our reliability and speed. These efforts are costly and time-consuming, involve significant technical risk and may divert our resources from new features and products, and there can be no guarantee that these efforts will succeed. Because we are a regulated financial institution in certain jurisdictions, frequent or persistent site interruptions could lead to regulatory scrutiny, significant fines and penalties, and mandatory and costly changes to our business practices, and ultimately could cause us to lose existing licenses that we need to operate or prevent or delay us from obtaining additional licenses that may be required for our business.We also rely on facilities, components and services supplied by third parties, including data center facilities and cloud storage services. If these third parties cease to provide the facilities or services, experience operational interference or disruptions, breach their agreements with us, or fail to perform their obligations and meet our expectations, our operations could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected, which could result in customer dissatisfaction and damage to our reputation and brands, and materially and adversely affect our business. We do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for all losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of systems failures and similar events.In addition, we are continually improving and upgrading our information systems and technologies. Implementation of new systems and technologies is complex, expensive and time-consuming. If we fail to timely and successfully implement new information systems and technologies, or improvements or upgrades to existing information systems and technologies, or if such systems and technologies do not operate as intended, this could have an adverse impact on our business, internal controls (including internal controls over financial reporting), results of operations and financial condition. Changes to payment card networks or bank fees, rules, or practices could harm our business. We rely on banks or other payment processors to process transactions and pay fees for the services. From time to time, payment card networks have increased, and may increase in the future, the interchange fees and assessments that they charge for each transaction that accesses their networks. Payment card networks have or may impose special fees or assessments for transactions that are executed through a “digital wallet” such as PayPal’s, which could particularly impact us and significantly increase our costs. Our payment card processors may have the right to pass any increases in interchange fees and assessments on to us as well as increase their own fees for processing. Any changes in interchange fees and assessments could increase our operating costs and reduce our operating income. We have entered into strategic partnerships with Visa and Mastercard to further expand our relationships in a way that will make it easier for merchants to accept and consumers to choose to pay with Visa and Mastercard credit and debit cards. During the terms of these agreements, Visa and Mastercard have each agreed to not enact or impose any fees or rules that solely target PayPal. Upon termination of the agreements, PayPal could become subject to special digital wallet fees or other special assessments.In addition, in some jurisdictions, governmental regulations have required payment card networks to reduce interchange fees. Any material change in credit or debit card interchange rates in the U.S. or other markets, including as a result of changes in interchange fee limitations, could adversely affect our competitive position against traditional credit and debit card service providers and our business.We are required by our processors to comply with payment card network operating rules, including special operating rules for payment service providers to merchants. We have agreed to reimburse our processors for any fines they are assessed by payment card networks as a result of any rule violations by us or our merchants. The payment card networks set and interpret the card operating rules. From time to time, the networks have alleged that various aspects of our business model violate these operating rules. If such allegations are not resolved favorably, they may result in significant fines and penalties or require changes in our business practices that may be costly. The payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or re-interpret existing rules that we or our processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow, or costly to implement. As a result, we could lose our ability to give consumers the option of using payment cards to fund their payments or the choice of currency in which they would like their payment card to be charged. If we are unable to accept payment cards or are limited in our ability to do so, our business would be adversely affected.We and our payment card processors have implemented specific business processes for merchants to comply with payment card network operating rules for providing services to merchants. Any failure to comply with these rules could result in fines. We are also subject to fines from payment card networks if we fail to detect that merchants are engaging in activities that are illegal or that are considered “high risk,” including the sale of certain types of digital content. For “high risk” merchants, we must either prevent such merchants from using PayPal services or register such merchants with the payment card networks and conduct additional monitoring with respect to such merchants. Although the amount of these fines has not been material to date, additional fines in the future could become significant and could result in a termination of our ability to accept payment cards or require changes in our process for registering new customers, which would adversely affect our business. Payment card network rules may also increase the cost of, impose restrictions on, or otherwise negatively impact the development of, our retail point-of-sale solutions, which may negatively impact their deployment and adoption. 15 Table of Contents Failure to deal effectively with fraud, fictitious transactions, bad transactions, and negative customer experiences would increase our loss rate and harm our business, and could severely diminish merchant and consumer confidence in and use of our services. In the event that merchants do not fulfill their obligations to consumers or a merchant's goods or services do not match the merchant’s description, we may incur substantial losses as a result of claims from consumers. We seek to recover such losses from the merchant, but may not be able to recover in full if the merchant is unwilling or unable to pay. In addition, in the event of the bankruptcy or other business interruption of a merchant that sells goods or services in advance of the date of their delivery or use (e.g., airline, cruise or concert tickets, custom-made goods and subscriptions), we could be liable to the buyers of such goods or services, either through our buyer protection program or through chargebacks on payment cards used by customers to fund their payment. While we have established reserves based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventualities, these reserves may be insufficient.We also incur substantial losses from claims that the consumer did not authorize the purchase, from customer fraud, from erroneous transactions, and as a result of customers who have closed bank accounts or have insufficient funds in their bank accounts to satisfy payments. In addition, if losses incurred by us related to payment card transactions become excessive, they could potentially result in our losing the right to accept payment cards for payment, which would harm our business. We have taken measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud, but these measures need to be continually improved and may not be effective against fraud, particularly new and continually evolving forms of fraud or in connection with new product offerings. If these measures do not succeed, our business could be harmed. We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We have significant operations internationally that are denominated in foreign currencies, including the British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar, subjecting us to foreign currency risk. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar versus the British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar, and Canadian Dollar impacts the translation of our net revenues generated in these foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar. In connection with providing our services in multiple currencies, we may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the times that we set them. Given that we also hold some corporate and customer funds in non-U.S. currencies, our financial results are affected by the remeasurement of these non-U.S. currencies into U.S. dollars. We also have foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. While we regularly enter into transactions to hedge foreign currency risk for portions of our foreign currency translation and balance sheet exposure, it is impossible to predict or eliminate the effects of this exposure. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could materially and adversely impact our financial results. 16 Table of Contents Any factors that reduce cross-border trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business. Cross-border trade (i.e., transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries) is an important source of our revenue and profits. Cross-border transactions generally provide higher revenues and operating income than similar transactions that take place within a single country or market. Cross-border trade also represents our primary (and in some cases, our only) presence in certain important markets.Cross-border trade is subject to, and may be negatively impacted by, foreign exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, the interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions (e.g., the jurisdiction of the merchant and of the consumer) are often extremely complicated in the context of cross-border trade. Changes to or the interpretation and/or application of laws and regulations applicable to cross-border trade could impose additional requirements and restrictions, impose conflicting obligations, and increase the costs associated with cross-border trade. Any factors that increase the costs of cross-border trade for us or our customers or that restrict, delay, or make cross-border trade more difficult or impractical would lower our revenues and profits and could harm our business. The United Kingdom’s departure from the EU could adversely affect us. The United Kingdom (“U.K.”) held a referendum in June 2016 in which a majority of voters approved an exit from the EU (“Brexit”). In March 2017, the U.K. invoked Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, which triggered a two-year period, with extension subject to unanimous consent by the other EU member states, during which the U.K. government will negotiate its withdrawal agreement with the EU. Brexit could adversely affect U.K., regional (including European), and worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the British Pound and Euro, which in turn could adversely affect our customers and companies with which we do business, particularly in the U.K. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and see national laws and regulations in the U.K. diverge from EU laws and regulations, as the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. In particular, depending on the terms of Brexit, we may face new regulatory costs and challenges, including the following:•we could lose our ability for our EU operations to offer services on a cross-border basis into the U.K. market utilizing regulatory permissions of PayPal (Europe) S.à r.l. et Cie, SCA (“PayPal (Europe)”), our wholly-owned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a credit institution in Luxembourg, and our corresponding ability to work with the Luxembourg regulators as the lead authority for various aspects of our U.K. operations;•we could be required to obtain additional regulatory permissions to operate in the U.K. market, adding costs and potential inconsistency to our business (and, depending on the capacity of the U.K. authorities, the criteria for obtaining permission, and any possible transitional arrangements, there is a risk that our business in the U.K. could be materially affected or disrupted); •we could be required to comply with regulatory requirements in the U.K. that are in addition to, or inconsistent with, the regulatory requirements of the EU; and•our ability to attract and retain the necessary human resources in appropriate locations to support the U.K. business and the EU business of PayPal could be adversely impacted.Any of the effects of Brexit described above and others that we cannot anticipate could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight, as well as extensive, complex, overlapping and frequently changing rules, regulations and legal interpretations. Our business is subject to laws, rules, regulations, policies, and legal interpretations in the markets in which we operate, including, but not limited to, those governing banking, credit, deposit taking, cross-border and domestic money transmission, foreign exchange, privacy, data protection, cybersecurity, banking secrecy, payment services (including payment processing and settlement services), consumer protection, economic and trade sanctions, anti-money laundering, and counter-terrorist financing. The legal and regulatory requirements applicable to us are extensive, complex, frequently changing, and increasing in number, and may impose overlapping and/or conflicting requirements or obligations.Financial and political events have increased the level of regulatory scrutiny on the payments industry, and regulatory agencies may view matters or interpret laws and regulations differently than they have in the past and in a manner adverse to our business. Our success and increased visibility may result in increased regulatory oversight and tighter enforcement of rules and regulations that may apply to our business.As we expand and localize our international activities, we are increasingly becoming obligated to comply with the laws of the countries or markets in which we operate. In addition, because our services are accessible worldwide and we facilitate sales of goods and provide services to customers worldwide, one or more jurisdictions may claim that we or our customers are required to comply with their laws. Laws regulating the Internet, mobile and related technologies outside of the U.S. often impose different, more specific, or even conflicting obligations on us, as well as broader liability. For example, certain transactions that may be permissible in a local jurisdiction may be prohibited by regulations of U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) or U.S. anti-money laundering or counter-terrorist financing regulations.Any failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or new laws, regulations or orders of any governmental authority (including changes to or expansion of the interpretation of those laws, regulations or orders), including those discussed in this risk factor, may subject us to significant fines, penalties, criminal and civil lawsuits, forfeiture of significant assets, and enforcement actions in one or more jurisdictions, result in additional compliance and licensure requirements, increase regulatory scrutiny of our business, restrict our operations, and force us to change our business practices, make product or operational changes or delay planned product launches or improvements. Any of the foregoing could, individually or in the aggregate, damage our brands and business, and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The complexity of U.S. federal and state regulatory and enforcement regimes, coupled with the global scope of our operations and the evolving global regulatory environment, could result in a single event giving rise to a large number of overlapping investigations and legal and regulatory proceedings by multiple government authorities in different jurisdictions. We have implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws, and regulations, but there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations. 17 Table of Contents Payments Regulation In the U.S., PayPal, Inc. has obtained licenses to operate as a money transmitter (or its equivalent) in the states where it is required, as well as in the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. These licenses include not only the PayPal branded products and services in these states, but also our Braintree, Venmo, Xoom and TIO branded products and services. As a licensed money transmitter, PayPal is subject to restrictions with respect to the investment of customer funds, reporting requirements, bonding requirements and inspection by state regulatory agencies. Accordingly, if we violate these laws or regulations, we could be subject to liability and/or additional restrictions, forced to cease doing business with residents of certain states, forced to change our business practices or required to obtain additional licenses or regulatory approvals, which could impose substantial costs.While we currently allow our customers with payment cards to send payments from approximately 200 markets, we allow customers in only approximately half of those markets (including the U.S.) to also receive payments, in some cases with significant restrictions on the manner in which customers can withdraw funds. These limitations may adversely affect our ability to grow our business in these markets. We provide our services to customers in the EU through PayPal (Europe), our wholly-owned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a credit institution in Luxembourg. Accordingly, PayPal (Europe) is subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if it violates the disclosure, reporting, anti-money laundering, capitalization, fund management, corporate governance, privacy, data protection, information security, banking secrecy, taxation, sanctions, or other requirements imposed on Luxembourg banks. In addition, EU laws and regulations are typically subject to different and potentially inconsistent interpretations by the countries that are members of the EU, which can make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage. Moreover, the countries that are EU members may each have different and potentially inconsistent domestic regulations implementing European Directives, including the EU Payment Services Directive and the E-Money Directive, which could make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage. The Revised Payment Services Directive (“PSD2”) entered into force in January 2016 and is in the process of being implemented into national legislation, with certain requirements effective January 13, 2018. The implementation of the PSD2 may negatively affect our business. PSD2 seeks to enable new payment models whereby a newly formed category of regulated payment provider would be able to access bank and payment accounts (including PayPal accounts) for the purposes of accessing account information or initiating a payment on behalf of a customer. Such access could subject us to data security and other legal and financial risks and could create new competitive forces and new types of competitors in the European payments market. PSD2 seeks to regulate more online platforms that handle payments for their sellers. PayPal merchants with affected business models which are not licensed, or which do not benefit from exemptions or integrate a compliant marketplaces solution may not be able to offer PayPal products in the future. PSD2 also imposes new standards for payment security and strong customer authentication that may make it more difficult and time consuming to carry out a PayPal transaction, which may adversely impact PayPal’s customer value proposition and its European business.Finally, if the business activities of PayPal (Europe) exceed certain thresholds, or if the European Central Bank (“ECB”) determines that PayPal (Europe) is a significant supervised entity or that some activity of PayPal (Europe) is deemed subject to oversight by the ECB, PayPal (Europe) could become directly regulated by the ECB in addition to the Luxembourg regulator, the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (the \"CSSF\"), as its national supervisor, which could subject us to additional requirements and would likely increase compliance costs.In Australia, we serve our customers through PayPal Australia Pty. Ltd. (“PayPal Australia”), which is licensed by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission as a provider of a non-cash payment product and by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority as a purchased payment facility provider, which is a type of authorized depository institution. Accordingly, PayPal Australia is subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if it violates the product disclosure, reporting, anti-money laundering, capital requirements, privacy, corporate governance or other requirements imposed on Australian depository institutions.In Hong Kong, we serve our customers through PayPal Hong Kong Limited (“PayPal Hong Kong”), which is licensed by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority as an issuer of stored value facility (“SVF Licensee”). Accordingly, PayPal Hong Kong is subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if it violates the reporting, anti-money laundering, capital requirements, privacy, corporate governance, risk management, float management, and/or any other requirements imposed on SVF Licensees.In many of the other markets in which we do business, we serve our customers through PayPal Pte. Ltd., our wholly-owned subsidiary based in Singapore. PayPal Pte. Ltd. is supervised by the Monetary Authority of Singapore and designated as a holder of a stored value facility, but does not hold a remittance license. As a result, PayPal Pte. Ltd. is not able to offer outbound remittance payments (including donations to charities) from Singapore, and can only offer payments for the purchase of goods and services in Singapore. In many of the markets (other than Singapore) served by PayPal Pte. Ltd., it is unclear and uncertain whether our Singapore-based service is subject only to Singapore law or, if it is subject to the application of local laws, whether such local laws would require a payment processor like us to be licensed as a payments service, bank, financial institution or otherwise.We are also subject to regulation in other markets in which we do business, and we have been and expect to continue to be required to apply for various licenses, certifications and regulatory approvals in a number of the countries where we provide our services. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such licenses, certifications, and approvals. In addition, there are substantial costs and potential product changes involved in maintaining such licenses, certifications, and approvals, and we could be subject to fines or other enforcement action if we are found to violate disclosure, reporting, anti-money laundering, capitalization, corporate governance or other requirements of such licenses. These factors could impose substantial additional costs and involve considerable delay to the development or provision of our products or services, or could require significant and costly operational changes or prevent us from providing our products or services in a given market.In many countries, it may not be clear whether we are required to be licensed as a payment services provider, bank, financial institution or otherwise. In such markets, we may rely on local banks to process payments and conduct foreign exchange transactions in local currency. Local regulators may use their power to slow or halt payments to local merchants conducted through local banks or otherwise prohibit us from doing business in a country. Such regulatory actions or the need to obtain licenses, certifications or other regulatory approvals could impose substantial costs, involve considerable delay to the provision or development of our services, require significant and costly operational changes, impose restrictions, limitations, or additional requirements on our business, or prevent us from providing any products or services in a given market. 18 Table of Contents Consumer Protection The financial services sector is subject to significant regulation and we are subject to consumer protection laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. In the U.S., we are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations applicable to our activities, including the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (“EFTA”) and Regulation E as implemented by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). These regulations require us to provide advance disclosure of changes to our services, follow specified error resolution procedures, and reimburse consumers for losses from certain transactions not authorized by the consumer, among other requirements. Additionally, technical violations of consumer protection laws could result in the assessment of actual damages or statutory damages or penalties of up to $1,000 in individual cases or up to $500,000 per violation in any class action and treble damages in some instances; we could also be liable for plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees in such cases. We are subject to, and have paid amounts in settlement of, lawsuits containing allegations that our business violated the EFTA and Regulation E or otherwise advance claims for relief relating to our business practices (e.g., that we improperly held consumer funds or otherwise improperly limited consumer accounts).In October 2016, the CFPB issued a final rule on prepaid accounts. The rule’s definition of prepaid account includes certain accounts that are capable of being loaded with funds and whose primary function is to conduct transactions with multiple, unaffiliated merchants, at ATMs and/or for person-to-person transfers, including certain digital wallets. The rule’s requirements include: the disclosure of fees and other information to the consumer prior to the creation of a prepaid account; the extension of Regulation E liability limits and error-resolution requirements to all prepaid accounts; the application of Regulation Z credit card requirements to prepaid accounts with overdraft and credit features; and the submission of prepaid account agreements to the CFPB and their publication to the general public. In April 2017, the CFPB delayed the effective date of the final rule on prepaid accounts to April 1, 2018, and indicated that it would review, among other issues, the linking of credit cards to digital wallets that are capable of storing funds. In June 2017, the CFPB released proposed changes to its final rule, and in January 2018, the CFPB issued its final rule,with an effective date of April 1, 2019. We are evaluating the final rule and its requirements. Implementation of the rule could require us to make substantial changes to our business practices and the design of certain products, allocate additional resources, and increase our costs, which could negatively affect our business.In May 2015, we entered into a Stipulated Final Judgment and Consent Order (“Consent Order”) with the CFPB in which we settled regulatory claims arising from PayPal Credit practices between 2011 and 2015. The Consent Order included obligations on PayPal to pay $15 million in redress to consumers and a $10 million civil monetary penalty, and required PayPal to make various changes to PayPal Credit disclosures and related business practices. We continue to cooperate and engage with the CFPB and work to ensure compliance with the Consent Order, which may result in us incurring additional costs.PayPal (Europe) principally offers its services in EU countries through a “passport” notification process through the Luxembourg regulator to regulators in other EU member states pursuant to EU regulation. Regulators in these countries could notify PayPal (Europe) of local consumer protection laws that apply to its business, in addition to Luxembourg consumer protection law, and could also seek to persuade the Luxembourg regulator to order PayPal (Europe) to conduct its or the PayPal group's activities in the local country directly or through a branch office. These or similar actions by these regulators could increase the cost of, or delay, our plans to expand our business in EU countries. 19 Table of Contents Economic and Trade Sanctions We are required to comply with U.S. economic and trade sanctions administered by OFAC. We have self-reported to OFAC certain transactions that were inadvertently processed but subsequently identified as possible violations of U.S. economic and trade sanctions. In March 2015, we reached a settlement with OFAC regarding possible violations arising from our sanctions compliance practices between 2009 and 2013, prior to the implementation of our real-time transaction scanning program. Subsequently, we have self-reported additional transactions as possible violations, and we have received new subpoenas from OFAC seeking additional information about certain of these transactions. Such self-reported transactions could result in claims or actions against us, including litigation, injunctions, damage awards, fines or penalties, or require us to change our business practices in a manner that could result in a material loss, require significant management time, result in the diversion of significant operational resources or otherwise harm our business. Furthermore, compliance with economic and trade sanctions in force in one jurisdiction may conflict with the laws and regulations of other jurisdictions in which we operate and can expose us to the risk of fines, sanctions and penalties. Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing We are subject to various anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws and regulations around the world that prohibit, among other things, our involvement in transferring the proceeds of criminal activities. U.S. and other regulators globally continue to increase their scrutiny of compliance with these obligations, which may require us to further revise or expand our compliance program, including the procedures we use to verify the identity of our customers and to monitor international and domestic transactions. Many countries in which we operate also have anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws and regulations, and we have been and will continue to be required to make changes to our compliance program in various jurisdictions in response. Regulators regularly re-examine the transaction volume thresholds at which we must obtain and keep applicable records or verify identities of customers and any change in such thresholds could result in greater costs for compliance. In the EU, the implementation of the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive and the regulation on information accompanying transfer of funds (commonly known as the Revised Wire Transfer Regulation) are expected to make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage, lead to increased friction for customers, and result in a decrease in business. As of December 2017, PayPal (Europe)’s home state, Luxembourg, had not yet implemented all of the provisions of the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive and there is uncertainty as to the exact requirements with which PayPal (Europe) will be required to comply. Penalties for non-compliance with the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive could include fines of up to 10% of PayPal (Europe)’s total annual turnover. EU institutions are also proposing changes to the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive which could be even more stringent. 20 Table of Contents Privacy and Protection of User Data We are subject to a number of laws, rules, directives and regulations (which we refer to as “privacy laws”) relating to the collection, use, retention, security, processing and transfer (which we refer to as “process”) of personally identifiable information about our customers and employees (which we refer to as “personal data”) in the countries where we operate. Much of the personal data that we process, especially financial information, is regulated by multiple privacy laws and, in some cases, the privacy laws of multiple jurisdictions. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between or among us, our subsidiaries, and other parties with which we have commercial relationships.Regulatory scrutiny of privacy, data protection, and the collection, use and sharing of data is increasing around the world. There is uncertainty associated with the legal and regulatory environment relating to privacy and data protection laws, which continue to develop in ways we cannot predict, including with respect to evolving technologies such as cloud computing. Privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and impose inconsistent or conflicting requirements. Complying with varying jurisdictional requirements could increase the costs and complexity of compliance or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business, and violations of privacy and data protection-related laws may expose us to significant damage awards, fines and other penalties that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business and reputation. In addition, compliance with inconsistent privacy laws may restrict our ability to provide products and services to our customers.PayPal relies on a variety of compliance methods to transfer personal data of EU citizens to the U.S., including reliance on Binding Corporate Rules (“BCRs”) for internal transfers of certain types of personal data and Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”) as approved by the European Commission for transfers to and from third parties. PayPal must also ensure that third parties processing personal data of PayPal’s EU customers and/or employees outside of the EU have compliant transfer mechanisms. In October 2015, the European Court of Justice invalidated U.S.-EU Safe Harbor framework clauses that were previously relied upon by some PayPal vendors to lawfully transfer personal data of EU citizens to U.S. companies, and PayPal entered into SCCs with those third parties who had previously relied on the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor framework. In July 2016, the U.S. and EU authorities agreed on a replacement for Safe Harbor known as “Privacy Shield.” Both the Privacy Shield framework and SCCs are facing legal challenges in the European justice system. To the extent that the Privacy Shield or SCCs are invalidated, PayPal’s ability to process EU personal data with third parties outside of the EU could be jeopardized.In 2016, the EU adopted a comprehensive overhaul of its data protection regime from the current national legislative approach to a single European Economic Area Privacy Regulation, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which comes into effect in May 2018. The proposed EU data protection regime expands the scope of the EU data protection law to all foreign companies processing personal data of EU residents, imposes a strict data protection compliance regime with severe penalties of up to the greater of 4% of worldwide turnover and €20 million, and includes new rights such as the “portability” of personal data. Although the GDPR will apply across the EU without a need for local implementing legislation, local data protection authorities (“DPAs”) will still have the ability to interpret the GDPR through so-called opening clauses, which permit region-specific data protection legislation and have the potential to create inconsistencies on a country-by-country basis. We are evaluating the rule and its requirements. Implementation of the GDPR could require us to change our business practices and increase the costs and complexity of compliance.PayPal also faces additional potential challenges from local DPAs. Because PayPal (Europe) is headquartered in Luxembourg and subject to regulation as a bank in that jurisdiction, we have relied on the “one-stop-shop” concept under which Luxembourg has been our lead data protection regulator in the EU. However, a 2015 European Court of Justice ruling (Weltimmo) affecting companies that do business in the EU potentially could make us subject to the local data protection laws or regulatory enforcement activities of the various EU member states in which we have established legal entities and which apply privacy laws that are different than, and may conflict with, Luxembourg privacy laws.In addition, because of the large number of text messages, emails, phone calls and other communications we send or make to our customers for various business purposes, communication-related privacy laws that provide a specified monetary damage award or fine for each violation could result in particularly significant damage awards or fines. For example, under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”), in the U.S., plaintiffs may seek actual monetary loss or statutory damages of $500 per violation, whichever is greater, and courts may treble the damage award for willful or knowing violations. We have been, and may continue to be subject to lawsuits (including class-action lawsuits) containing allegations that our business violated the TCPA. These lawsuits seek damages (including statutory damages) and injunctive relief, among other remedies. Given the large number of communications we send to our customers, a determination that there have been violations of the TCPA or other communications-based statutes could expose us to significant damage awards that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business.Data protection, privacy and information security have become the subject of increasing public, media, regulatory and legislative concern. We post on our websites and applications our privacy policies and practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of user data. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies, with any applicable regulatory requirements or orders, or with privacy, data protection, information security or consumer protection-related laws and regulations in one or more jurisdictions could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, including class action privacy litigation in certain jurisdictions, subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments and negative publicity, require us to change our business practices, increase the costs and complexity of compliance, and adversely affect our business. As noted above, we are also subject to the possibility of security and privacy breaches, which themselves may result in a violation of privacy laws. 21 Table of Contents If one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their financial or performance obligations to us or fail, we may incur significant losses. We have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the U.S. and abroad. As part of our currency hedging activities, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments with various financial institutions. Certain banks and financial institutions are also lenders under our credit facilities. We regularly monitor our exposure to counterparty credit risk, and actively manage this exposure to mitigate the associated risk. Despite these efforts, we may be exposed to the risk of default by, or deteriorating operating results or financial condition or failure of, these counterparty financial institutions. The risk of counterparty default, deterioration or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets. If one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or to access or recover our assets that are deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty’s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties, we could incur significant losses, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. PayPal is not a bank or licensed lender in the U.S. and relies upon third parties to make loans and provide other products critical to our business. As PayPal is neither a chartered financial institution nor licensed to make loans in any state in the U.S., we rely on a third-party chartered financial institution to issue the PayPal Credit consumer product in the U.S., and different chartered financial institutions to issue the PayPal Working Capital product and other business loan products in the U.S. These chartered financial institutions are state chartered industrial banks. Any termination or interruption in a partner bank’s ability to lend could result in us being unable or unwilling to offer our consumer and business loan products, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to issue our loan products in the U.S. and our business. In the event of a partner bank’s inability or unwillingness to lend, we may need to reach a similar agreement with another chartered financial institution or obtain our own bank charter or lending licenses. We may be unable to reach a similar agreement with another partner on favorable terms or at all, and obtaining a bank charter or lending licenses would be a costly, time-consuming and uncertain process, subject us to additional laws and regulatory requirements, which could be burdensome, increase our costs and require us to change our business practices. In addition, as a service provider to these bank partners, which are federally supervised U.S. financial institutions, we are subject from time to time to examination by their federal banking regulators.A case decided in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, Madden v. Midland Funding, LLC (786 F.3d 246 (2d Cir. 2015)), resulted in some uncertainty as to whether non-bank entities purchasing loans originated by a bank may rely on federal preemption of state usury laws, and may create an increased risk of litigation by plaintiffs challenging our ability to collect interest and fees in accordance with the terms of certain loans. Although the decision specifically addressed preemption under the National Bank Act, this decision could support future challenges to federal preemption for other institutions, including FDIC-insured, state chartered industrial banks like those that we rely on to issue our loan products in the U.S. After the Madden decision, there continue to be a number of U.S. state and federal court legal actions challenging the viability of business models where a non-bank entity relies on a third party chartered financial institution in connection with the issuance of credit products. While we believe the manner in which we offer our credit products can be distinguished from Madden, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of any potential litigation, which could materially and adversely impact our ability to issue our loan products in the U.S. and our business. On November 16, 2017, we announced an arrangement under which Synchrony Bank will acquire the U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio held by us and certain of our affiliates, which totaled approximately $6.4 billion in receivables as of December 31, 2017. The purchase price is subject to a post-closing true-up and certain adjustments. The transaction is expected to be completed during the third quarter of 2018, subject to certain closing conditions. The transaction may not close within the expected timeframe or at all. Even if the transaction is consummated, it may take us longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction, and those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Under our expanded program agreement with Synchrony Bank, at the closing of the consumer credit receivables portfolio sale, Synchrony Bank will become the exclusive issuer of the PayPal Credit online consumer financing program in the U.S. for a 10-year term, and we retain an option to designate a purchaser of the portfolio at the end of that term, Our increased reliance on Synchrony will subject us to risks in the nature of those discussed in this “Risk Factors” section under the caption \"We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk.\" 22 Table of Contents Our credit products expose us to additional risks. We offer our PayPal Credit consumer product and PayPal Working Capital and other business loan products to a wide range of consumers and merchants in various markets, and the financial success of these products depends on the effective management of related risk. The credit decisioning process for our PayPal Credit consumer product uses proprietary segmentation and credit algorithms and other analytical techniques designed to analyze the credit risk of specific consumers based on their past purchasing and payment history with PayPal as well as their credit scores. Similarly proprietary risk models and other indicators are applied to assess merchants who wish to use our business loan products to help predict their ability to repay. These risk models may not accurately predict the creditworthiness of a consumer or merchant due to factors such as inaccurate assumptions, including assumptions related to the particular consumer or merchant, market conditions, economic environment or limited transaction history or other data, among other factors. The accuracy of these risk models and the ability to manage credit risk related to our credit products may also be affected by legal or regulatory requirements, competitors’ actions, changes in consumer behavior, changes in the economic environment and other factors. Our international expansion of our credit product offerings also exposes us to additional risks, including those discussed below under the risk factor titled “Our international operations are subject to increased risks, which could harm our business.”Like other businesses with significant exposure to losses from consumer and merchant credit, we face the risk that account holders will default on their payment obligations, creating the risk of potential charge-offs. The non-payment rate among account holders may increase due to, among other things, changes to underwriting standards, worsening economic conditions, such as a recession or government austerity programs, increases in prevailing interest rates, and high unemployment rates. Account holders who miss payments often fail to repay their loans, and account holders who file for protection under the bankruptcy laws generally do not repay their loans.We currently purchase receivables related to our credit products in the U.S. If we are unable to fund our purchase of these receivables adequately or in a cost-effective manner, or if we are unable to efficiently manage the cash resources utilized for these purposes, our business could be harmed. Our business may be impacted by political events, war, terrorism, public health issues, natural disasters and other business interruptions. War, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, public health issues, natural disasters and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to the economy and commerce on a global or regional basis, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, our customers, and companies with which we do business. Our business operations are subject to interruption by, among others, natural disasters, fire, power shortages, earthquakes, floods, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond our control. Such events could decrease demand for our products and services or make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products and services to our customers. In the event of a natural disaster, we could incur significant losses, require substantial recovery time and experience significant expenditures in order to resume or maintain operations, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Changes to our buyer and seller protection programs could increase our loss rate. Our buyer and seller protection programs protect merchants and consumers from fraudulent transactions, and consumers if they do not receive the item ordered or if the item received is significantly different from its description. In 2015, we increased the scope of our buyer protection program to cover digital goods and intangible goods and services. In addition, consumers who pay through PayPal may have reimbursement rights from their payment card issuer (usually a bank), which in turn will seek recovery from us. The risk of losses from our buyer and seller protection programs are specific to individual buyers, sellers and transactions, and may also be impacted by regional variations to these programs, modifications to these programs resulting from changes in regulatory requirements, or changes that we decide to implement, such as expanding the scope of transactions covered by one or more of these programs. Upon PayPal becoming an independent publicly traded company in July 2015, we extended our protection programs in several countries to cover certain customers’ purchases on eBay, and our costs associated with these programs have therefore increased. Increases in our loss rate, including as a result of changing our buyer and seller protection programs, could harm our business. 23 Table of Contents Our international operations are subject to increased risks, which could harm our business. Our international operations have generated approximately one-half of our net revenues in recent years. There are risks inherent in doing business internationally on both a domestic (i.e., in-country) and cross-border basis, including:•foreign currency and cross-border trade risks discussed earlier in this “Risk Factors” section under the captions “We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates” and “Any factors that reduce cross-border trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business”;•risks related to other government regulation or required compliance with local laws;•local licensing and reporting obligations (e.g., data localization requirements);•expenses associated with localizing our products and services, including offering customers the ability to transact business in the local currency, and adapting our products and services to local preferences (e.g., payment methods) with which we may have limited or no experience;•trade barriers and changes in trade regulations;•difficulties in developing, staffing, and simultaneously managing a large number of varying foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences;•stringent local labor laws and regulations;•credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;•profit repatriation restrictions, foreign currency exchange restrictions or extreme fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for a particular currency;•political or social unrest, economic instability, repression, or human rights issues;•geopolitical events, including natural disasters, public health issues, acts of war, and terrorism;•import or export regulations;•compliance with U.S. laws and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, and other local anticorruption laws;•compliance with U.S. and foreign laws designed to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities;•antitrust and competition regulations;•potentially adverse tax developments and consequences;•economic uncertainties relating to sovereign and other debt;•national or regional differences in macroeconomic growth rates;•different, uncertain, overlapping, or more stringent user protection, data protection, privacy, and other laws and regulations; and•increased difficulties in collecting accounts receivable.Violations of the complex foreign and U.S. laws, rules and regulations that apply to our international operations may result in fines, criminal actions, or sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies. These risks are inherent in our international operations and expansion, may increase our costs of doing business internationally, and could harm our business. We are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates. We are exposed to interest rate risk from our investment portfolio and from interest-rate sensitive assets underlying the customer balances we hold on our balance sheet as customer accounts. A low interest rate environment or reductions in interest rates may negatively impact our investment income and our net income. In addition, fluctuations in interest rates may adversely impact our customers’ spending levels and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amounts owed to us. Higher interest rates often lead to higher payment obligations by customers to us and other lenders under mortgage, credit card and other consumer and merchant loans, which may reduce our customers’ ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore lead to increased delinquencies, charge-offs and allowance for loan and interest receivable which could have an adverse effect on our net income.We have entered into a revolving credit facility and a 364-day delayed-draw term loan credit facility. We have borrowed under these credit facilities from time to time, and any borrowings under these credit facilities bear interest at a floating rate, exposing us to interest rate fluctuations. 24 Table of Contents Use of our payments services for illegal purposes could harm our business. Our payment system is susceptible to potentially illegal or improper uses, including money laundering, terrorist financing, illegal online gambling, fraudulent sales of goods or services, illegal sales of prescription medications or controlled substances, piracy of software, movies, music, and other copyrighted or trademarked goods (in particular, digital goods), bank fraud, child pornography trafficking, prohibited sales of alcoholic beverages or tobacco products, online securities fraud, or to facilitate other illegal activity. Any use of our payment system for illegal or improper uses could subject us to claims, individual and class action lawsuits, and government and regulatory investigations, inquiries or requests that could result in liability and reputational harm for us. Moreover, certain activity that may be legal in one country may be illegal in another country, and a merchant may intentionally or inadvertently be found responsible for importing or exporting illegal goods, resulting in liability for us. Changes in law have increased the penalties for intermediaries providing payment services for certain illegal activities, and government authorities may consider additional payments-related proposals from time to time. Owners of intellectual property rights or government authorities may seek to bring legal action against providers of payments solutions, including PayPal, that are peripherally involved in the sale of infringing or allegedly infringing items. Any threatened or resulting claims could result in reputational harm, and any resulting liabilities, loss of transaction volume or increased costs could harm our business. Our failure to manage our customer funds and the assets underlying our customer funds properly could harm our business. We hold a substantial amount of funds belonging to our customers, including deposits in customer accounts and funds being remitted to sellers of goods and services. In certain jurisdictions where we operate, we are required to hold eligible liquid assets, as defined by the relevant regulators in each jurisdiction, equal to at least 100% of the aggregate amount of all customer balances. Our ability to manage and account accurately for the assets underlying our customer funds and comply with applicable liquid asset requirements requires a high level of internal controls. As our business continues to grow and we expand our product offerings, we must continue to strengthen our associated internal controls. PayPal (Europe), with the permission of the CSSF, utilizes certain European customer balances held by our Luxembourg banking subsidiary to fund credit balances relating to our customers. Our success requires significant public confidence in our ability to properly manage our customers’ balances and handle large and growing transaction volumes and amounts of customer funds. Any failure to maintain the necessary controls or to manage our customer funds and the assets underlying our customer funds accurately and in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements could result in reputational harm, lead customers to discontinue or reduce their use of our products and result in significant penalties and fines, which could materially harm our business. We are subject to regulatory activity and antitrust litigation under competition laws. We are subject to scrutiny by various government agencies under U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including antitrust and competition laws. An increasing number of jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. Other companies and government agencies have in the past and may in the future allege that our actions violate the antitrust or competition laws of the U.S., individual states, other countries, or the European Commission, or otherwise constitute unfair competition. An increasing number of governments are regulating and increasing their scrutiny of competition law activities. Our business agreements or arrangements with customers or other companies could give rise to regulatory action or antitrust litigation. Some regulators, particularly those outside of the U.S., may perceive that our products and services are used so broadly that otherwise uncontroversial business practices could be deemed anticompetitive. Any claims or investigations, even if without merit, may be very expensive to defend or respond to, involve negative publicity and substantial diversion of management time and effort, and could result in reputational harm, significant judgments against us, or require us to change our business practices. We are subject to patent litigation. We have repeatedly been sued for allegedly infringing other parties’ patents. At any given time, we are typically a defendant in a number of patent lawsuits and have been notified of several other potential patent disputes. We expect that we will continue to be subject to patent infringement claims because, among other reasons:•our products and services continue to expand in scope and complexity;•we continue to expand into new business areas, including through acquisitions; and•the number of patent owners who may claim that we, any of the companies that we have acquired, or our customers infringe their patents, and the aggregate number of patents controlled by such patent owners, continues to increase.Such claims may be brought directly against us or against our customers whom we may indemnify because we are contractually obligated to do so or we choose to do so as a business matter. We believe that many of the claims against us and other technology companies have been, and continue to be, initiated by third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims. In addition, we have seen significant patent disputes between operating companies in some technology industries. Patent claims, whether meritorious or not, are time-consuming and costly to defend and resolve, and could require us to make expensive changes in our methods of doing business, enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements, make substantial payments to satisfy adverse judgments or settle claims or proceedings, or cease conducting certain operations, which would harm our business. 25 Table of Contents We may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or third parties may allege that we are infringing their intellectual property rights. The protection of our intellectual property, including our trademarks, patents, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, and trade secrets, is important to the success of our business. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on applicable laws and regulations in the U.S. and internationally, as well as a variety of administrative procedures. We also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights when offering or procuring products and services, including confidentiality and invention assignment agreements entered into with our employees and contractors and confidentiality agreements with parties with whom we conduct business.Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we offer our products and services. We may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our rights. Although we have generally taken measures to protect our intellectual property rights, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in protecting or enforcing our rights in every jurisdiction, or that contractual arrangements and other steps that we have taken to protect our intellectual property will prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our intellectual property or deter independent development of equivalent or superior intellectual property rights by others. If we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting, registering or using trademarks and trade dress that infringe, dilute or otherwise violate our trademark rights, the value of our brands could be diminished and our business could be adversely affected. Also, we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. We have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to others. These licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation. Any failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or significant costs incurred in doing so, could diminish the value of our intangible assets and materially harm our business.As the number of products in the technology and payments industries increases and the functionality of these products further overlaps, and as we acquire technology through acquisitions or licenses, we may become increasingly subject to intellectual property infringement and other claims. Litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of the patent and other intellectual property rights of others. The ultimate outcome of any allegation is often uncertain and, regardless of the outcome, any such claim, with or without merit, may be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert management’s time and attention from our business, and require us to, among other things, redesign or stop providing our products or services, pay substantial amounts to satisfy judgments or settle claims or lawsuits, pay substantial royalty or licensing fees, or satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with certain parties with whom we have commercial relationships. Our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights, or litigation or claims arising out of intellectual property matters, may harm our business. We are regularly subject to general litigation, regulatory disputes, and government inquiries. We are regularly subject to claims, individual and class action lawsuits, government and regulatory investigations, inquiries or requests, and other proceedings alleging violations of laws, rules and regulations with respect to competition, antitrust, intellectual property, privacy, data protection, information security, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, sanctions, anti-corruption, consumer protection, fraud, accessibility, securities, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, services, charitable fundraising, contract disputes, escheatment of unclaimed or abandoned property, and other matters. In particular, our business faces ongoing consumer protection and intellectual property litigation, as discussed above. The number and significance of these disputes and inquiries have increased as our business has expanded in scale, scope and geographic reach, and our products and services have increased in complexity. In addition, the laws, rules and regulations affecting our business, including those pertaining to Internet and mobile commerce, payments services, and credit, are subject to ongoing interpretation by the courts and governmental authorities, and the resulting uncertainty in the scope and application of these laws, rules and regulations increases the risk that we will be subject to private claims and governmental actions alleging violations.The scope, outcome and impact of claims, lawsuits, government investigations, and proceedings to which we are subject cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of the outcome, such investigations and proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of management resources, reputational damage, and other factors. Determining reserves for our pending litigation and regulatory proceedings is a complex, fact-intensive process that involves a high degree of judgment. Resolving one or more such legal and regulatory proceedings could potentially require us to make substantial payments to satisfy judgments, fines or penalties or to settle claims or proceedings, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business. These proceedings could also result in reputational harm, criminal sanctions, consent decrees, or orders that prevent us from offering certain products or services, require us to change our business practices in costly ways or develop non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies. Any of these consequences could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.While certain of our customer agreements contain arbitration provisions with class action waiver provisions that may limit our exposure to consumer class action litigation, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in enforcing these arbitration provisions, including the class action waiver provisions, in the future or in any given case. Legislative, administrative or regulatory developments may directly or indirectly prohibit or limit the use of pre-dispute arbitration clauses and class action waiver provisions. Any such prohibitions or limitations on or discontinuation of the use of, such arbitration or class action waiver provisions could subject us to additional lawsuits, including additional consumer class action litigation, and significantly limit our ability to avoid exposure from consumer class action litigation. 26 Table of Contents Changes in U.S. tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations and financial conditions. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive Federal tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act makes changes to the corporate tax rate, business-related deductions and taxation of foreign earnings, among others, that will generally be effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. These changes could have a material adverse impact on the value of our U.S. deferred tax assets, result in significant one-time charges in the current or future taxable years and increase our future U.S. tax expense. We are continuing to evaluate the Tax Act and its requirements, as well as its application to our business and its impact on our effective tax rate. At this stage, it is unclear how many U.S. states will incorporate these federal law changes, or portions thereof, into their tax codes. The implementation by us of new practices and processes designed to comply with, and benefit from, the Tax Act and its rules and regulations could require us to make substantial changes to our business practices, allocate additional resources, and increase our costs, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities. The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation and significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Like many other multinational corporations, we are subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Our determination of our tax liability is always subject to audit and review by applicable domestic and foreign tax authorities, and we are currently undergoing a number of investigations, audits and reviews by taxing authorities throughout the world. Any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could have a negative effect on our business, and the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the periods for which such determination is made. While we have established reserves based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventualities, these reserves may prove to be insufficient.In addition, our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated, or by the incurrence of losses, in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, as a result of gains on our foreign exchange risk management program, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items.Various levels of government, such as U.S. federal and state legislatures, and international organizations, such as the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) and the EU, are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative or regulatory action to increase tax revenue. Any such tax reform or other legislative or regulatory actions could increase our effective tax rate. We and our merchants may be subject to sales reporting and record-keeping obligations. A number of U.S. states, the U.S. federal government and foreign countries have implemented or are in the process of implementing reporting or record-keeping obligations on companies that engage in or facilitate ecommerce to improve tax compliance. Additionally, a number of jurisdictions are reviewing whether payment service providers and other intermediaries could be deemed to be the legal agent of merchants for certain tax purposes. We have modified our systems to meet known requirements and expect further modifications will be required to comply with future requirements, which may negatively impact our customer experience and increase operational costs. Any failure by us to comply with these and similar reporting and record-keeping obligations could result in substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions, adversely impact our ability to do business in certain jurisdictions, and harm our business. 27 Table of Contents Acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic investments, and other strategic transactions could result in operating difficulties and could harm our business. Acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic investments, and other strategic transactions are important elements of our overall corporate strategy. We expect to continue to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions as part of our overall business strategy, including business combinations, acquisitions, and dispositions of certain businesses, technologies, services, products, and other assets, as well as joint ventures, strategic investments, and commercial and strategic partnerships. These transactions may involve significant challenges and risks, including:•the potential loss of key customers, vendors and other key business partners of the companies we acquire, or dispose of, following and continuing after announcement of our transaction plans;•difficulty making strategic hires of new employees, declining employee morale and retention issues affecting employees (particularly the potential loss of key personnel) of companies that we acquire or dispose of, which may result from changes in compensation, management, reporting relationships, future prospects, or the direction of the acquired or disposed business;•diversion of management time and focus;•the need to and difficulty of integrating the operations, systems (including accounting, compliance, management, information, human resource and other administrative systems), technologies, products and personnel of each acquired company, which is an inherently risky and potentially lengthy and costly process;•the need to and difficulty of implementing and/or enhancing controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at acquired companies which, prior to the acquisition, may have lacked such controls, procedures and policies or whose controls, procedures and policies did not meet applicable legal and regulatory standards;•the inefficiencies and lack of control that may result if integration of acquired companies is delayed or not implemented, and unforeseen difficulties and costs that may arise as a result;•potential exposure to new or increased regulatory oversight and regulatory obligations associated with new products and services or entry into new markets;•risks associated with our expansion into new international markets;•risks associated with the complexity of entering into and effectively managing joint ventures, strategic investments, and other strategic partnerships;•risks associated with undetected cyberattacks or security breaches at companies that we acquire or with which we may combine or partner;•lawsuits or regulatory actions resulting from the transaction;•liability for activities or conduct of the acquired company before the acquisition, including legal and regulatory claims or disputes, violations of laws and regulations, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities;•the acquisition of new customer and employee personal information, which in and of itself may require regulatory approval and or additional controls, policies and procedures and subject us to additional exposure and additional complexity and costs of compliance; and•our dependence on the accounting, financial reporting, operating metrics and similar systems, controls and processes of acquired businesses and the risk that errors or irregularities in those systems, controls and processes will lead to errors in our financial statements or make it more difficult to manage the acquired business.At any given time, we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more of these or other types of transactions, any of which could, individually or in the aggregate, be material to our financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying, negotiating, and consummating favorable transaction opportunities. It may take us longer than expected to fully realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions, and those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Any acquisitions or dispositions may also require us to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt (and increased interest expense), recognize liabilities, and record amortization expenses related to intangible assets or write-offs of goodwill or intangibles, which could dilute the economic and voting rights of our stockholders and adversely affect our results of operations and the interests of holders of our indebtedness, as applicable.Joint ventures and minority investment inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, thereby potentially increasing the financial, legal, operational and/or compliance risks associated with the joint venture or minority investment. In addition, we may be dependent on joint venture partners, controlling shareholders, management or other persons or entities who control them and who may have business interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours. Business decisions or other actions or omissions of the joint venture partners, controlling shareholders, management or other persons or entities who control them and who may adversely affect the value of our investment, result in litigation or regulatory action against us and otherwise damage our reputation and brand. 28 Table of Contents There are risks associated with our indebtedness. We have incurred indebtedness, and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations, generate sufficient cash flows to service such debt and the other factors discussed in this “Risk Factors” section. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully. In addition, changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity securities and increase the interest amounts we pay on outstanding or future debt. These risks could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk. We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, including the following:•networks, banks, payment processors, and payment gateways that link us to the payment card and bank clearing networks to process transactions;•unaffiliated third-party lenders to originate loans in the U.S. for our PayPal Credit consumer product. PayPal Working Capital and other business loan products;•third parties that provide loan servicing and customer statements processing;•third parties that provide certain outsourced customer support and product development functions, which are critical to our operations; and•third parties that provide facilities, infrastructure, components and services, including data center facilities and cloud computing.Because we rely on third parties to provide services to us and our customers and to facilitate certain of our business activities, we face increased operational risk. These third parties may be subject to financial, legal, regulatory, labor or other issues, such as service terminations, disruptions or interruptions, that prevent them from providing services to us or our customers. Moreover, these third parties are themselves subject to the risks discussed earlier in the \"Risk Factors\" section under the caption \"Our business is subject to cyberattacks and security and privacy breaches.\" In addition, these third parties may breach their agreements with us, disagree with our interpretation of contract terms or applicable laws and regulations, refuse to continue or renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms or at all, fail or refuse to process transactions adequately, take actions that degrade the functionality of our services, impose additional costs or requirements on us, or give preferential treatment to competitive services. There can be no assurance that third parties who provide services directly to us or our customers will continue to do so on acceptable terms, or at all. If any third parties were to stop providing services to us or our customers on acceptable terms, we may be unable to procure alternatives from other third parties in a timely and efficient manner, and on acceptable terms or at all. If third parties we rely on do not adequately or appropriately provide their services or perform their responsibilities, we may be subject to business disruptions, losses or costs to remediate any of the deficiencies, customer dissatisfaction, reputational damage, legal or regulatory proceedings, or other adverse consequences which could harm our business. Our developer platforms, which are open to merchants and third-party developers, subject us to additional risks. We provide third-party developers with access to application programming interfaces, software development kits and other tools designed to allow them to produce applications for use, with a particular focus on mobile applications. There can be no assurance that merchants or third-party developers will develop and maintain applications and services on our open platforms on a timely basis or at all, and a number of factors could cause such third-party developers to curtail or stop development for our platforms. In addition, our business is subject to many regulatory restrictions. It is possible that merchants and third-party developers who utilize our development platforms or tools could violate these regulatory restrictions and we may be held responsible for such violations, which could harm our business. Our retail point of sale solutions expose us to additional risks. We have announced several retail point of sale solutions, which enable merchants to accept payments using a payments card reader attached to, or otherwise communicating with, a mobile device or to scan payment cards and codes using the mobile device’s embedded camera, and which enable consumers to use their mobile devices to pay at the point of sale. We have entered into strategic partnerships with major payment card networks to further expand our relationship in a way that will make it easier for merchants to accept and consumers to choose to pay for transactions utilizing these companies' credit and debit cards. Those agreements provide us with access to each of these partner's tokenization services in the U.S. for in-store point-of-sale PayPal transactions, which we expect will increase the number of point of sale transactions that we process. As we continue to expand our product and service offerings at the retail point of sale, we will face additional risks, including:•increased expectations from offline retailers regarding the reliability and availability of our systems and services and correspondingly lower amounts of downtime, which we may not be able to meet;•significant competition at the retail point of sale, particularly from established payment card providers , many of which have substantially greater resources than we do;•increased targeting by fraudsters; given that our fraud models are less developed in this area, we may experience increases in fraud and associated transaction losses as we adjust to fraudulent activity at the point of sale;•exposure to product liability claims to the extent that hardware devices that we produce for use at the retail point of sale malfunction or are not in compliance with laws, which could result in substantial liability and require product recalls or other actions;•exposure to additional laws, rules and regulations;•increased reliance on third parties involved with processing in-store payments, including independent software providers, electronic point of sale providers, hardware providers (such as cash register and pin-pad providers), payment processors and banks that enable in-store transactions; and•lower operating income than our other payment solutions.Unless we are able to successfully manage these risks, including driving adoption of, and significant volume through, our retail point of sale solutions over time, our business may be harmed. 29 Table of Contents Our success largely depends on key personnel. Because competition for our key employees is intense, we may not be able to attract, retain, and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our business. The loss of key personnel could harm our business. Our future performance depends substantially on the continued services of key personnel, including our executive team and other highly skilled employees, and our ability to attract, retain, and motivate such personnel. Competition for key personnel is intense, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area, where our corporate headquarters are located and where the cost of living is high, and we may be unable to successfully attract, integrate, or retain sufficiently qualified key personnel. In making employment decisions, particularly in the technology and payments industries, job candidates often consider the value of the equity awards they would receive in connection with their employment, and fluctuations in our stock price, or a perception that the market price of our stock may not increase or may increase more slowly than stock prices at other technology or payments companies, may make it more difficult to attract, retain, and motivate employees. We may be limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws or policies. In addition, we do not have long-term employment agreements with any of our key personnel and do not maintain any “key person” life insurance policies. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel, or our inability to attract highly qualified key personnel, could harm our business. We are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our products and services. Companies providing online services may be subject to claims relating to information disseminated through them, including claims alleging defamation, libel, harassment, hate speech, breach of contract, invasion of privacy, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, among other things. The laws relating to the liability of companies providing online services for information disseminated through their services are subject to frequent challenges. We are also subject to potential liability to third parties for the customer-provided content on our products and services, particularly in jurisdictions outside the U.S. where the applicable laws are unsettled. If we become liable for information provided by our customers and carried on our products and services, we could be directly harmed and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability, including expending substantial resources or discontinuing certain product or service offerings, which could harm our business. Risks Related to the Separation from eBay If the distribution, together with certain related transactions, does not qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), eBay, PayPal and eBay stockholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities and, in certain circumstances, we could be required to indemnify eBay for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement. On July 17, 2015, we became an independent publicly traded company through the pro rata distribution by eBay Inc. of 100% of our outstanding common stock to eBay’s stockholders (which we sometimes refer to as the “separation” or the “distribution”). eBay received an opinion from its outside legal counsel regarding the qualification of the distribution, together with certain related transactions, as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code. The opinion was based on and relied on, among other things, certain facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements and undertakings of eBay and of us, including those relating to the past and future conduct of eBay and of us. If any of these representations, statements or undertakings were, or became, inaccurate or incomplete, or if eBay or we breach any of our respective covenants in the separation documents, the opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized.Notwithstanding the opinion of counsel, the IRS could determine that the distribution, together with certain related transactions, should be treated as a taxable transaction if the IRS determines that any of these representations, assumptions, or undertakings upon which such opinion was based are incorrect or have been violated or if the IRS disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel. An opinion of counsel is not binding on the IRS or any court and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge the conclusions reached in the opinion. The IRS did not provide any opinion in advance of the separation that our proposed transaction is tax-free.If the distribution, together with certain related transactions, failed to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code, in general, eBay would recognize taxable gain as if it had sold the PayPal common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value, eBay stockholders who received PayPal common stock in the distribution may be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares and we could incur significant liabilities. 30 Table of Contents There are risks associated with certain agreements that we entered into with eBay at the separation. In connection with the separation, we entered into a separation and distribution agreement with eBay as well as various other agreements, including an operating agreement, a tax matters agreement, an employee matters agreement, an intellectual property matters agreement, a data sharing addendum, and a product development agreement. The separation agreement, the tax matters agreement, the employee matters agreement, and the intellectual property matters agreement determine the allocation of assets and liabilities (including by means of licensing) between the companies following the separation for those respective areas and include associated indemnification obligations. The operating agreement, the data sharing addendum and the product development agreement establish certain commercial relationships between eBay and us related to payment processing, credit and data sharing. If we or eBay is unable to satisfy its performance, payment or indemnification obligations under these agreements, we could incur operational difficulties or losses or be required to make substantial indemnification or other payments to eBay. Our relationship with eBay is governed in part by an operating agreement entered into at separation with a term of five years. This operating agreement defines a number of important elements of our commercial relationship with eBay, as well as certain obligations and limitations that limit PayPal’s provision of services to certain competitive platform operators of eBay (as specified in the operating agreement). eBay remains a significant source of our revenues and operating income. If our operating agreement with eBay expires or is terminated prior to its expiration, or if there is a significant change in our relationship with eBay, including if eBay becomes a merchant of record, eliminates or modifies any of its risk management or customer protection programs, directs transactions to a different provider of payment services or offers eBay customers alternative payment options, it could lead to customer dissatisfaction, reputational damage, and other adverse consequences, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed. Risks Related to Our Common Stock The price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly. The price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including, but not limited to:•actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;•changes in financial estimates by us or securities analysts and recommendations by securities analysts;•changes in our capital structure;•speculation, coverage or sentiment in the media or the investment community;•the operating and stock price performance of comparable companies;•changes to the regulatory and legal environment under which we operate; and•market conditions or trends in the payments industry, the industries of merchants and the domestic and worldwide economy as a whole. 31 Table of Contents Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the state courts of the State of Delaware, or, if no state court located in the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the District of Delaware, as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could discourage lawsuits against us and our directors and officers. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that unless the corporation otherwise determines, the state courts of the State of Delaware, or, if no state court located in the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the District of Delaware, will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors or officers to us or our stockholders, any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“DGCL”) or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes with us or our directors or officers, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors and officers. Alternatively, if a court outside of Delaware were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above, we could incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may prevent or delay an acquisition of our company, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock. Certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of deterring coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and by encouraging prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others:•rules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings;•the fact that directors may not be elected, removed or replaced at stockholder-requested special meetings unless a person, entity or group owns at least a majority of our outstanding common stock;•the right of our board to issue preferred stock and to determine the voting, dividend and other rights of preferred stock without stockholder approval;•the ability of our directors, and not stockholders, to fill vacancies on our board of directors in most circumstances and to determine the size of our board of directors;•the prohibition on stockholders acting by written consent; and•the absence of cumulative rights in the election of directors.We have also elected not to be governed by Section 203 of the DGCL, which provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that acquire, or are affiliated with a person that acquires, more than 15% of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the date on which that person or its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15% of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, however, contains a provision that generally mirrors Section 203 of the DGCL, except that it provides for a 20% threshold instead of the 15% provided for by the DGCL. These provisions could delay or prevent a change of control that our stockholders may favor.These provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers. However, these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and may delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in the best interests of us and our stockholders. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. The following discussion is divided into three sections. The first section, which begins immediately following this paragraph, discusses some of the risks that may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The second section, captioned “Risks Related to the Separation and Our Operation as an Independent Publicly Traded Company,” discusses some of the risks relating to our separation into an independent publicly traded company. The third section, captioned “Risks Related to Our Common Stock,” discusses some of the risks relating to an investment in our Common Stock. You should carefully review all of these sections for important information regarding risks and uncertainties that affect us, in addition to the other information appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition Substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry may harm our business. The global payments industry is highly competitive, and we compete against a wide range of businesses, some of which are larger than we are, have a dominant and secure position, or offer other products and services to consumers and merchants that we do not offer. The global payments industry is rapidly changing, highly innovative and increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny. Many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Competition may also intensify as businesses against which we compete or merchants enter into business combinations and alliances, and established companies in other segments expand to become competitive with our business.We compete against a wide range of businesses with varying roles in all forms of payments, including:•paper-based transactions (principally cash and checks);•providers of traditional payment methods, particularly credit and debit cards and Automated Clearing House transactions (in particular, well-established banks);•payment networks which facilitate payments for credit card users;•providers of “digital wallets” which offer customers the ability to pay online and/or in-store through a variety of payment methods, including with mobile applications, through contactless payments, and with a variety of payment cards;•providers of mobile payments solutions that use tokenized card data approaches and contactless payments (e.g., near field communication (\"NFC\") or host card emulation functionality) to eliminate the need to swipe or insert a card or enter a personal identification number or password;•payment-card processors that offer their services to merchants, including for “card on file” payments where the merchant invites the consumer to select a payment method for their first transaction and to use the same payment method for subsequent transactions;•providers of “person-to-person” payments that facilitate individuals sending money with an email address or mobile phone number;•merchants and merchant associations providing proprietary payment networks to facilitate payments within their own retail network;•money remitters;•providers of card readers for mobile devices and of other point-of-sale and multi-channel technologies; and•providers of virtual currencies and distributed ledger technologies.We often partner with many of these businesses and we consider the ability to continue establishing these partnerships as important to our business. Competition for relationships with these partners is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to establish, grow or maintain these partner relationships.We also face competition and potential competition from:•service providers that provide online merchants the ability to offer their customers the option of paying for purchases from their bank account or paying on credit;•issuers of stored value targeted at online payments;•other global online and mobile payment-services providers;•other providers of online and mobile account-based payments;•services targeting users of social networks and online gaming, including those offering social commerce and peer-to-peer payments;•mobile payment services between bank accounts;•payment services enabling banking customers to send and receive payments through their bank account, including through immediate or real-time payments systems;•ecommerce services that provide special offers linked to a specific payment provider; •services that help merchants accept and manage virtual currencies; and•electronic funds transfer services as a method of payment for both online and offline transactions.Some of these competitors have larger customer bases, volume, scale, resources, and market share than we do, which may provide significant competitive advantages. Some of our competitors may also be subject to less burdensome licensing, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, and other regulatory requirements. They may devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of products and services, and they may offer lower prices or more effectively introduce their own innovative programs, products and services that adversely impact our growth.We compete primarily on the basis of the following:•ability to attract, retain and engage both merchants and consumers;•ability to demonstrate that merchants will achieve incremental sales by offering PayPal services;•consumer confidence in safety and security of transactions on our Payments Platform, including the ability for consumers to use PayPal products and services without sharing their financial information with the merchant or the party they are paying;•simplicity of our fee structure;•ability to develop services across multiple commerce channels, including mobile payments and payments at the retail point of sale;•trust in our dispute resolution and buyer and seller protection programs;•customer service;•brand recognition;•website, mobile platform and application onboarding, ease-of-use, speed, availability, and dependability;•the technology- and payment-agnostic nature of our Payments Platform;•system reliability and data security;•ease and quality of integration into third-party mobile applications and operating systems; and•quality of developer tools, such as our application programming interfaces and software development kits.If we are not able to differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors, drive value for our customers, or effectively align our resources with our goals and objectives, we may not be able to compete effectively against our competitors. Our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threats could materially and adversely harm our business. 11 Table of Contents 12 Table of Contents Substantially all of our net revenues each quarter come primarily from transactions involving payments during that quarter, which may result in significant fluctuations in our operating results that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, as well as the trading price of our common stock. Substantially all of our net revenues each quarter come primarily from transactions involving payments during that quarter. As a result, our operating and financial results have varied on a quarterly basis during our operating history, and may continue to fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including as a result of the risks set forth in this “Risk Factors” section. It is difficult for us to forecast the level or source of our revenues or earnings accurately. In view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful, and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance. Due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting revenues, it is also difficult to forecast expenses as a percentage of net revenues. Quarterly and annual expenses as a percentage of net revenues reflected in our financial statements may be significantly different from historical or projected rates. Our operating results in one or more future quarters may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. The trading price of our common stock may decline significantly as a result of the factors described in this paragraph. Global and regional economic conditions could harm our business. Our operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions. Uncertainty about global and regional economic events and conditions may result in consumers and businesses postponing or lowering spending in response to tighter credit, higher unemployment, financial market volatility, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, government austerity programs, negative financial news, declines in income or asset values, and other factors. These and other global and regional economic events and conditions could have a material adverse impact on the demand for our products and services, including a reduction in the volume and size of transactions on our Payments Platform. In addition, any financial turmoil affecting the banking system or financial markets could cause additional consolidation of the financial services industry, significant financial service institution failures, new or incremental tightening in the credit markets, low liquidity, and extreme volatility or distress in the fixed income, credit, currency and equity markets, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. If we cannot keep pace with rapid technological developments to provide new and innovative products and services, the use of our products and services and, consequently, our revenues could decline. Rapid, significant, and disruptive technological changes impact the industries in which we operate, including developments in payment card tokenization, mobile, social commerce (i.e., ecommerce through social networks), authentication, virtual currencies (including distributed ledger technologies), and NFC and other proximity payment devices, such as contactless payments. We cannot predict the effects of technological changes on our business. In addition to our own initiatives and innovations, we rely in part on third parties, including some of our competitors, for the development of and access to new technologies. We expect that new services and technologies applicable to the industries in which we operate will continue to emerge and may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies we currently use in our products and services. Developing and incorporating new technologies into our products and services may require substantial expenditures, take considerable time, and ultimately may not be successful. In addition, our ability to adopt new products and services and to develop new technologies may be inhibited by industry-wide standards, payments networks, changes to laws and regulations, resistance to change from consumers or merchants, third-party intellectual property rights, or other factors. Our success will depend on our ability to develop and incorporate new technologies and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards; if we are unable to do so in a timely or cost-effective manner, our business could be harmed. Changes in how consumers fund their PayPal transactions could harm our business. We pay transaction fees when consumers fund payment transactions using credit cards, lower fees when consumers fund payments with debit cards, and nominal fees when consumers fund payment transactions by electronic transfer of funds from bank accounts, or from an existing PayPal account balance or through our PayPal Credit products. Our financial success is sensitive to changes in the rate at which our consumers fund payments using credit and debit cards (collectively, “payment cards”), which can significantly increase our costs. Although we provide consumers with the opportunity to use their existing PayPal account balance to fund payment transactions, some of our consumers may prefer to use payment cards, especially if these payment cards offer features and benefits that are not provided as part of their PayPal accounts. An increase in the portion of our payment volume funded using payment cards or in fees associated with our funding mix, or other events or developments that make it more difficult or costly for us to fund transactions with lower-cost funding options, could materially and adversely affect our financial performance and significantly harm our business. We have entered into strategic partnerships with major payment card networks and/or issuing banks to promote greater consumer choice and make it easier for merchants to accept and consumers to pay with these partners’ credit and/or debt cards and to allow us to gain access to these partners’ tokenization services for in-store point of sale PayPal transactions. These arrangements may have an uncertain impact on our business. While we anticipate that these and similar strategic partnerships we may enter into in the future will result in an increase in the number of transactions and transaction volume that we process, we also anticipate that a greater percentage of customer transactions will be executed using a payment card, which would likely increase the transaction costs associated with our funding mix, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. 13 Table of Contents Our business is subject to cyberattacks and security and privacy breaches. Our business involves the collection, storage, processing and transmission of customers’ personal data, including financial information and information about how they interact with our Payments Platform. In addition, a significant number of our customers authorize us to bill their payment card or bank accounts directly for all transaction and other fees charged by us. We have built our reputation on the premise that our Payments Platform offers customers a more secure way to make payments. An increasing number of organizations, including large merchants and businesses, other large technology companies, financial institutions, and government institutions, have disclosed breaches of their information security systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks, including on their websites and infrastructure.The techniques used to obtain unauthorized, improper or illegal access to our systems, our data or customers' data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems are constantly evolving, may be difficult to detect quickly, and often are not recognized until launched against a target. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means, including hacking into our systems or facilities or those of our customers, partners or vendors, or attempting to fraudulently induce (often through spear phishing attacks) our employees, customers, partners, vendors or other users of our systems into disclosing user names, passwords, payment card information, or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems. Certain efforts may be state-sponsored and supported by significant financial and technological resources, making them even more sophisticated and difficult to detect. We believe that PayPal is a particularly attractive target for such breaches and attacks due to our name and brand recognition and the widespread adoption and use of our products and services. Although we have developed systems and processes designed to protect our data and customer data and to prevent data loss and other security breaches, and expect to continue to expend significant resources to bolster these protections, these security measures cannot provide absolute security. Our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyberattacks or security breaches, and third parties may be able to access our customers’ personal or proprietary information and payment card data that are stored on or accessible through those systems. Our security measures may also be breached due to human error, malfeasance, system errors or vulnerabilities, or other irregularities. Actual or perceived breaches of our security could interrupt our operations, result in our systems or services being unavailable, result in improper disclosure of data, materially harm our reputation and brands, result in significant regulatory scrutiny and legal and financial exposure, cause us to incur significant remediation costs, lead to loss of customer confidence in, or decreased use of, our products and services, divert the attention of management from the operation of our business, result in significant compensation or contractual penalties from us to our customers and their business partners as a result of losses to them or claims by them, and adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, any cyberattacks or data security breaches affecting companies that we acquire or our customers, partners or vendors (including data center and cloud computing providers) could have similar negative effects. See Note 3—\"Business Combinations,\" Note 4—\"Goodwill and Intangible Assets\" and Note 13—\"Commitments and Contingencies\" to our consolidated financial statements for disclosure relating to the suspension of operations of TIO Networks (\"TIO\") (which we acquired in July 2017) as part of an ongoing investigation of security vulnerability of the TIO platform. Actual or perceived vulnerabilities or data breaches have led and may lead to claims against us.In addition, under payment card rules and our contracts with our card processors, if there is a breach of payment card information that we store, or that is stored by our direct payment card processing customers, we could be liable to the payment card issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses. We also expect to expend significant additional resources to protect against security or privacy breaches, and may be required to redress problems caused by breaches. Financial services regulators in various jurisdictions, including the U.S. and the EU, have implemented authentication requirements for banks and payment processors intended to reduce online fraud, which could impose significant costs, require us to change our business practices, make it more difficult for new customers to join PayPal, and reduce the ease of use of our products, which could harm our business. Additionally, while we maintain insurance policies, they may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches. 14 Table of Contents Systems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our websites, applications, products or services could harm our business. Our systems and those of our services providers and partners may experience service interruptions or degradation because of hardware and software defects or malfunctions, computer denial-of-service and other cyberattacks, human error, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, natural disasters, power losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist attacks, computer viruses or other malware, or other events. Our systems also may be subject to break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. In addition, as a provider of payments solutions, we are subject to heightened scrutiny by regulators that may require specific business continuity, resiliency and disaster recovery plans, and more rigorous testing of such plans, which may be costly and time-consuming and may divert our resources from other business priorities.We have experienced and expect to continue to experience system failures, denial of service attacks, and other events or conditions from time to time that interrupt the availability, or reduce or adversely affect the speed or functionality of our products and services. These events have resulted and likely will result in loss of revenue. A prolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in the availability, speed or functionality of our products and services could materially harm our business. Frequent or persistent interruptions in our services could cause current or potential customers to believe that our systems are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid or reduce the use of our products and services, and could permanently harm our reputation and brands. Moreover, if any system failure or similar event results in damages to our customers or their business partners, these customers or partners could seek significant compensation or contractual penalties from us for their losses, and those claims, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and costly for us to address, and could have other consequences described in this “Risk Factors” section under the caption “Our business is subject to cyberattacks and security and privacy breaches.”Our Payments Platform has experienced and may in the future experience intermittent unavailability. The full-time availability and expeditious delivery of our products and services is critical to our goal of gaining widespread acceptance among consumers and merchants for digital payments. We have undertaken certain system upgrades and re-platforming efforts designed to improve our reliability and speed. These efforts are costly and time-consuming, involve significant technical risk and may divert our resources from new features and products, and there can be no guarantee that these efforts will succeed. Because we are a regulated financial institution in certain jurisdictions, frequent or persistent site interruptions could lead to regulatory scrutiny, significant fines and penalties, and mandatory and costly changes to our business practices, and ultimately could cause us to lose existing licenses that we need to operate or prevent or delay us from obtaining additional licenses that may be required for our business.We also rely on facilities, components and services supplied by third parties, including data center facilities and cloud storage services. If these third parties cease to provide the facilities or services, experience operational interference or disruptions, breach their agreements with us, or fail to perform their obligations and meet our expectations, our operations could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected, which could result in customer dissatisfaction and damage to our reputation and brands, and materially and adversely affect our business. We do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for all losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of systems failures and similar events.In addition, we are continually improving and upgrading our information systems and technologies. Implementation of new systems and technologies is complex, expensive and time-consuming. If we fail to timely and successfully implement new information systems and technologies, or improvements or upgrades to existing information systems and technologies, or if such systems and technologies do not operate as intended, this could have an adverse impact on our business, internal controls (including internal controls over financial reporting), results of operations and financial condition. Changes to payment card networks or bank fees, rules, or practices could harm our business. We rely on banks or other payment processors to process transactions and pay fees for the services. From time to time, payment card networks have increased, and may increase in the future, the interchange fees and assessments that they charge for each transaction that accesses their networks. Payment card networks have or may impose special fees or assessments for transactions that are executed through a “digital wallet” such as PayPal’s, which could particularly impact us and significantly increase our costs. Our payment card processors may have the right to pass any increases in interchange fees and assessments on to us as well as increase their own fees for processing. Any changes in interchange fees and assessments could increase our operating costs and reduce our operating income. We have entered into strategic partnerships with Visa and Mastercard to further expand our relationships in a way that will make it easier for merchants to accept and consumers to choose to pay with Visa and Mastercard credit and debit cards. During the terms of these agreements, Visa and Mastercard have each agreed to not enact or impose any fees or rules that solely target PayPal. Upon termination of the agreements, PayPal could become subject to special digital wallet fees or other special assessments.In addition, in some jurisdictions, governmental regulations have required payment card networks to reduce interchange fees. Any material change in credit or debit card interchange rates in the U.S. or other markets, including as a result of changes in interchange fee limitations, could adversely affect our competitive position against traditional credit and debit card service providers and our business.We are required by our processors to comply with payment card network operating rules, including special operating rules for payment service providers to merchants. We have agreed to reimburse our processors for any fines they are assessed by payment card networks as a result of any rule violations by us or our merchants. The payment card networks set and interpret the card operating rules. From time to time, the networks have alleged that various aspects of our business model violate these operating rules. If such allegations are not resolved favorably, they may result in significant fines and penalties or require changes in our business practices that may be costly. The payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or re-interpret existing rules that we or our processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow, or costly to implement. As a result, we could lose our ability to give consumers the option of using payment cards to fund their payments or the choice of currency in which they would like their payment card to be charged. If we are unable to accept payment cards or are limited in our ability to do so, our business would be adversely affected.We and our payment card processors have implemented specific business processes for merchants to comply with payment card network operating rules for providing services to merchants. Any failure to comply with these rules could result in fines. We are also subject to fines from payment card networks if we fail to detect that merchants are engaging in activities that are illegal or that are considered “high risk,” including the sale of certain types of digital content. For “high risk” merchants, we must either prevent such merchants from using PayPal services or register such merchants with the payment card networks and conduct additional monitoring with respect to such merchants. Although the amount of these fines has not been material to date, additional fines in the future could become significant and could result in a termination of our ability to accept payment cards or require changes in our process for registering new customers, which would adversely affect our business. Payment card network rules may also increase the cost of, impose restrictions on, or otherwise negatively impact the development of, our retail point-of-sale solutions, which may negatively impact their deployment and adoption. 15 Table of Contents Failure to deal effectively with fraud, fictitious transactions, bad transactions, and negative customer experiences would increase our loss rate and harm our business, and could severely diminish merchant and consumer confidence in and use of our services. In the event that merchants do not fulfill their obligations to consumers or a merchant's goods or services do not match the merchant’s description, we may incur substantial losses as a result of claims from consumers. We seek to recover such losses from the merchant, but may not be able to recover in full if the merchant is unwilling or unable to pay. In addition, in the event of the bankruptcy or other business interruption of a merchant that sells goods or services in advance of the date of their delivery or use (e.g., airline, cruise or concert tickets, custom-made goods and subscriptions), we could be liable to the buyers of such goods or services, either through our buyer protection program or through chargebacks on payment cards used by customers to fund their payment. While we have established reserves based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventualities, these reserves may be insufficient.We also incur substantial losses from claims that the consumer did not authorize the purchase, from customer fraud, from erroneous transactions, and as a result of customers who have closed bank accounts or have insufficient funds in their bank accounts to satisfy payments. In addition, if losses incurred by us related to payment card transactions become excessive, they could potentially result in our losing the right to accept payment cards for payment, which would harm our business. We have taken measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud, but these measures need to be continually improved and may not be effective against fraud, particularly new and continually evolving forms of fraud or in connection with new product offerings. If these measures do not succeed, our business could be harmed. We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We have significant operations internationally that are denominated in foreign currencies, including the British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar, subjecting us to foreign currency risk. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar versus the British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar, and Canadian Dollar impacts the translation of our net revenues generated in these foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar. In connection with providing our services in multiple currencies, we may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the times that we set them. Given that we also hold some corporate and customer funds in non-U.S. currencies, our financial results are affected by the remeasurement of these non-U.S. currencies into U.S. dollars. We also have foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. While we regularly enter into transactions to hedge foreign currency risk for portions of our foreign currency translation and balance sheet exposure, it is impossible to predict or eliminate the effects of this exposure. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could materially and adversely impact our financial results. 16 Table of Contents Any factors that reduce cross-border trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business. Cross-border trade (i.e., transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries) is an important source of our revenue and profits. Cross-border transactions generally provide higher revenues and operating income than similar transactions that take place within a single country or market. Cross-border trade also represents our primary (and in some cases, our only) presence in certain important markets.Cross-border trade is subject to, and may be negatively impacted by, foreign exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, the interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions (e.g., the jurisdiction of the merchant and of the consumer) are often extremely complicated in the context of cross-border trade. Changes to or the interpretation and/or application of laws and regulations applicable to cross-border trade could impose additional requirements and restrictions, impose conflicting obligations, and increase the costs associated with cross-border trade. Any factors that increase the costs of cross-border trade for us or our customers or that restrict, delay, or make cross-border trade more difficult or impractical would lower our revenues and profits and could harm our business. The United Kingdom’s departure from the EU could adversely affect us. The United Kingdom (“U.K.”) held a referendum in June 2016 in which a majority of voters approved an exit from the EU (“Brexit”). In March 2017, the U.K. invoked Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, which triggered a two-year period, with extension subject to unanimous consent by the other EU member states, during which the U.K. government will negotiate its withdrawal agreement with the EU. Brexit could adversely affect U.K., regional (including European), and worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the British Pound and Euro, which in turn could adversely affect our customers and companies with which we do business, particularly in the U.K. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and see national laws and regulations in the U.K. diverge from EU laws and regulations, as the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. In particular, depending on the terms of Brexit, we may face new regulatory costs and challenges, including the following:•we could lose our ability for our EU operations to offer services on a cross-border basis into the U.K. market utilizing regulatory permissions of PayPal (Europe) S.à r.l. et Cie, SCA (“PayPal (Europe)”), our wholly-owned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a credit institution in Luxembourg, and our corresponding ability to work with the Luxembourg regulators as the lead authority for various aspects of our U.K. operations;•we could be required to obtain additional regulatory permissions to operate in the U.K. market, adding costs and potential inconsistency to our business (and, depending on the capacity of the U.K. authorities, the criteria for obtaining permission, and any possible transitional arrangements, there is a risk that our business in the U.K. could be materially affected or disrupted); •we could be required to comply with regulatory requirements in the U.K. that are in addition to, or inconsistent with, the regulatory requirements of the EU; and•our ability to attract and retain the necessary human resources in appropriate locations to support the U.K. business and the EU business of PayPal could be adversely impacted.Any of the effects of Brexit described above and others that we cannot anticipate could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight, as well as extensive, complex, overlapping and frequently changing rules, regulations and legal interpretations. Our business is subject to laws, rules, regulations, policies, and legal interpretations in the markets in which we operate, including, but not limited to, those governing banking, credit, deposit taking, cross-border and domestic money transmission, foreign exchange, privacy, data protection, cybersecurity, banking secrecy, payment services (including payment processing and settlement services), consumer protection, economic and trade sanctions, anti-money laundering, and counter-terrorist financing. The legal and regulatory requirements applicable to us are extensive, complex, frequently changing, and increasing in number, and may impose overlapping and/or conflicting requirements or obligations.Financial and political events have increased the level of regulatory scrutiny on the payments industry, and regulatory agencies may view matters or interpret laws and regulations differently than they have in the past and in a manner adverse to our business. Our success and increased visibility may result in increased regulatory oversight and tighter enforcement of rules and regulations that may apply to our business.As we expand and localize our international activities, we are increasingly becoming obligated to comply with the laws of the countries or markets in which we operate. In addition, because our services are accessible worldwide and we facilitate sales of goods and provide services to customers worldwide, one or more jurisdictions may claim that we or our customers are required to comply with their laws. Laws regulating the Internet, mobile and related technologies outside of the U.S. often impose different, more specific, or even conflicting obligations on us, as well as broader liability. For example, certain transactions that may be permissible in a local jurisdiction may be prohibited by regulations of U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) or U.S. anti-money laundering or counter-terrorist financing regulations.Any failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or new laws, regulations or orders of any governmental authority (including changes to or expansion of the interpretation of those laws, regulations or orders), including those discussed in this risk factor, may subject us to significant fines, penalties, criminal and civil lawsuits, forfeiture of significant assets, and enforcement actions in one or more jurisdictions, result in additional compliance and licensure requirements, increase regulatory scrutiny of our business, restrict our operations, and force us to change our business practices, make product or operational changes or delay planned product launches or improvements. Any of the foregoing could, individually or in the aggregate, damage our brands and business, and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The complexity of U.S. federal and state regulatory and enforcement regimes, coupled with the global scope of our operations and the evolving global regulatory environment, could result in a single event giving rise to a large number of overlapping investigations and legal and regulatory proceedings by multiple government authorities in different jurisdictions. We have implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws, and regulations, but there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations. 17 Table of Contents Payments Regulation In the U.S., PayPal, Inc. has obtained licenses to operate as a money transmitter (or its equivalent) in the states where it is required, as well as in the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. These licenses include not only the PayPal branded products and services in these states, but also our Braintree, Venmo, Xoom and TIO branded products and services. As a licensed money transmitter, PayPal is subject to restrictions with respect to the investment of customer funds, reporting requirements, bonding requirements and inspection by state regulatory agencies. Accordingly, if we violate these laws or regulations, we could be subject to liability and/or additional restrictions, forced to cease doing business with residents of certain states, forced to change our business practices or required to obtain additional licenses or regulatory approvals, which could impose substantial costs.While we currently allow our customers with payment cards to send payments from approximately 200 markets, we allow customers in only approximately half of those markets (including the U.S.) to also receive payments, in some cases with significant restrictions on the manner in which customers can withdraw funds. These limitations may adversely affect our ability to grow our business in these markets. We provide our services to customers in the EU through PayPal (Europe), our wholly-owned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a credit institution in Luxembourg. Accordingly, PayPal (Europe) is subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if it violates the disclosure, reporting, anti-money laundering, capitalization, fund management, corporate governance, privacy, data protection, information security, banking secrecy, taxation, sanctions, or other requirements imposed on Luxembourg banks. In addition, EU laws and regulations are typically subject to different and potentially inconsistent interpretations by the countries that are members of the EU, which can make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage. Moreover, the countries that are EU members may each have different and potentially inconsistent domestic regulations implementing European Directives, including the EU Payment Services Directive and the E-Money Directive, which could make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage. The Revised Payment Services Directive (“PSD2”) entered into force in January 2016 and is in the process of being implemented into national legislation, with certain requirements effective January 13, 2018. The implementation of the PSD2 may negatively affect our business. PSD2 seeks to enable new payment models whereby a newly formed category of regulated payment provider would be able to access bank and payment accounts (including PayPal accounts) for the purposes of accessing account information or initiating a payment on behalf of a customer. Such access could subject us to data security and other legal and financial risks and could create new competitive forces and new types of competitors in the European payments market. PSD2 seeks to regulate more online platforms that handle payments for their sellers. PayPal merchants with affected business models which are not licensed, or which do not benefit from exemptions or integrate a compliant marketplaces solution may not be able to offer PayPal products in the future. PSD2 also imposes new standards for payment security and strong customer authentication that may make it more difficult and time consuming to carry out a PayPal transaction, which may adversely impact PayPal’s customer value proposition and its European business.Finally, if the business activities of PayPal (Europe) exceed certain thresholds, or if the European Central Bank (“ECB”) determines that PayPal (Europe) is a significant supervised entity or that some activity of PayPal (Europe) is deemed subject to oversight by the ECB, PayPal (Europe) could become directly regulated by the ECB in addition to the Luxembourg regulator, the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (the \"CSSF\"), as its national supervisor, which could subject us to additional requirements and would likely increase compliance costs.In Australia, we serve our customers through PayPal Australia Pty. Ltd. (“PayPal Australia”), which is licensed by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission as a provider of a non-cash payment product and by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority as a purchased payment facility provider, which is a type of authorized depository institution. Accordingly, PayPal Australia is subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if it violates the product disclosure, reporting, anti-money laundering, capital requirements, privacy, corporate governance or other requirements imposed on Australian depository institutions.In Hong Kong, we serve our customers through PayPal Hong Kong Limited (“PayPal Hong Kong”), which is licensed by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority as an issuer of stored value facility (“SVF Licensee”). Accordingly, PayPal Hong Kong is subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if it violates the reporting, anti-money laundering, capital requirements, privacy, corporate governance, risk management, float management, and/or any other requirements imposed on SVF Licensees.In many of the other markets in which we do business, we serve our customers through PayPal Pte. Ltd., our wholly-owned subsidiary based in Singapore. PayPal Pte. Ltd. is supervised by the Monetary Authority of Singapore and designated as a holder of a stored value facility, but does not hold a remittance license. As a result, PayPal Pte. Ltd. is not able to offer outbound remittance payments (including donations to charities) from Singapore, and can only offer payments for the purchase of goods and services in Singapore. In many of the markets (other than Singapore) served by PayPal Pte. Ltd., it is unclear and uncertain whether our Singapore-based service is subject only to Singapore law or, if it is subject to the application of local laws, whether such local laws would require a payment processor like us to be licensed as a payments service, bank, financial institution or otherwise.We are also subject to regulation in other markets in which we do business, and we have been and expect to continue to be required to apply for various licenses, certifications and regulatory approvals in a number of the countries where we provide our services. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such licenses, certifications, and approvals. In addition, there are substantial costs and potential product changes involved in maintaining such licenses, certifications, and approvals, and we could be subject to fines or other enforcement action if we are found to violate disclosure, reporting, anti-money laundering, capitalization, corporate governance or other requirements of such licenses. These factors could impose substantial additional costs and involve considerable delay to the development or provision of our products or services, or could require significant and costly operational changes or prevent us from providing our products or services in a given market.In many countries, it may not be clear whether we are required to be licensed as a payment services provider, bank, financial institution or otherwise. In such markets, we may rely on local banks to process payments and conduct foreign exchange transactions in local currency. Local regulators may use their power to slow or halt payments to local merchants conducted through local banks or otherwise prohibit us from doing business in a country. Such regulatory actions or the need to obtain licenses, certifications or other regulatory approvals could impose substantial costs, involve considerable delay to the provision or development of our services, require significant and costly operational changes, impose restrictions, limitations, or additional requirements on our business, or prevent us from providing any products or services in a given market. 18 Table of Contents Consumer Protection The financial services sector is subject to significant regulation and we are subject to consumer protection laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. In the U.S., we are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations applicable to our activities, including the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (“EFTA”) and Regulation E as implemented by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). These regulations require us to provide advance disclosure of changes to our services, follow specified error resolution procedures, and reimburse consumers for losses from certain transactions not authorized by the consumer, among other requirements. Additionally, technical violations of consumer protection laws could result in the assessment of actual damages or statutory damages or penalties of up to $1,000 in individual cases or up to $500,000 per violation in any class action and treble damages in some instances; we could also be liable for plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees in such cases. We are subject to, and have paid amounts in settlement of, lawsuits containing allegations that our business violated the EFTA and Regulation E or otherwise advance claims for relief relating to our business practices (e.g., that we improperly held consumer funds or otherwise improperly limited consumer accounts).In October 2016, the CFPB issued a final rule on prepaid accounts. The rule’s definition of prepaid account includes certain accounts that are capable of being loaded with funds and whose primary function is to conduct transactions with multiple, unaffiliated merchants, at ATMs and/or for person-to-person transfers, including certain digital wallets. The rule’s requirements include: the disclosure of fees and other information to the consumer prior to the creation of a prepaid account; the extension of Regulation E liability limits and error-resolution requirements to all prepaid accounts; the application of Regulation Z credit card requirements to prepaid accounts with overdraft and credit features; and the submission of prepaid account agreements to the CFPB and their publication to the general public. In April 2017, the CFPB delayed the effective date of the final rule on prepaid accounts to April 1, 2018, and indicated that it would review, among other issues, the linking of credit cards to digital wallets that are capable of storing funds. In June 2017, the CFPB released proposed changes to its final rule, and in January 2018, the CFPB issued its final rule,with an effective date of April 1, 2019. We are evaluating the final rule and its requirements. Implementation of the rule could require us to make substantial changes to our business practices and the design of certain products, allocate additional resources, and increase our costs, which could negatively affect our business.In May 2015, we entered into a Stipulated Final Judgment and Consent Order (“Consent Order”) with the CFPB in which we settled regulatory claims arising from PayPal Credit practices between 2011 and 2015. The Consent Order included obligations on PayPal to pay $15 million in redress to consumers and a $10 million civil monetary penalty, and required PayPal to make various changes to PayPal Credit disclosures and related business practices. We continue to cooperate and engage with the CFPB and work to ensure compliance with the Consent Order, which may result in us incurring additional costs.PayPal (Europe) principally offers its services in EU countries through a “passport” notification process through the Luxembourg regulator to regulators in other EU member states pursuant to EU regulation. Regulators in these countries could notify PayPal (Europe) of local consumer protection laws that apply to its business, in addition to Luxembourg consumer protection law, and could also seek to persuade the Luxembourg regulator to order PayPal (Europe) to conduct its or the PayPal group's activities in the local country directly or through a branch office. These or similar actions by these regulators could increase the cost of, or delay, our plans to expand our business in EU countries. 19 Table of Contents Economic and Trade Sanctions We are required to comply with U.S. economic and trade sanctions administered by OFAC. We have self-reported to OFAC certain transactions that were inadvertently processed but subsequently identified as possible violations of U.S. economic and trade sanctions. In March 2015, we reached a settlement with OFAC regarding possible violations arising from our sanctions compliance practices between 2009 and 2013, prior to the implementation of our real-time transaction scanning program. Subsequently, we have self-reported additional transactions as possible violations, and we have received new subpoenas from OFAC seeking additional information about certain of these transactions. Such self-reported transactions could result in claims or actions against us, including litigation, injunctions, damage awards, fines or penalties, or require us to change our business practices in a manner that could result in a material loss, require significant management time, result in the diversion of significant operational resources or otherwise harm our business. Furthermore, compliance with economic and trade sanctions in force in one jurisdiction may conflict with the laws and regulations of other jurisdictions in which we operate and can expose us to the risk of fines, sanctions and penalties. Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing We are subject to various anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws and regulations around the world that prohibit, among other things, our involvement in transferring the proceeds of criminal activities. U.S. and other regulators globally continue to increase their scrutiny of compliance with these obligations, which may require us to further revise or expand our compliance program, including the procedures we use to verify the identity of our customers and to monitor international and domestic transactions. Many countries in which we operate also have anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws and regulations, and we have been and will continue to be required to make changes to our compliance program in various jurisdictions in response. Regulators regularly re-examine the transaction volume thresholds at which we must obtain and keep applicable records or verify identities of customers and any change in such thresholds could result in greater costs for compliance. In the EU, the implementation of the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive and the regulation on information accompanying transfer of funds (commonly known as the Revised Wire Transfer Regulation) are expected to make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage, lead to increased friction for customers, and result in a decrease in business. As of December 2017, PayPal (Europe)’s home state, Luxembourg, had not yet implemented all of the provisions of the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive and there is uncertainty as to the exact requirements with which PayPal (Europe) will be required to comply. Penalties for non-compliance with the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive could include fines of up to 10% of PayPal (Europe)’s total annual turnover. EU institutions are also proposing changes to the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive which could be even more stringent. 20 Table of Contents Privacy and Protection of User Data We are subject to a number of laws, rules, directives and regulations (which we refer to as “privacy laws”) relating to the collection, use, retention, security, processing and transfer (which we refer to as “process”) of personally identifiable information about our customers and employees (which we refer to as “personal data”) in the countries where we operate. Much of the personal data that we process, especially financial information, is regulated by multiple privacy laws and, in some cases, the privacy laws of multiple jurisdictions. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between or among us, our subsidiaries, and other parties with which we have commercial relationships.Regulatory scrutiny of privacy, data protection, and the collection, use and sharing of data is increasing around the world. There is uncertainty associated with the legal and regulatory environment relating to privacy and data protection laws, which continue to develop in ways we cannot predict, including with respect to evolving technologies such as cloud computing. Privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and impose inconsistent or conflicting requirements. Complying with varying jurisdictional requirements could increase the costs and complexity of compliance or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business, and violations of privacy and data protection-related laws may expose us to significant damage awards, fines and other penalties that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business and reputation. In addition, compliance with inconsistent privacy laws may restrict our ability to provide products and services to our customers.PayPal relies on a variety of compliance methods to transfer personal data of EU citizens to the U.S., including reliance on Binding Corporate Rules (“BCRs”) for internal transfers of certain types of personal data and Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”) as approved by the European Commission for transfers to and from third parties. PayPal must also ensure that third parties processing personal data of PayPal’s EU customers and/or employees outside of the EU have compliant transfer mechanisms. In October 2015, the European Court of Justice invalidated U.S.-EU Safe Harbor framework clauses that were previously relied upon by some PayPal vendors to lawfully transfer personal data of EU citizens to U.S. companies, and PayPal entered into SCCs with those third parties who had previously relied on the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor framework. In July 2016, the U.S. and EU authorities agreed on a replacement for Safe Harbor known as “Privacy Shield.” Both the Privacy Shield framework and SCCs are facing legal challenges in the European justice system. To the extent that the Privacy Shield or SCCs are invalidated, PayPal’s ability to process EU personal data with third parties outside of the EU could be jeopardized.In 2016, the EU adopted a comprehensive overhaul of its data protection regime from the current national legislative approach to a single European Economic Area Privacy Regulation, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which comes into effect in May 2018. The proposed EU data protection regime expands the scope of the EU data protection law to all foreign companies processing personal data of EU residents, imposes a strict data protection compliance regime with severe penalties of up to the greater of 4% of worldwide turnover and €20 million, and includes new rights such as the “portability” of personal data. Although the GDPR will apply across the EU without a need for local implementing legislation, local data protection authorities (“DPAs”) will still have the ability to interpret the GDPR through so-called opening clauses, which permit region-specific data protection legislation and have the potential to create inconsistencies on a country-by-country basis. We are evaluating the rule and its requirements. Implementation of the GDPR could require us to change our business practices and increase the costs and complexity of compliance.PayPal also faces additional potential challenges from local DPAs. Because PayPal (Europe) is headquartered in Luxembourg and subject to regulation as a bank in that jurisdiction, we have relied on the “one-stop-shop” concept under which Luxembourg has been our lead data protection regulator in the EU. However, a 2015 European Court of Justice ruling (Weltimmo) affecting companies that do business in the EU potentially could make us subject to the local data protection laws or regulatory enforcement activities of the various EU member states in which we have established legal entities and which apply privacy laws that are different than, and may conflict with, Luxembourg privacy laws.In addition, because of the large number of text messages, emails, phone calls and other communications we send or make to our customers for various business purposes, communication-related privacy laws that provide a specified monetary damage award or fine for each violation could result in particularly significant damage awards or fines. For example, under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”), in the U.S., plaintiffs may seek actual monetary loss or statutory damages of $500 per violation, whichever is greater, and courts may treble the damage award for willful or knowing violations. We have been, and may continue to be subject to lawsuits (including class-action lawsuits) containing allegations that our business violated the TCPA. These lawsuits seek damages (including statutory damages) and injunctive relief, among other remedies. Given the large number of communications we send to our customers, a determination that there have been violations of the TCPA or other communications-based statutes could expose us to significant damage awards that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business.Data protection, privacy and information security have become the subject of increasing public, media, regulatory and legislative concern. We post on our websites and applications our privacy policies and practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of user data. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies, with any applicable regulatory requirements or orders, or with privacy, data protection, information security or consumer protection-related laws and regulations in one or more jurisdictions could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, including class action privacy litigation in certain jurisdictions, subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments and negative publicity, require us to change our business practices, increase the costs and complexity of compliance, and adversely affect our business. As noted above, we are also subject to the possibility of security and privacy breaches, which themselves may result in a violation of privacy laws. 21 Table of Contents If one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their financial or performance obligations to us or fail, we may incur significant losses. We have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the U.S. and abroad. As part of our currency hedging activities, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments with various financial institutions. Certain banks and financial institutions are also lenders under our credit facilities. We regularly monitor our exposure to counterparty credit risk, and actively manage this exposure to mitigate the associated risk. Despite these efforts, we may be exposed to the risk of default by, or deteriorating operating results or financial condition or failure of, these counterparty financial institutions. The risk of counterparty default, deterioration or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets. If one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or to access or recover our assets that are deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty’s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties, we could incur significant losses, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. PayPal is not a bank or licensed lender in the U.S. and relies upon third parties to make loans and provide other products critical to our business. As PayPal is neither a chartered financial institution nor licensed to make loans in any state in the U.S., we rely on a third-party chartered financial institution to issue the PayPal Credit consumer product in the U.S., and different chartered financial institutions to issue the PayPal Working Capital product and other business loan products in the U.S. These chartered financial institutions are state chartered industrial banks. Any termination or interruption in a partner bank’s ability to lend could result in us being unable or unwilling to offer our consumer and business loan products, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to issue our loan products in the U.S. and our business. In the event of a partner bank’s inability or unwillingness to lend, we may need to reach a similar agreement with another chartered financial institution or obtain our own bank charter or lending licenses. We may be unable to reach a similar agreement with another partner on favorable terms or at all, and obtaining a bank charter or lending licenses would be a costly, time-consuming and uncertain process, subject us to additional laws and regulatory requirements, which could be burdensome, increase our costs and require us to change our business practices. In addition, as a service provider to these bank partners, which are federally supervised U.S. financial institutions, we are subject from time to time to examination by their federal banking regulators.A case decided in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, Madden v. Midland Funding, LLC (786 F.3d 246 (2d Cir. 2015)), resulted in some uncertainty as to whether non-bank entities purchasing loans originated by a bank may rely on federal preemption of state usury laws, and may create an increased risk of litigation by plaintiffs challenging our ability to collect interest and fees in accordance with the terms of certain loans. Although the decision specifically addressed preemption under the National Bank Act, this decision could support future challenges to federal preemption for other institutions, including FDIC-insured, state chartered industrial banks like those that we rely on to issue our loan products in the U.S. After the Madden decision, there continue to be a number of U.S. state and federal court legal actions challenging the viability of business models where a non-bank entity relies on a third party chartered financial institution in connection with the issuance of credit products. While we believe the manner in which we offer our credit products can be distinguished from Madden, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of any potential litigation, which could materially and adversely impact our ability to issue our loan products in the U.S. and our business. On November 16, 2017, we announced an arrangement under which Synchrony Bank will acquire the U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio held by us and certain of our affiliates, which totaled approximately $6.4 billion in receivables as of December 31, 2017. The purchase price is subject to a post-closing true-up and certain adjustments. The transaction is expected to be completed during the third quarter of 2018, subject to certain closing conditions. The transaction may not close within the expected timeframe or at all. Even if the transaction is consummated, it may take us longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction, and those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Under our expanded program agreement with Synchrony Bank, at the closing of the consumer credit receivables portfolio sale, Synchrony Bank will become the exclusive issuer of the PayPal Credit online consumer financing program in the U.S. for a 10-year term, and we retain an option to designate a purchaser of the portfolio at the end of that term, Our increased reliance on Synchrony will subject us to risks in the nature of those discussed in this “Risk Factors” section under the caption \"We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk.\" 22 Table of Contents Our credit products expose us to additional risks. We offer our PayPal Credit consumer product and PayPal Working Capital and other business loan products to a wide range of consumers and merchants in various markets, and the financial success of these products depends on the effective management of related risk. The credit decisioning process for our PayPal Credit consumer product uses proprietary segmentation and credit algorithms and other analytical techniques designed to analyze the credit risk of specific consumers based on their past purchasing and payment history with PayPal as well as their credit scores. Similarly proprietary risk models and other indicators are applied to assess merchants who wish to use our business loan products to help predict their ability to repay. These risk models may not accurately predict the creditworthiness of a consumer or merchant due to factors such as inaccurate assumptions, including assumptions related to the particular consumer or merchant, market conditions, economic environment or limited transaction history or other data, among other factors. The accuracy of these risk models and the ability to manage credit risk related to our credit products may also be affected by legal or regulatory requirements, competitors’ actions, changes in consumer behavior, changes in the economic environment and other factors. Our international expansion of our credit product offerings also exposes us to additional risks, including those discussed below under the risk factor titled “Our international operations are subject to increased risks, which could harm our business.”Like other businesses with significant exposure to losses from consumer and merchant credit, we face the risk that account holders will default on their payment obligations, creating the risk of potential charge-offs. The non-payment rate among account holders may increase due to, among other things, changes to underwriting standards, worsening economic conditions, such as a recession or government austerity programs, increases in prevailing interest rates, and high unemployment rates. Account holders who miss payments often fail to repay their loans, and account holders who file for protection under the bankruptcy laws generally do not repay their loans.We currently purchase receivables related to our credit products in the U.S. If we are unable to fund our purchase of these receivables adequately or in a cost-effective manner, or if we are unable to efficiently manage the cash resources utilized for these purposes, our business could be harmed. Our business may be impacted by political events, war, terrorism, public health issues, natural disasters and other business interruptions. War, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, public health issues, natural disasters and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to the economy and commerce on a global or regional basis, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, our customers, and companies with which we do business. Our business operations are subject to interruption by, among others, natural disasters, fire, power shortages, earthquakes, floods, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond our control. Such events could decrease demand for our products and services or make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products and services to our customers. In the event of a natural disaster, we could incur significant losses, require substantial recovery time and experience significant expenditures in order to resume or maintain operations, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Changes to our buyer and seller protection programs could increase our loss rate. Our buyer and seller protection programs protect merchants and consumers from fraudulent transactions, and consumers if they do not receive the item ordered or if the item received is significantly different from its description. In 2015, we increased the scope of our buyer protection program to cover digital goods and intangible goods and services. In addition, consumers who pay through PayPal may have reimbursement rights from their payment card issuer (usually a bank), which in turn will seek recovery from us. The risk of losses from our buyer and seller protection programs are specific to individual buyers, sellers and transactions, and may also be impacted by regional variations to these programs, modifications to these programs resulting from changes in regulatory requirements, or changes that we decide to implement, such as expanding the scope of transactions covered by one or more of these programs. Upon PayPal becoming an independent publicly traded company in July 2015, we extended our protection programs in several countries to cover certain customers’ purchases on eBay, and our costs associated with these programs have therefore increased. Increases in our loss rate, including as a result of changing our buyer and seller protection programs, could harm our business. 23 Table of Contents Our international operations are subject to increased risks, which could harm our business. Our international operations have generated approximately one-half of our net revenues in recent years. There are risks inherent in doing business internationally on both a domestic (i.e., in-country) and cross-border basis, including:•foreign currency and cross-border trade risks discussed earlier in this “Risk Factors” section under the captions “We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates” and “Any factors that reduce cross-border trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business”;•risks related to other government regulation or required compliance with local laws;•local licensing and reporting obligations (e.g., data localization requirements);•expenses associated with localizing our products and services, including offering customers the ability to transact business in the local currency, and adapting our products and services to local preferences (e.g., payment methods) with which we may have limited or no experience;•trade barriers and changes in trade regulations;•difficulties in developing, staffing, and simultaneously managing a large number of varying foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences;•stringent local labor laws and regulations;•credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;•profit repatriation restrictions, foreign currency exchange restrictions or extreme fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for a particular currency;•political or social unrest, economic instability, repression, or human rights issues;•geopolitical events, including natural disasters, public health issues, acts of war, and terrorism;•import or export regulations;•compliance with U.S. laws and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, and other local anticorruption laws;•compliance with U.S. and foreign laws designed to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities;•antitrust and competition regulations;•potentially adverse tax developments and consequences;•economic uncertainties relating to sovereign and other debt;•national or regional differences in macroeconomic growth rates;•different, uncertain, overlapping, or more stringent user protection, data protection, privacy, and other laws and regulations; and•increased difficulties in collecting accounts receivable.Violations of the complex foreign and U.S. laws, rules and regulations that apply to our international operations may result in fines, criminal actions, or sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies. These risks are inherent in our international operations and expansion, may increase our costs of doing business internationally, and could harm our business. We are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates. We are exposed to interest rate risk from our investment portfolio and from interest-rate sensitive assets underlying the customer balances we hold on our balance sheet as customer accounts. A low interest rate environment or reductions in interest rates may negatively impact our investment income and our net income. In addition, fluctuations in interest rates may adversely impact our customers’ spending levels and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amounts owed to us. Higher interest rates often lead to higher payment obligations by customers to us and other lenders under mortgage, credit card and other consumer and merchant loans, which may reduce our customers’ ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore lead to increased delinquencies, charge-offs and allowance for loan and interest receivable which could have an adverse effect on our net income.We have entered into a revolving credit facility and a 364-day delayed-draw term loan credit facility. We have borrowed under these credit facilities from time to time, and any borrowings under these credit facilities bear interest at a floating rate, exposing us to interest rate fluctuations. 24 Table of Contents Use of our payments services for illegal purposes could harm our business. Our payment system is susceptible to potentially illegal or improper uses, including money laundering, terrorist financing, illegal online gambling, fraudulent sales of goods or services, illegal sales of prescription medications or controlled substances, piracy of software, movies, music, and other copyrighted or trademarked goods (in particular, digital goods), bank fraud, child pornography trafficking, prohibited sales of alcoholic beverages or tobacco products, online securities fraud, or to facilitate other illegal activity. Any use of our payment system for illegal or improper uses could subject us to claims, individual and class action lawsuits, and government and regulatory investigations, inquiries or requests that could result in liability and reputational harm for us. Moreover, certain activity that may be legal in one country may be illegal in another country, and a merchant may intentionally or inadvertently be found responsible for importing or exporting illegal goods, resulting in liability for us. Changes in law have increased the penalties for intermediaries providing payment services for certain illegal activities, and government authorities may consider additional payments-related proposals from time to time. Owners of intellectual property rights or government authorities may seek to bring legal action against providers of payments solutions, including PayPal, that are peripherally involved in the sale of infringing or allegedly infringing items. Any threatened or resulting claims could result in reputational harm, and any resulting liabilities, loss of transaction volume or increased costs could harm our business. Our failure to manage our customer funds and the assets underlying our customer funds properly could harm our business. We hold a substantial amount of funds belonging to our customers, including deposits in customer accounts and funds being remitted to sellers of goods and services. In certain jurisdictions where we operate, we are required to hold eligible liquid assets, as defined by the relevant regulators in each jurisdiction, equal to at least 100% of the aggregate amount of all customer balances. Our ability to manage and account accurately for the assets underlying our customer funds and comply with applicable liquid asset requirements requires a high level of internal controls. As our business continues to grow and we expand our product offerings, we must continue to strengthen our associated internal controls. PayPal (Europe), with the permission of the CSSF, utilizes certain European customer balances held by our Luxembourg banking subsidiary to fund credit balances relating to our customers. Our success requires significant public confidence in our ability to properly manage our customers’ balances and handle large and growing transaction volumes and amounts of customer funds. Any failure to maintain the necessary controls or to manage our customer funds and the assets underlying our customer funds accurately and in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements could result in reputational harm, lead customers to discontinue or reduce their use of our products and result in significant penalties and fines, which could materially harm our business. We are subject to regulatory activity and antitrust litigation under competition laws. We are subject to scrutiny by various government agencies under U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including antitrust and competition laws. An increasing number of jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. Other companies and government agencies have in the past and may in the future allege that our actions violate the antitrust or competition laws of the U.S., individual states, other countries, or the European Commission, or otherwise constitute unfair competition. An increasing number of governments are regulating and increasing their scrutiny of competition law activities. Our business agreements or arrangements with customers or other companies could give rise to regulatory action or antitrust litigation. Some regulators, particularly those outside of the U.S., may perceive that our products and services are used so broadly that otherwise uncontroversial business practices could be deemed anticompetitive. Any claims or investigations, even if without merit, may be very expensive to defend or respond to, involve negative publicity and substantial diversion of management time and effort, and could result in reputational harm, significant judgments against us, or require us to change our business practices. We are subject to patent litigation. We have repeatedly been sued for allegedly infringing other parties’ patents. At any given time, we are typically a defendant in a number of patent lawsuits and have been notified of several other potential patent disputes. We expect that we will continue to be subject to patent infringement claims because, among other reasons:•our products and services continue to expand in scope and complexity;•we continue to expand into new business areas, including through acquisitions; and•the number of patent owners who may claim that we, any of the companies that we have acquired, or our customers infringe their patents, and the aggregate number of patents controlled by such patent owners, continues to increase.Such claims may be brought directly against us or against our customers whom we may indemnify because we are contractually obligated to do so or we choose to do so as a business matter. We believe that many of the claims against us and other technology companies have been, and continue to be, initiated by third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims. In addition, we have seen significant patent disputes between operating companies in some technology industries. Patent claims, whether meritorious or not, are time-consuming and costly to defend and resolve, and could require us to make expensive changes in our methods of doing business, enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements, make substantial payments to satisfy adverse judgments or settle claims or proceedings, or cease conducting certain operations, which would harm our business. 25 Table of Contents We may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or third parties may allege that we are infringing their intellectual property rights. The protection of our intellectual property, including our trademarks, patents, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, and trade secrets, is important to the success of our business. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on applicable laws and regulations in the U.S. and internationally, as well as a variety of administrative procedures. We also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights when offering or procuring products and services, including confidentiality and invention assignment agreements entered into with our employees and contractors and confidentiality agreements with parties with whom we conduct business.Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we offer our products and services. We may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our rights. Although we have generally taken measures to protect our intellectual property rights, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in protecting or enforcing our rights in every jurisdiction, or that contractual arrangements and other steps that we have taken to protect our intellectual property will prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our intellectual property or deter independent development of equivalent or superior intellectual property rights by others. If we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting, registering or using trademarks and trade dress that infringe, dilute or otherwise violate our trademark rights, the value of our brands could be diminished and our business could be adversely affected. Also, we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. We have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to others. These licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation. Any failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or significant costs incurred in doing so, could diminish the value of our intangible assets and materially harm our business.As the number of products in the technology and payments industries increases and the functionality of these products further overlaps, and as we acquire technology through acquisitions or licenses, we may become increasingly subject to intellectual property infringement and other claims. Litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of the patent and other intellectual property rights of others. The ultimate outcome of any allegation is often uncertain and, regardless of the outcome, any such claim, with or without merit, may be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert management’s time and attention from our business, and require us to, among other things, redesign or stop providing our products or services, pay substantial amounts to satisfy judgments or settle claims or lawsuits, pay substantial royalty or licensing fees, or satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with certain parties with whom we have commercial relationships. Our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights, or litigation or claims arising out of intellectual property matters, may harm our business. We are regularly subject to general litigation, regulatory disputes, and government inquiries. We are regularly subject to claims, individual and class action lawsuits, government and regulatory investigations, inquiries or requests, and other proceedings alleging violations of laws, rules and regulations with respect to competition, antitrust, intellectual property, privacy, data protection, information security, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, sanctions, anti-corruption, consumer protection, fraud, accessibility, securities, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, services, charitable fundraising, contract disputes, escheatment of unclaimed or abandoned property, and other matters. In particular, our business faces ongoing consumer protection and intellectual property litigation, as discussed above. The number and significance of these disputes and inquiries have increased as our business has expanded in scale, scope and geographic reach, and our products and services have increased in complexity. In addition, the laws, rules and regulations affecting our business, including those pertaining to Internet and mobile commerce, payments services, and credit, are subject to ongoing interpretation by the courts and governmental authorities, and the resulting uncertainty in the scope and application of these laws, rules and regulations increases the risk that we will be subject to private claims and governmental actions alleging violations.The scope, outcome and impact of claims, lawsuits, government investigations, and proceedings to which we are subject cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of the outcome, such investigations and proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of management resources, reputational damage, and other factors. Determining reserves for our pending litigation and regulatory proceedings is a complex, fact-intensive process that involves a high degree of judgment. Resolving one or more such legal and regulatory proceedings could potentially require us to make substantial payments to satisfy judgments, fines or penalties or to settle claims or proceedings, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business. These proceedings could also result in reputational harm, criminal sanctions, consent decrees, or orders that prevent us from offering certain products or services, require us to change our business practices in costly ways or develop non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies. Any of these consequences could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.While certain of our customer agreements contain arbitration provisions with class action waiver provisions that may limit our exposure to consumer class action litigation, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in enforcing these arbitration provisions, including the class action waiver provisions, in the future or in any given case. Legislative, administrative or regulatory developments may directly or indirectly prohibit or limit the use of pre-dispute arbitration clauses and class action waiver provisions. Any such prohibitions or limitations on or discontinuation of the use of, such arbitration or class action waiver provisions could subject us to additional lawsuits, including additional consumer class action litigation, and significantly limit our ability to avoid exposure from consumer class action litigation. 26 Table of Contents Changes in U.S. tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations and financial conditions. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive Federal tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act makes changes to the corporate tax rate, business-related deductions and taxation of foreign earnings, among others, that will generally be effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. These changes could have a material adverse impact on the value of our U.S. deferred tax assets, result in significant one-time charges in the current or future taxable years and increase our future U.S. tax expense. We are continuing to evaluate the Tax Act and its requirements, as well as its application to our business and its impact on our effective tax rate. At this stage, it is unclear how many U.S. states will incorporate these federal law changes, or portions thereof, into their tax codes. The implementation by us of new practices and processes designed to comply with, and benefit from, the Tax Act and its rules and regulations could require us to make substantial changes to our business practices, allocate additional resources, and increase our costs, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities. The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation and significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Like many other multinational corporations, we are subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Our determination of our tax liability is always subject to audit and review by applicable domestic and foreign tax authorities, and we are currently undergoing a number of investigations, audits and reviews by taxing authorities throughout the world. Any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could have a negative effect on our business, and the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the periods for which such determination is made. While we have established reserves based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventualities, these reserves may prove to be insufficient.In addition, our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated, or by the incurrence of losses, in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, as a result of gains on our foreign exchange risk management program, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items.Various levels of government, such as U.S. federal and state legislatures, and international organizations, such as the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) and the EU, are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative or regulatory action to increase tax revenue. Any such tax reform or other legislative or regulatory actions could increase our effective tax rate. We and our merchants may be subject to sales reporting and record-keeping obligations. A number of U.S. states, the U.S. federal government and foreign countries have implemented or are in the process of implementing reporting or record-keeping obligations on companies that engage in or facilitate ecommerce to improve tax compliance. Additionally, a number of jurisdictions are reviewing whether payment service providers and other intermediaries could be deemed to be the legal agent of merchants for certain tax purposes. We have modified our systems to meet known requirements and expect further modifications will be required to comply with future requirements, which may negatively impact our customer experience and increase operational costs. Any failure by us to comply with these and similar reporting and record-keeping obligations could result in substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions, adversely impact our ability to do business in certain jurisdictions, and harm our business. 27 Table of Contents Acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic investments, and other strategic transactions could result in operating difficulties and could harm our business. Acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic investments, and other strategic transactions are important elements of our overall corporate strategy. We expect to continue to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions as part of our overall business strategy, including business combinations, acquisitions, and dispositions of certain businesses, technologies, services, products, and other assets, as well as joint ventures, strategic investments, and commercial and strategic partnerships. These transactions may involve significant challenges and risks, including:•the potential loss of key customers, vendors and other key business partners of the companies we acquire, or dispose of, following and continuing after announcement of our transaction plans;•difficulty making strategic hires of new employees, declining employee morale and retention issues affecting employees (particularly the potential loss of key personnel) of companies that we acquire or dispose of, which may result from changes in compensation, management, reporting relationships, future prospects, or the direction of the acquired or disposed business;•diversion of management time and focus;•the need to and difficulty of integrating the operations, systems (including accounting, compliance, management, information, human resource and other administrative systems), technologies, products and personnel of each acquired company, which is an inherently risky and potentially lengthy and costly process;•the need to and difficulty of implementing and/or enhancing controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at acquired companies which, prior to the acquisition, may have lacked such controls, procedures and policies or whose controls, procedures and policies did not meet applicable legal and regulatory standards;•the inefficiencies and lack of control that may result if integration of acquired companies is delayed or not implemented, and unforeseen difficulties and costs that may arise as a result;•potential exposure to new or increased regulatory oversight and regulatory obligations associated with new products and services or entry into new markets;•risks associated with our expansion into new international markets;•risks associated with the complexity of entering into and effectively managing joint ventures, strategic investments, and other strategic partnerships;•risks associated with undetected cyberattacks or security breaches at companies that we acquire or with which we may combine or partner;•lawsuits or regulatory actions resulting from the transaction;•liability for activities or conduct of the acquired company before the acquisition, including legal and regulatory claims or disputes, violations of laws and regulations, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities;•the acquisition of new customer and employee personal information, which in and of itself may require regulatory approval and or additional controls, policies and procedures and subject us to additional exposure and additional complexity and costs of compliance; and•our dependence on the accounting, financial reporting, operating metrics and similar systems, controls and processes of acquired businesses and the risk that errors or irregularities in those systems, controls and processes will lead to errors in our financial statements or make it more difficult to manage the acquired business.At any given time, we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more of these or other types of transactions, any of which could, individually or in the aggregate, be material to our financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying, negotiating, and consummating favorable transaction opportunities. It may take us longer than expected to fully realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions, and those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Any acquisitions or dispositions may also require us to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt (and increased interest expense), recognize liabilities, and record amortization expenses related to intangible assets or write-offs of goodwill or intangibles, which could dilute the economic and voting rights of our stockholders and adversely affect our results of operations and the interests of holders of our indebtedness, as applicable.Joint ventures and minority investment inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, thereby potentially increasing the financial, legal, operational and/or compliance risks associated with the joint venture or minority investment. In addition, we may be dependent on joint venture partners, controlling shareholders, management or other persons or entities who control them and who may have business interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours. Business decisions or other actions or omissions of the joint venture partners, controlling shareholders, management or other persons or entities who control them and who may adversely affect the value of our investment, result in litigation or regulatory action against us and otherwise damage our reputation and brand. 28 Table of Contents There are risks associated with our indebtedness. We have incurred indebtedness, and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations, generate sufficient cash flows to service such debt and the other factors discussed in this “Risk Factors” section. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully. In addition, changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity securities and increase the interest amounts we pay on outstanding or future debt. These risks could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk. We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, including the following:•networks, banks, payment processors, and payment gateways that link us to the payment card and bank clearing networks to process transactions;•unaffiliated third-party lenders to originate loans in the U.S. for our PayPal Credit consumer product. PayPal Working Capital and other business loan products;•third parties that provide loan servicing and customer statements processing;•third parties that provide certain outsourced customer support and product development functions, which are critical to our operations; and•third parties that provide facilities, infrastructure, components and services, including data center facilities and cloud computing.Because we rely on third parties to provide services to us and our customers and to facilitate certain of our business activities, we face increased operational risk. These third parties may be subject to financial, legal, regulatory, labor or other issues, such as service terminations, disruptions or interruptions, that prevent them from providing services to us or our customers. Moreover, these third parties are themselves subject to the risks discussed earlier in the \"Risk Factors\" section under the caption \"Our business is subject to cyberattacks and security and privacy breaches.\" In addition, these third parties may breach their agreements with us, disagree with our interpretation of contract terms or applicable laws and regulations, refuse to continue or renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms or at all, fail or refuse to process transactions adequately, take actions that degrade the functionality of our services, impose additional costs or requirements on us, or give preferential treatment to competitive services. There can be no assurance that third parties who provide services directly to us or our customers will continue to do so on acceptable terms, or at all. If any third parties were to stop providing services to us or our customers on acceptable terms, we may be unable to procure alternatives from other third parties in a timely and efficient manner, and on acceptable terms or at all. If third parties we rely on do not adequately or appropriately provide their services or perform their responsibilities, we may be subject to business disruptions, losses or costs to remediate any of the deficiencies, customer dissatisfaction, reputational damage, legal or regulatory proceedings, or other adverse consequences which could harm our business. Our developer platforms, which are open to merchants and third-party developers, subject us to additional risks. We provide third-party developers with access to application programming interfaces, software development kits and other tools designed to allow them to produce applications for use, with a particular focus on mobile applications. There can be no assurance that merchants or third-party developers will develop and maintain applications and services on our open platforms on a timely basis or at all, and a number of factors could cause such third-party developers to curtail or stop development for our platforms. In addition, our business is subject to many regulatory restrictions. It is possible that merchants and third-party developers who utilize our development platforms or tools could violate these regulatory restrictions and we may be held responsible for such violations, which could harm our business. Our retail point of sale solutions expose us to additional risks. We have announced several retail point of sale solutions, which enable merchants to accept payments using a payments card reader attached to, or otherwise communicating with, a mobile device or to scan payment cards and codes using the mobile device’s embedded camera, and which enable consumers to use their mobile devices to pay at the point of sale. We have entered into strategic partnerships with major payment card networks to further expand our relationship in a way that will make it easier for merchants to accept and consumers to choose to pay for transactions utilizing these companies' credit and debit cards. Those agreements provide us with access to each of these partner's tokenization services in the U.S. for in-store point-of-sale PayPal transactions, which we expect will increase the number of point of sale transactions that we process. As we continue to expand our product and service offerings at the retail point of sale, we will face additional risks, including:•increased expectations from offline retailers regarding the reliability and availability of our systems and services and correspondingly lower amounts of downtime, which we may not be able to meet;•significant competition at the retail point of sale, particularly from established payment card providers , many of which have substantially greater resources than we do;•increased targeting by fraudsters; given that our fraud models are less developed in this area, we may experience increases in fraud and associated transaction losses as we adjust to fraudulent activity at the point of sale;•exposure to product liability claims to the extent that hardware devices that we produce for use at the retail point of sale malfunction or are not in compliance with laws, which could result in substantial liability and require product recalls or other actions;•exposure to additional laws, rules and regulations;•increased reliance on third parties involved with processing in-store payments, including independent software providers, electronic point of sale providers, hardware providers (such as cash register and pin-pad providers), payment processors and banks that enable in-store transactions; and•lower operating income than our other payment solutions.Unless we are able to successfully manage these risks, including driving adoption of, and significant volume through, our retail point of sale solutions over time, our business may be harmed. 29 Table of Contents Our success largely depends on key personnel. Because competition for our key employees is intense, we may not be able to attract, retain, and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our business. The loss of key personnel could harm our business. Our future performance depends substantially on the continued services of key personnel, including our executive team and other highly skilled employees, and our ability to attract, retain, and motivate such personnel. Competition for key personnel is intense, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area, where our corporate headquarters are located and where the cost of living is high, and we may be unable to successfully attract, integrate, or retain sufficiently qualified key personnel. In making employment decisions, particularly in the technology and payments industries, job candidates often consider the value of the equity awards they would receive in connection with their employment, and fluctuations in our stock price, or a perception that the market price of our stock may not increase or may increase more slowly than stock prices at other technology or payments companies, may make it more difficult to attract, retain, and motivate employees. We may be limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws or policies. In addition, we do not have long-term employment agreements with any of our key personnel and do not maintain any “key person” life insurance policies. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel, or our inability to attract highly qualified key personnel, could harm our business. We are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our products and services. Companies providing online services may be subject to claims relating to information disseminated through them, including claims alleging defamation, libel, harassment, hate speech, breach of contract, invasion of privacy, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, among other things. The laws relating to the liability of companies providing online services for information disseminated through their services are subject to frequent challenges. We are also subject to potential liability to third parties for the customer-provided content on our products and services, particularly in jurisdictions outside the U.S. where the applicable laws are unsettled. If we become liable for information provided by our customers and carried on our products and services, we could be directly harmed and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability, including expending substantial resources or discontinuing certain product or service offerings, which could harm our business. Risks Related to the Separation from eBay If the distribution, together with certain related transactions, does not qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), eBay, PayPal and eBay stockholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities and, in certain circumstances, we could be required to indemnify eBay for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement. On July 17, 2015, we became an independent publicly traded company through the pro rata distribution by eBay Inc. of 100% of our outstanding common stock to eBay’s stockholders (which we sometimes refer to as the “separation” or the “distribution”). eBay received an opinion from its outside legal counsel regarding the qualification of the distribution, together with certain related transactions, as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code. The opinion was based on and relied on, among other things, certain facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements and undertakings of eBay and of us, including those relating to the past and future conduct of eBay and of us. If any of these representations, statements or undertakings were, or became, inaccurate or incomplete, or if eBay or we breach any of our respective covenants in the separation documents, the opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized.Notwithstanding the opinion of counsel, the IRS could determine that the distribution, together with certain related transactions, should be treated as a taxable transaction if the IRS determines that any of these representations, assumptions, or undertakings upon which such opinion was based are incorrect or have been violated or if the IRS disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel. An opinion of counsel is not binding on the IRS or any court and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge the conclusions reached in the opinion. The IRS did not provide any opinion in advance of the separation that our proposed transaction is tax-free.If the distribution, together with certain related transactions, failed to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code, in general, eBay would recognize taxable gain as if it had sold the PayPal common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value, eBay stockholders who received PayPal common stock in the distribution may be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares and we could incur significant liabilities. 30 Table of Contents There are risks associated with certain agreements that we entered into with eBay at the separation. In connection with the separation, we entered into a separation and distribution agreement with eBay as well as various other agreements, including an operating agreement, a tax matters agreement, an employee matters agreement, an intellectual property matters agreement, a data sharing addendum, and a product development agreement. The separation agreement, the tax matters agreement, the employee matters agreement, and the intellectual property matters agreement determine the allocation of assets and liabilities (including by means of licensing) between the companies following the separation for those respective areas and include associated indemnification obligations. The operating agreement, the data sharing addendum and the product development agreement establish certain commercial relationships between eBay and us related to payment processing, credit and data sharing. If we or eBay is unable to satisfy its performance, payment or indemnification obligations under these agreements, we could incur operational difficulties or losses or be required to make substantial indemnification or other payments to eBay. Our relationship with eBay is governed in part by an operating agreement entered into at separation with a term of five years. This operating agreement defines a number of important elements of our commercial relationship with eBay, as well as certain obligations and limitations that limit PayPal’s provision of services to certain competitive platform operators of eBay (as specified in the operating agreement). eBay remains a significant source of our revenues and operating income. If our operating agreement with eBay expires or is terminated prior to its expiration, or if there is a significant change in our relationship with eBay, including if eBay becomes a merchant of record, eliminates or modifies any of its risk management or customer protection programs, directs transactions to a different provider of payment services or offers eBay customers alternative payment options, it could lead to customer dissatisfaction, reputational damage, and other adverse consequences, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed. Risks Related to Our Common Stock The price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly. The price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including, but not limited to:•actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;•changes in financial estimates by us or securities analysts and recommendations by securities analysts;•changes in our capital structure;•speculation, coverage or sentiment in the media or the investment community;•the operating and stock price performance of comparable companies;•changes to the regulatory and legal environment under which we operate; and•market conditions or trends in the payments industry, the industries of merchants and the domestic and worldwide economy as a whole. 31 Table of Contents Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the state courts of the State of Delaware, or, if no state court located in the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the District of Delaware, as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could discourage lawsuits against us and our directors and officers. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that unless the corporation otherwise determines, the state courts of the State of Delaware, or, if no state court located in the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the District of Delaware, will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors or officers to us or our stockholders, any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“DGCL”) or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes with us or our directors or officers, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors and officers. Alternatively, if a court outside of Delaware were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above, we could incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may prevent or delay an acquisition of our company, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock. Certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of deterring coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and by encouraging prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others:•rules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings;•the fact that directors may not be elected, removed or replaced at stockholder-requested special meetings unless a person, entity or group owns at least a majority of our outstanding common stock;•the right of our board to issue preferred stock and to determine the voting, dividend and other rights of preferred stock without stockholder approval;•the ability of our directors, and not stockholders, to fill vacancies on our board of directors in most circumstances and to determine the size of our board of directors;•the prohibition on stockholders acting by written consent; and•the absence of cumulative rights in the election of directors.We have also elected not to be governed by Section 203 of the DGCL, which provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that acquire, or are affiliated with a person that acquires, more than 15% of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the date on which that person or its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15% of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, however, contains a provision that generally mirrors Section 203 of the DGCL, except that it provides for a 20% threshold instead of the 15% provided for by the DGCL. These provisions could delay or prevent a change of control that our stockholders may favor.These provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers. However, these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and may delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in the best interests of us and our stockholders. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. 32 Table of Contents We own and lease various properties in the U.S. and other countries around the world. We use the properties for executive and administrative offices, data centers, product development offices and customer service offices. As of December 31, 2017, our owned and leased properties provided us with aggregate square footage as follows: United States Other Countries Total (In millions)Owned facilities1.2 — 1.2Leased facilities1.1 1.6 2.7Total facilities2.3 1.6 3.9 We own a total of 22 acres of land in the U.S. Our corporate headquarters are located in San Jose, California and occupy approximately 0.7 million of owned square feet.

Separation from eBay Inc. On September 30, 2014, eBay Inc. (“eBay”) announced its intent to separate its payments business into an independent, publicly traded company. To accomplish this separation, in January 2015, eBay incorporated PayPal Holdings, Inc. (“PayPal Holdings”) which is now the parent of PayPal, Inc. and holds directly or indirectly all of the assets and liabilities associated with PayPal, Inc. In June 2015, the board of directors of eBay approved the separation (the “separation”) of eBay's payments business through the distribution (the “distribution”) of 100% of the outstanding common stock of PayPal Holdings to eBay's stockholders. PayPal Holdings' registration statement on Form 10, as amended, was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on June 29, 2015. On July 17, 2015 (the “distribution date”), PayPal Holdings became an independent publicly traded company through the pro rata distribution by eBay of 100% of the outstanding common stock of PayPal Holdings to eBay stockholders. Each eBay stockholder of record as of the close of business on July 8, 2015 received one share of PayPal Holdings common stock for every share of eBay common stock held on the record date. Approximately 1.2 billion shares of PayPal Holdings common stock were distributed on July 17, 2015 to eBay stockholders. PayPal Holdings' common stock began “regular way” trading under the ticker symbol “PYPL” on the NASDAQ Stock Market on July 20, 2015.Prior to the separation, eBay transferred substantially all of the assets and liabilities and operations of eBay's payments business to PayPal Holdings, which was completed in June 2015 (the “capitalization”). The consolidated financial statements prior to the capitalization were prepared on a stand-alone basis and were derived from eBay's consolidated financial statements and accounting records. The consolidated financial statements reflect our financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income and cash flows as our business was operated as part of eBay prior to the capitalization. Following the capitalization, our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PayPal Holdings and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of dates and for periods prior to the separation may not be indicative of what our financial position, results of operations and cash flows would have been as a separate stand-alone entity during the periods presented, nor are they indicative of what our financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be in the future. For additional information, see “Note 1—Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires, references to “we,” “our,” “us,” “the Company” and “PayPal” refer to PayPal Holdings and its consolidated subsidiaries or, in the case of information as of dates or for periods prior to the separation, the consolidated entities of the payments business of eBay, including PayPal, Inc. and certain other assets and liabilities that had been historically held at the eBay corporate level but were specifically identifiable and attributable to the payments business. Business Environment We are a leading technology platform and digital payments company that enables digital and mobile payments on behalf of consumers and merchants worldwide. Our vision is to democratize financial services, as we believe that managing and moving money is a right for all people, not just the affluent. Our goal is to increase our relevance for consumers and merchants to manage and move their money anywhere in the world, anytime, on any platform and using any device. Our combined payment solutions, including our PayPal, PayPal Credit, Braintree, Venmo, Xoom, and Paydiant products, compose our proprietary Payments Platform.We operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened regulatory focus on all aspects of the payments industry. That focus continues to become even more heightened as regulators on a global basis focus on such important issues as countering terrorist financing, anti-money laundering, privacy and consumer protection. Some of the laws and regulations to which we are subject were enacted recently, and the laws and regulations applicable to us, including those enacted prior to the advent of digital and mobile payments, are continuing to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation. Non-compliance with laws and regulations, increased penalties and enforcement actions related to non-compliance, changes in laws and regulations or their interpretation, and the enactment of new laws and regulations applicable to us could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Therefore, we monitor these areas closely to ensure compliant solutions for our customers who depend on us.The United Kingdom (\"U.K.\") held a referendum in June 2016 in which a majority of voters approved an exit from the European Union (\"EU\") (“Brexit”). In March 2017, the U.K. government gave formal notice of its intention to leave the EU and started the process of negotiating the future terms of the U.K.'s relationship with the EU. Brexit could adversely affect U.K., regional (including European) and worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the British Pound and Euro. We have foreign exchange exposure management programs designed to help reduce the impact from foreign currency rate movements. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, net revenues generated from our U.K. operations constituted 11%, 12% and 13%, respectively, of total net revenues. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, net revenues generated from the EU (excluding the U.K.) constituted approximately 20% of total net revenues. For additional information on how Brexit could affect our business, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” under the caption—“The United Kingdom’s departure from the EU could adversely affect us.” Information security risks for global payments and technology companies have significantly increased in recent years. Although we are not aware of any material impacts relating to cyberattacks or other information security breaches on our Payments Platform, we are not immune to these risks and there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” under the caption—“Our business is subject to cyberattacks and security and privacy breaches.” 36 Table of Contents Overview of Results of Operations The following table provides a summary of our consolidated operating results for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015: Year Ended December 31, Percent Increase/(Decrease) 2017 2016 2015 2017 2016 (In millions, except percentages and per share amounts)Net revenues$13,094 $10,842 $9,248 21 % 17 %Operating expenses10,967 9,256 7,787 18 % 19 %Operating income2,127 1,586 1,461 34 % 9 %Operating margin16% 15% 16% ** **Income tax expense405 230 260 76 % (12)%Effective tax rate18% 14% 17% ** **Net income$1,795 $1,401 $1,228 28 % 14 %Net income per diluted share(1)(2)$1.47 $1.15 $1.00 28 % 15 %Net cash provided by operating activities$2,531 $3,158 $2,546 (20)% 24 % All amounts in tables are rounded to the nearest millions, except as otherwise noted. As a result, certain amounts may not recalculate using the rounded amounts provided.(1) On July 17, 2015, the distribution date, eBay stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 8, 2015 received one share of PayPal common stock for every share of eBay common stock held as of the record date.(2) The weighted average number of common shares outstanding for diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2015 was based on the number of common shares distributed on July 17, 2015 for the period prior to distribution and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period beginning after the distribution date. ** Not MeaningfulNet revenues increased $2.3 billion, or 21%, in 2017 and $1.6 billion, or 17%, in 2016. The increases were primarily driven by growth in TPV (as defined below under “Net Revenues”) of 27% in 2017 and 26% in 2016. Net revenues from our recent acquisitions of TIO and Swift were not material. Net revenues from Xoom (acquired in November 2015) contributed two percentage points to the 2016 growth rate. Total operating expenses increased $1.7 billion, or 18%, in 2017 and $1.5 billion or 19% in 2016. The increase in 2017 was due primarily to an increase in transaction expense, sales and marketing, general and administrative, product development, and restructuring and other charges. Operating expenses related to TIO and Swift collectively contributed one percentage point to the 2017 growth rate. The increase in total operating expense in 2016 was due primarily to an increase in transaction expense and transaction and loan losses which increase with TPV and higher customer support and operations, general and administrative expenses, and depreciation and amortization incurred to operate as an independent public company, partially offset by a decrease in restructuring expense. Xoom operating expenses contributed three percentage points to the 2016 growth rate. Operating income increased $541 million, or 34%, in 2017 and $125 million, or 9% in 2016. Operating income increased in 2017 and 2016 due primarily to the increase in net revenues, partially offset by the growth in operating expenses. TIO and Swift collectively had a negative impact our 2017 growth rate of four percentage points. Xoom negatively impacted our 2016 growth rate by four percentage points. Our operating margin was 16%, 15% and 16% in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Operating margin in 2017 was negatively impacted by growth in our transaction expense which increased 32% in 2017 compared to 2016, compared to net revenues which increased 21% in the same period, as well as restructuring expense of $40 million incurred in 2017. These impacts were offset by operating efficiencies in our business, and a one time benefit of $322 million pertaining to reversal of allowances related to loans and interest receivables due to the designation as held for sale of our U.S. consumer credit portfolio. Operating margin decreased in 2016 due primarily to growth in our transaction expense and transaction and loan losses, which together increased 30% in 2016 compared to 2015.Net income increased by $394 million, or 28%, in 2017 and $173 million, or 14%, in 2016. The increase in net income in 2017 was attributable to an increase in operating income of $541 million and an increase in other income (expense), net of $28 million, partially offset by an increase in income tax expense of $175 million. The increase in net income in 2016 was attributable to an increase in operating income of $125 million, a decrease in income tax expense of $30 million and an increase in other income (expense), net of $18 million. 37 Table of Contents Non-GAAP financial measures The following table provides a summary of our consolidated non-GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015: Year Ended December 31, Percent Increase/(Decrease) 2017 2016 2015 2017 2016 (In millions, except percentages and per share amounts)Non-GAAP net revenues$13,055 $10,842 $9,248 20 % 17 %Non-GAAP operating income$2,755 $2,174 $1,975 27 % 10 %Non-GAAP operating margin21% 20% 21% ** ** Non-GAAP income tax expense$510 $394 $402 29 % (2)%Non-GAAP net income$2,318 $1,825 $1,588 27 % 15 %Non-GAAP net income per diluted share(1)(2)$1.90 $1.50 $1.29 27 % 16 %Free Cash Flow$1,864 $2,489 $1,824 (25)% 36 % All amounts in tables are rounded to the nearest millions, except as otherwise noted.

For information on how we compute these non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, please refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Information” below. 38 Table of Contents Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange Rates We have significant operations internationally that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar, subjecting us to foreign currency risk which may adversely impact our financial results. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar versus the British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar, as well as other currencies in which we conduct our international operations, impacts the translation of our net revenues and expenses generated in these foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, we generated approximately 46%, 47% and 50% of our net revenues from customers domiciled outside of the United States, respectively. During each of these periods, U.K. was the only country, other than the United States, where we generated more than 10% of total net revenues in. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, net revenues generated from the EU (excluding the U.K.) constituted approximately 20% of total net revenues. Because we have generated substantial net revenues internationally in recent periods, including during the periods presented, we are subject to the risks of doing business in countries outside of the U.S. as discussed under “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition.” We calculate the year-over-year impact of foreign currency movements on our business using prior period foreign currency exchange rates applied to current period transactional currency amounts. While changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported results, we have a foreign currency exchange exposure management program whereby we designate certain foreign currency exchange contracts as cash flow hedges designed to reduce the impact on earnings from foreign currency exchange rate movements. Gains and losses from these foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized as a component of transaction revenues in the same period the forecasted transactions impact earnings. In the years ended December 31, 2017 and , the year-over-year foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar had the following impact on our reported results: 2016 Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 (In millions)Favorable (Unfavorable) impact to net revenues (exclusive of hedging impact)$10 $(196)Hedging impact17 119Favorable (Unfavorable) impact to net revenues 27 (77)(Unfavorable) Favorable impact to operating expense(21) 86Net impact to operating income$6 $9 While we enter into foreign exchange contracts to help reduce the impact on earnings from foreign currency rate movements, it is impossible to predict or eliminate the total effects of this exposure. Additionally, in connection with our services in multiple currencies, we generally set our foreign currency exchange rates twice per day, and may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign currency exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the times that we set our foreign currency exchange rates. Given that we also have foreign currency exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries, we have an additional foreign currency exchange exposure management program whereby we use foreign currency exchange contracts to offset the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency gains and losses on our assets and liabilities are recorded in other income (expense), net, and are offset by the gains and losses on the foreign currency exchange contracts. These foreign currency exchange contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. Financial Results Net revenues Revenue description We earn revenue primarily by processing customer transactions on our Payments Platform and from other value added services. Our revenues are classified into the following two categories:•Transaction revenues: Net transaction fees charged to consumers and merchants primarily based on the volume of activity, or Total Payments Volume (“TPV”), processed through our Payments Platform. We define TPV as the value of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed through our Payments Platform, excluding transactions processed through our gateway and Paydiant products. Growth in TPV is directly impacted by the number of payment transactions that we enable on our Payments Platform. Payment transactions are the total number of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed through our Payments Platform, excluding transactions processed through our gateway and Paydiant products. We earn additional fees on transactions settled in foreign currencies when we enable cross-border transactions (i.e., transactions where the merchant or consumer are in different countries).•Other value added services: Net revenues derived principally from interest and fees earned on our loans and interest receivable, net and held for sale portfolio, subscription fees, gateway fees, gains on sale of participation interests in certain consumer loans receivable and working capital loans and advances, revenue share we earn through partnerships, interest earned on certain PayPal customer account balances, fees earned through our Paydiant products and other services that we provide to consumers and merchants.Our revenues can be significantly impacted by the following:•The mix of merchants, products and services;•The mix between domestic and cross-border transactions;•The geographic region or country in which a transaction occurs; and•The amount of PayPal credit loans receivable outstanding with consumers and merchants. 39 Table of Contents Net revenues analysis The components of our net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows: Year Ended December 31, Percent Increase/(Decrease) 2017 2016 2015 2017 2016 (In millions, except percentages)Transaction revenues$11,402 $9,490 $8,128 20% 17%Other value added services1,692 1,352 1,120 25% 21%Net revenues$13,094 $10,842 $9,248 21% 17% Transaction revenues Transaction revenues increased by $1.9 billion, or 20%, in 2017 compared to 2016, and by $1.4 billion, or 17%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in transaction revenues in 2017 and 2016 was due primarily to the growth in TPV, mainly from our PayPal and Braintree products, and in the number of payment transactions, both of which were due primarily to an increase in our active customer accounts and increased engagement from our customers (measured by payment transactions per active account). Xoom transaction revenues contributed two percentage points to the 2016 growth rate. Net gains from our foreign currency exchange contracts recognized as a component of transaction revenues in 2017 were $17 million, compared to $119 million in 2016. Refer to “Note 8—Derivative Instruments” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our foreign currency exposure management program. The following table provides a summary of our active customer accounts, number of payment transactions, TPV and related metrics: 40 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, Percent Increase/(Decrease) 2017 2016 2015 2017 2016 (In millions, except percentages)Active customer accounts(1)227 197 179 15% 10%Number of payment transactions(2)7,606 6,129 4,928 24% 24%Payment transactions per active account(3)33.6 31.1 27.5 8% 13%Total TPV(4)$451,265 $354,014 $281,764 27% 26%Percent of cross-border TPV21% 22% 22% ** ** All amounts in tables are rounded to the nearest millions except as otherwise noted. As a result, certain amounts may not recalculate using the rounded amounts provided.(1) An active customer account is a registered account that successfully sent or received at least one payment or payment reversal through our Payments Platform, excluding transactions processed through our gateway and Paydiant products, in the past 12 months.(2) Payment transactions are the total number of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed through our Payments Platform, excluding transactions processed through our gateway and Paydiant products.(3) Number of payment transactions per active customer account reflects the total number of payment transactions within the previous 12 month period, divided by active customer accounts at the end of the period.(4) TPV is the value of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed through our Payments Platform, excluding transactions processed through our gateway and Paydiant products. ** Not meaningfulTransaction revenues grew more slowly than both TPV and number of payment transactions in 2017 due primarily to a higher proportion of person-to-person (“P2P”) transactions, primarily from our PayPal and Venmo products from which we earn lower rates and foreign exchange hedging losses. The percentage growth in transaction revenues was lower than the percentage growth in TPV and payment transactions in 2016 primarily due to a higher proportion of P2P transactions (including our Venmo products) for which we earn lower rates, and a higher portion of TPV generated by large merchants who generally pay lower rates with higher transaction volume. The impact of increases or decreases in prices charged to our customers did not significantly impact transaction revenue growth in 2017 or 2016. Other value added services Net revenues from other value added services increased by $340 million, or 25%, in 2017 compared to 2016, and by $232 million, or 21%, in 2016 compared to 2015. Growth in net revenues from other value-added services in 2017 was due primarily to interest and fee income earned on our PayPal credit loans receivable portfolio. Swift revenues contributed approximately three percentage points to the 2017 growth rate. The total consumer and merchant loans receivable balance, including loans and receivables, held for sale, as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 was $7.8 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 37%. In November 2017, we reached an agreement to sell our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio to Synchrony Bank, which we believe will enable us, at closing, to free up balance sheet capacity and cash flow for other uses, and mitigate balance sheet risk. Historically, this portfolio was reported as outstanding principal balances, net of any participation interest sold and pro-rata allowances including, unamortized deferred origination costs and estimated collectible interest and fees. Upon approval of the decision to sell these receivables from our Board of Directors, the portfolio was reclassified as held for sale, and recorded at the lower of cost or fair value. Due to the designation as held for sale, the associated allowance for this portfolio was reversed, resulting in an increase of approximately $39 million in revenue from other value added services. This transaction will be accounted for as a sale, and the receivables will no longer be reported in our consolidated financial statements Following the closing of this transaction, which is expected to occur in the third quarter of 2018, Synchrony Bank will become the exclusive issuer of the PayPal Credit online consumer financing program in the U.S., and we will no longer hold an ownership interest in the receivables generated through the program (other than charged off receivables). In addition, we will earn a profit share on the portfolio of consumer receivables owned by Synchrony Bank. Growth in net revenues from other value added services in 2016 was due primarily to interest and fee income earned on our PayPal Credit loans receivable portfolio. The total consumer and merchant loans receivable balance as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $5.7 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 29%.In the third quarter of 2015, we amended the terms of our credit program agreement with Synchrony Bank. As a result of the amendment, we recognized $78 million of revenue under the agreement during 2015. In addition, as part of the amended agreement, our obligation to purchase the portfolio of consumer loan receivables relating to the customer accounts arising out of the credit program agreement with Synchrony Bank was terminated. The amended credit program agreement will, upon closing of the sale of our U.S. consumer credit receivable portfolio to Synchrony Bank, be superseded by the new program agreement signed in November 2017. In the second quarter of 2015, we completed an arrangement with certain investors under which we sold participation interests in certain consumer loans and interest receivables related to our PayPal Credit product with a gross book value of approximately $708 million. In connection with its purchase of our U.S. consumer credit receivable portfolio, Synchrony Bank has also agreed to acquire the participation interests held by the investors. 41 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Beginning with the first quarter of 2016, we reclassified certain operating expenses in our consolidated statements of income to better align our external and internal financial reporting. These classification changes relate primarily to real estate and information technology operating expenses that were previously allocated among customer support and operations expense, sales and marketing expense and product development expense. Our management no longer allocates these operating expenses for internal financial reporting purposes or general management of the business and has therefore discontinued this allocation for external financial reporting purposes. As a result, starting with the first quarter of 2016 these operating expenses were reported as part of general and administrative expenses. These changes have no impact on the previously reported consolidated net income for prior periods, including total operating expenses, financial position or cash flows for any periods presented, and do not eliminate any of the costs allocated to us by eBay for any periods prior to the separation. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. See “Note 1—Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the effects of the changes on the presentation of operating expenses to our previously reported consolidated statement of income. Growth rates presented below are calculated based upon the reclassified prior period amounts. The following table summarizes our operating expenses and related metrics we use to assess the trend in each: Year Ended December 31, Percent Increase/(Decrease) 2017 2016 2015 2017 2016 (In millions, except percentages)Transaction expense$4,419 $3,346 $2,610 32 % 28%Transaction and loan losses1,011 1,088 809 (7)% 34%Customer support and operations1,364 1,267 1,110 8 % 14%Sales and marketing1,128 969 937 16 % 3%Product development953 834 792 14 % 5%General and administrative1,155 1,028 873 12 % 18%Depreciation and amortization805 724 608 11 % 19%Restructuring and other charges132 — 48 ** ** Total operating expenses$10,967 $9,256 $7,787 18 % 19%Transaction expense rate(1)0.98% 0.95% 0.93% Transaction and loan loss rate(2)0.22% 0.31% 0.29% (1) Transaction expense rate is calculated by dividing transaction expense by TPV (2) Transaction and loan loss rate is calculated by dividing transaction and loan losses by TPV** Not Meaningful Transaction expense Transaction expense is primarily composed of the costs we incur to accept a customer’s funding source of payment. These costs include fees paid to payment processors and other financial institutions in order to draw funds from a customer’s credit or debit card, bank account or other funding source they have stored in their digital wallet. Transaction expense also includes fees paid to disbursement partners to enable a transaction and interest expense on borrowings incurred to finance our portfolio of loans receivable arising from our PayPal Credit funding option. We refer to the allocation of funding sources used by our consumers as our “funding mix.” The cost of funding a transaction with a credit or debit card is generally higher than the cost of funding a transaction from a bank or through internal sources such as a PayPal account balance or PayPal Credit. As we expand the availability of alternative funding sources to our customers, a change in funding mix can increase or decrease our transaction expense rate. The cost of funding a transaction is also impacted by the geographic region or country in which a transaction occurs because we generally pay lower rates for transactions funded with credit cards outside the U.S. than in the U.S. Transaction expense increased by $1.1 billion, or 32%, in 2017 compared to 2016, and increased by $736 million, or 28%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in transaction expense in 2017 was primarily attributable to an increase in TPV of 27% and higher assessments charged by payment processors and other financial institutions. The increase in transaction expense in 2016 was primarily attributable to an increase in TPV of 26%. The increase in our transaction expense rate in 2017 compared to 2016 was due primarily to higher assessments charged by payment processors and other financial institutions. Our transaction expense rate in 2016 increased compared to 2015 due primarily to changes in funding mix. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, approximately 2% of TPV was funded with PayPal Credit. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, approximately 44%, 45%, and 45% of TPV, respectively, was generated outside of the U.S. Interest expense on borrowings incurred to finance our portfolio of loans receivable, included in transaction expense, was not material for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. 42 Table of Contents Transaction and loan losses Transaction losses include the expense associated with our customer protection programs, fraud, and chargebacks. Loan losses include the losses associated with our consumer and merchant loans receivable portfolio, except loans and interest receivable, held for sale. Our transaction and loan losses fluctuate depending on many factors, including TPV, macroeconomic conditions, changes to our customer protection programs, the impact of regulatory changes, and the credit quality of loans receivable arising from transactions funded with our credit products for consumers and loans and advances to merchant sellers. Additionally, prior to the distribution we recovered certain amounts from eBay related to customer protection programs offered on eligible eBay purchases made with PayPal. These costs included the actual amount of protection losses associated with eBay's customer protection programs that we administered and funded on behalf of eBay, which were included as a reduction of transaction and loan losses. Recoveries associated with protection losses incurred on eligible eBay purchases during the year ended December 31, 2015 were $27 million. Following the distribution, we no longer administer eBay's customer protection programs or recover amounts from eBay associated with protection losses incurred on eligible eBay purchases; instead, we and eBay each independently administer our own customer protection programs. Further, our customer protection programs extend to customers’ eligible purchases on eBay and therefore we have incurred and expect to continue to incur incremental costs associated with our customer protection programs following the distribution.The components of our transaction and loan losses for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows: Year Ended December 31, Percent Increase/(Decrease) 2017 2016 2015 2017 2016 (In millions, except percentages)Transaction losses$823 $655 $511 26 % 28%Loan losses188 433 298 (57)% 45%Transaction and loan losses$1,011 $1,088 $809 (7)% 34% Transaction and loan losses decreased by $77 million, or 7%, in 2017 compared to 2016, and increased by $279 million, or 34%, in 2016 compared to 2015. Transaction losses increased by $168 million, or 26%, in 2017 compared to 2016, and increased by $144 million, or 28%, in 2016 compared to 2015, due primarily to higher TPV. Our transaction loss rate, calculated by dividing transaction loss by TPV, in 2017 and 2016 was roughly flat compared to 2016 and 2015, respectively. The growth in transaction losses in 2016 was higher than the growth in TPV in 2016 due primarily to lower incremental costs in 2015 associated with our customer protection programs following the distribution.Loan losses decreased by $245 million, or 57%, in 2017 compared to 2016 and increased by $135 million, or 45%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease in loan losses in 2017 was due primarily to the reversal of approximately $283 million of allowance on loans receivable due to the designation of our U.S. consumer credit portfolio as held for sale. The increase in loan losses in 2016 was due primarily to an increase in the loans receivable balance year over year and additional reserves recorded in that period due to increases to forecasted principal balance delinquency rates. The total consumer loans receivable balance as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $326 million, $5.1 billion, and $4.0 billion, respectively, reflecting year-over-year decrease of 94% from 2016 to 2017 and an increase of 28% from 2015 to 2016. The decrease in consumer loan receivables in 2017 was due to designation of U.S. consumer credit portfolio as held for sale. The increase in consumer loans receivable in 2016 was due to the growth in the portfolio of loans receivable outstanding arising from consumers who chose PayPal Credit as a funding option and an increase in working capital advances to selected merchant sellers. The following table provides information regarding the credit quality of our pool of consumer loans and interest receivable balances: 43 Table of Contents December 31, 2017 2016Percent of consumer loans and interest receivables current(1)96.0% 90.0%Percent of consumer loans and interest receivables > 90 days outstanding(1)(2)1.2% 4.1%Net charge off rate(1)(3)3.9% 6.4% (1) Amounts as of December 31, 2017 represent loans and interest receivables due from consumer accounts not classified as held for sale and amounts as of December 31, 2016 represent total consumer loans and interest receivables including U.S. consumer receivables because they were not classified as held for sale as of that date. (2) Represents percentage of balances which are 90 days past the billing date to the consumer.(3) Net charge off rate is the annual ratio of net credit losses on consumer loans receivables as a percentage of the average daily amount of consumer loans and interest receivables balance during the year. Through our PayPal Working Capital product, we offer credit products to certain small and medium-sized merchants that are existing users of our other payment services. Total PayPal Working Capital loans, advances and fees receivable outstanding as of December 31, 2017, net of participation interest sold, were $703 million. Total PayPal Working Capital loans, advances and fees receivable outstanding as of December 31, 2016 were $558 million, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 26% due to the increase in the availability of our credit products domestically and internationally. To assess a merchant who requests a PayPal Working Capital loan or advance, we use, among other indicators, an internally developed risk model that we refer to as our PayPal Working Capital Risk Model (“PRM”), as a credit quality indicator to help predict the merchant's ability to repay the amount of the loan or advance and fixed fee. The PRM uses multiple variables as predictors of the merchant's ability to repay a working capital loan or advance. Primary drivers of the model include the merchant's annual payment volume and payment processing history with PayPal, prior repayment history with the PayPal Working Capital product, and other measures. Merchants are assigned a PRM credit score within the range of 350 to 750. We generally expect that merchants to which we extend a working capital loan or advance will have PRM scores greater than 525. We generally consider scores above 610 to be very good and to pose less credit risk. For all outstanding working capital loans and advances, we assess a participating merchant’s PRM score on a recurring basis. At December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the weighted average PRM score related to our PayPal Working Capital balances outstanding was 619 and 625, respectively.The number of days our PayPal Working Capital loans and advances receivables are past due is based on the current expected repayment period of the loan or advance and fixed fee as compared to an original expected repayment period. We generally calculate the repayment rate of the merchant's estimated future payment volume such that repayment of the advance and fixed fee is expected to occur within 9 to 12 months from the date of the loan or advance. On a monthly basis, we recalculate the repayment period based on the repayment activity on the receivable. As such, actual repayment periods are dependent on actual payment processing volumes. We monitor receivables with repayment periods greater than the original expected repayment period. As of December 31, 2017, the total outstanding balance in our pool of Swift merchant loans, advances, interest and fees receivable was $309 million. We closely monitor credit quality for all merchant loans and advances, so that we can evaluate, quantify, and manage our credit risk exposure. To assess a merchant seeking a loan or an advance, we use, among other indicators, a risk model developed internally which utilizes information obtained from multiple data sources, both external and internal, to predict the likelihood of timely and satisfactory repayment by the merchant of the loan or advance amount and the related interest or fixed fee. Drivers of the model include elements sourced from a consumer credit bureau report, business credit bureau report, prior repayment history with our products where available, and other information obtained during the application process. We use delinquency status and trends to assist in making new and ongoing credit decisions, to adjust our internal model, plan our collection practices and strategies and in the end our determination of our allowance for these loans and advances.For Swift business loan and advance products, the determination of delinquency, from current to 180 days past due, is based on the current expected repayment period of the loan and fixed fee payment as compared to the original expected repayment period. The following table provides information regarding the credit quality of our merchant receivables: 44 Table of Contents December 31, 2017 2016PayPal Working Capital loans and advances Percentage of merchant receivables with PRM scores > 61064.0% 67.7%Percentage of merchant receivables with PRM scores < 52516.1% 12.9%Percent of merchant receivables within original expected repayment period83.8% 82.8%Percent of merchant receivables > 90 days outstanding after the end of original expected repayment period7.1% 7.5% Swift business loans and advances Percent of merchant receivables within original expected repayment period95.5% N/APercent of merchant receivables > 90 days outstanding after the end of original expected repayment period1.9% N/A Modifications to the acceptable risk parameters of our PayPal credit products for the periods presented did not have a material impact on our loans. For additional information, see \"Note 10—Loans and Interest Receivable\" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Customer support and operations Customer support and operations expenses include costs incurred to provide 24-hour call support to our customers, our site operations and other infrastructure costs incurred to support our Payments Platform, costs to support our trust and security programs protecting our merchants and consumers and other costs incurred related to the delivery of our products.Customer support and operations costs increased $97 million, or 8%, in 2017 compared to 2016 and increased $157 million, or 14%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in 2017 was due primarily to an increase in network infrastructure expenses and contractor and employee related expenses to support the growth in our active customer accounts and the number of payment transactions occurring on our Payments Platform. The increase in 2016 was due primarily to an increase in contractor and employee related expenses to service the growth in our active customer accounts and the number of payment transactions occurring on our Payments Platform. Sales and marketing Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of customer acquisition, business development, advertising, marketing programs, and employee compensation and contractor costs to support these programs. Sales and marketing expenses increased $159 million, or 16%, in 2017 compared to 2016 and increased $32 million, or 3%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in 2017 was due primarily to higher spend on external marketing campaigns and higher employee related expenses. The increase in 2016 was due primarily to higher marketing spend related to Xoom on advertising campaigns intended to enhance our global brand recognition. Product development Product development expenses consist primarily of employee compensation and contractor costs that are incurred in connection with the development of our Payments Platform, new products and the improvement of our existing products. Product development expenses exclude software and website development costs that are capitalized. The amortization of developed technology is included in depreciation and amortization expense.Product development expenses increased $119 million, or 14%, in 2017 compared to 2016 and increased $42 million, or 5%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in 2017 was due primarily to an increase in employee related expenses. The increase in 2016 was due primarily to an increase in employee related expenses, driven primarily by Xoom, offset by a decrease in contractor related expenses. 45 Table of Contents General and administrative General and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs incurred to provide support to our business, including legal, human resources, finance, risk and compliance, executive and other support operations. Our legal expenses, including those related to ongoing legal and regulatory proceedings, settlements, judgments and fines, may fluctuate substantially from period to period.For the period prior to the separation, our consolidated financial statements include expenses associated with workplace resources and information technology that were previously allocated to the Payments segment of eBay, and additional expenses related to certain corporate functions, including senior management, legal, human resources and finance. These expenses also include allocations related to stock-based compensation. The expenses incurred by eBay were allocated to us based on direct usage or benefit where identifiable, with the remainder allocated on a pro rata basis of revenue, headcount, or other systematic measure. The corporate costs and allocation of expenses from eBay may not be indicative of the expenses that may have been incurred had we been a separate stand-alone entity during the period presented, nor are the results stated herein indicative of the expenses we may incur in the future. Such expenses could be higher or lower. In the period presented prior to the separation, a significant portion of expenses associated with these functions and allocated to us in our consolidated financial statements are included in general and administrative expenses.General and administrative expenses increased $127 million, or 12%, in 2017 compared to 2016 and increased $155 million, or 18%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in 2017 was due primarily to an increase in employee related expenses and professional expenses, and continued investments in compliance programs. The increase in 2016 was due primarily to an increase in employee expenses, contractor related expenses incurred to operate as an independent public company, and continued investments in compliance programs. Depreciation and amortization The primary components of our depreciation and amortization expenses include the depreciation and amortization of software, including the amortization of capitalized software and website development costs, amortization of equipment used to deliver our services and the amortization of acquired intangible assets. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $81 million, or 11%, in 2017 compared to 2016, and increased $116 million, or 19%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The increases in 2017 and 2016 were due primarily to additional depreciation expenses associated with investments in our technology platform. Amortization expense for intangible assets was $126 million, $150 million and $93 million in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in amortization of acquired intangibles in 2017 was due primarily to lower amortization expense resulting from fully amortized assets. Additionally, the increase in depreciation and amortization in 2017 was partially attributable to an impairment charge of $30 million related to a portion of the acquired customer-related intangible assets. For additional information, see “Note 4—Goodwill and Intangible Assets” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The increase in amortization of intangibles in 2016 was due primarily to our acquisitions completed in 2015. Restructuring and other charges Restructuring and other charges consist of restructuring expenses and cost adjustments related to our loans and receivables, held for sale portfolio. Restructuring and other charges increased by $132 million in 2017 compared to 2016 due to restructuring charges of $40 million and cost adjustments of $92 million related to our loans and receivables, held for sale portfolio.In the first quarter of 2017, management approved a plan to implement a strategic reduction of the existing global workforce which was substantially completed by the end of 2017. We recognized $40 million of restructuring expenses during the year ended December 31, 2017. No restructuring expenses were recognized in 2016. In January 2015, at a regular meeting of eBay’s board of directors (the “eBay Board”), the eBay Board approved a plan to implement a strategic reduction of its existing global workforce. The reduction was completed by the end of 2015 primarily impacting sales and marketing and product development expenses. Restructuring expenses were $48 million in 2015. Subsequent to the designation as held for sale of the U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio in November 2017, approximately $92 million related to adjustments to the cost basis, which are primarily driven by charge offs against those loans and interest receivables, were recorded in restructuring and other charges during the year ended December 31, 2017. 46 Table of Contents Income Tax Expense On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act includes significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system including: a federal corporate rate reduction from 35% to 21%; limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation; creation of new minimum taxes such as the base erosion anti-abuse tax (“BEAT”) and Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (“GILTI”) tax; and the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a modified territorial tax system, which will result in a one time U.S. tax liability on those earnings which have not previously been repatriated to the U.S. (the “Transition Tax”).In connection with our initial analysis of the impact of the Tax Act, we have recorded a provisional estimate of discrete net tax expense of $180 million in the period ended December 31, 2017. This discrete expense consists of provisional estimates of $1,468 million net expense for the Transition Tax payable in installments over eight years, $1,295 million net benefit for the decrease in our deferred tax liability on unremitted foreign earnings, and $7 million net expense for remeasurement of our deferred tax assets/liabilities for the corporate rate reduction and changes in our valuation allowance.We have not completed our accounting for the income tax effects of certain elements of the Tax Act, including the new GILTI and BEAT taxes. Due to the complexity of these new tax rules, we are continuing to evaluate these provisions of the Tax Act and whether such taxes are recorded as a current-period expense when incurred or whether such amounts should be factored into a company’s measurement of its deferred taxes. As a result, we have not included an estimate of the tax expense/benefit related to these items for the period ended December 31, 2017.Our effective tax rate was 18% in 2017, 14% in 2016, and 17% in 2015. The increase in our effective tax rate in 2017 was primarily due to discrete net tax expense recorded for U.S. tax reform, partially offset by the adoption of the new stock-based compensation accounting standard in 2017. The decrease in our effective tax rate during 2016 compared to 2015 was due primarily to favorable discrete tax adjustments during the year ended December 31, 2016 and other separation-related costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2015. See “Note 17—Income Taxes” to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on our effective tax rate. Non-GAAP Financial Information Non-GAAP financial information is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s performance that excludes or includes amounts that create differences between the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation S-K, the following portion of this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” includes a reconciliation of certain non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP.We present non-GAAP financial measures to enhance an investor’s evaluation of our operating results and to facilitate meaningful comparisons of our results between periods. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to, among other things; evaluate our operations, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation.We exclude the following items from non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted share, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP effective tax rate: •Stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes. This consists of expenses for equity awards under our equity incentive plans. We exclude stock-based compensation expense from our non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses. The related employer payroll taxes are dependent on our stock price and the timing and size of exercises and vesting of equity awards, over which management has limited to no control, and as such management does not believe it correlates to the operation of our business.•Amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets, impairment of goodwill and transaction expenses from the acquisition or disposal of a business. We incur amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill in connection with acquisitions and may incur significant gains or losses or transactional expenses from the acquisition or disposal of a business and therefore exclude these amounts from our non-GAAP measures. We exclude these items because management does not believe they are reflective of our ongoing operating results.•Separation. These are significant expenses related to the separation of our business from eBay into a separate, independent publicly traded company. These consist primarily of third-party consulting fees, legal fees, employee retention payments and other expenses incurred to complete the separation. We exclude these items because management does not believe they are reflective of our ongoing operating results.•Restructuring. These consist of expenses for employee severance and other exit and disposal costs. We exclude restructuring charges primarily because management does not believe they are reflective of ongoing operating results.•Certain other significant gains, losses, benefits, or charges that are not indicative of our core operating results. These are significant gains, losses, benefits, or charges during a period that are the result of isolated events or transactions which have not occurred frequently in the past and are not expected to occur regularly in the future. We exclude these amounts from our non-GAAP results because management does not believe they are indicative of our ongoing operating results. •Tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments. This adjustment is made to present stock-based compensation and the other amounts described above on an after-tax basis consistent with the presentation of non-GAAP net income. The following table provides reconciliations of our consolidated non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015: 47 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 (In millions, except percentages)GAAP net revenues$13,094 $10,842 $9,248Other(1)(39) — —Non-GAAP net revenues$13,055 $10,842 $9,248 (1) Elimination of allowance on interest receivable due to the U.S. consumer credit portfolio designation as held for sale.

(2) On July 17, 2015, the distribution date, eBay stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 8, 2015 received one share of PayPal common stock for every share of eBay common stock held as of the record date. (3) The weighted average number of common shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2015 was based on the number of common shares distributed on July 17, 2015 for the period prior to distribution and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period beginning after the distribution date. In addition to the non-GAAP measures discussed above, we also use free cash flow to assess our performance. Free cash flow represents cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases of property and equipment, and including investments in our Payments Platform, which can then be used to, among other things, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions, and repurchase stock. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period.

The following table summarizes the cash, cash equivalents and investments as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016: Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 (In millions)Cash, cash equivalents and investments(1)(2)$7,487 $6,447(1) Excludes assets related to customer accounts of $18.2 billion and $14.4 billion at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.(2) Excludes total restricted cash of $81 million and $17 million at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, and cost method investments of $88 million and $50 million as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.Cash, cash equivalents and investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were $6.1 billion as of December 31, 2017 and $5.0 billion at December 31, 2016, or 81% and 78% of our total cash, cash equivalents and investments as of those respective dates. At December 31, 2017 all of our cash, cash equivalents and investments held by foreign subsidiaries were subject to U.S. taxation under the one-time transition tax as further discussed in “Note 17—Income Taxes” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Subsequent repatriations will not be taxable from a U.S. federal tax perspective, but may be subject to state or foreign withholding tax.In the fourth quarter of 2017, we entered into a credit agreement (\"2017 Credit Agreement\") that provides for an unsecured $3.0 billion, 364-day delayed-draw term loan credit facility, which is available in up to three borrowings. Borrowings and other amounts payable under the 2017 Credit Agreement are guaranteed by our PayPal, Inc. subsidiary. Subject to specified conditions, we may designate one or more of our subsidiaries as additional borrowers under the 2017 Credit Agreement provided that we and PayPal, Inc. guarantee all borrowings and other obligations of any such subsidiaries under the 2017 Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2017, no subsidiaries were designated as additional borrowers. Funds borrowed under the 2017 Credit Agreement may be used for capital allocation and other general corporate purposes of us and our subsidiaries.Loans under the 2017 Credit Agreement will bear interest at either (i) the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a margin (based on our public debt ratings) ranging from 1.00 percent to 1.25 percent or (ii) a formula based on the agent bank's prime rate, the NYFRB rate (the greater of the federal funds effective rate and the overnight bank funding rate) or LIBOR plus a margin (based on our public debt ratings) ranging from zero percent to 0.25 percent. The 2017 Credit Agreement will terminate and all amounts owing thereunder will be due and payable in December 2018, unless the commitments are terminated earlier, either at our request or, if an event of default occurs, by the lenders (or automatically in the case of certain bankruptcy-related events). Subject to certain exceptions, if we were to issue debt securities or enter into a credit facility, a corresponding portion of the aggregate commitments and outstanding loans under the 2017 Credit Agreement will be terminated and be required to be paid, as applicable. The 2017 Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants, events of default and indemnification provisions in favor of the lenders. The negative covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens, subject to certain exceptions. The financial covenants require us to meet a quarterly financial test with respect to a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio, based on our public debt ratings. As of December 31, 2017, $1.0 billion was outstanding under the 2017 Credit Agreement at an interest rate of 2.78% (one month LIBOR plus a margin of 1.125%). Accordingly, at December 31, 2017, $2.0 billion of borrowing capacity was available for the purposes permitted by the 2017 Credit Agreement, subject to customary conditions to borrowing.The company maintains uncommitted credit facilities in various regions throughout the world, aggregating to approximately $250 million. Interest rate terms for these facilities vary by region and reflect prevailing market rates for companies with strong credit ratings. As of December 31, 2017, no amounts were outstanding under these facilities, and therefore, approximately $250 million of borrowing capacity was available, subject to customary conditions to borrowing.In the third quarter of 2015, we entered into a credit agreement (“2015 Credit Agreement” and collectively with the 2017 Credit Agreement, the \"Credit Agreements\") that provides for an unsecured $2.0 billion, five-year revolving credit facility that includes a $150 million letter of credit sub-facility and a $150 million swingline sub-facility, with available borrowings under the revolving credit facility reduced by the amount of any letters of credit and swingline borrowings outstanding from time to time. Borrowings and other amounts payable under the 2015 Credit Agreement are guaranteed by our PayPal, Inc. subsidiary. We may also, subject to the agreement of the applicable lenders, increase the commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to $500 million. Subject to specified conditions, we may designate one or more of our subsidiaries as additional borrowers under the 2015 Credit Agreement provided that we and PayPal, Inc. guarantee all borrowings and other obligations of any such subsidiaries under the 2015 Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2017, no subsidiaries were designated as additional borrowers. Funds borrowed under the 2015 Credit Agreement may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes.Loans under the 2015 Credit Agreement will bear interest at either (i) LIBOR plus a margin (based on our public debt ratings) ranging from 1.00 percent to 1.625 percent or (ii) a formula based on the agent bank’s prime rate, the federal funds effective rate or LIBOR plus a margin (based on our public debt ratings) ranging from zero percent to 0.625 percent. Subject to certain conditions stated in the 2015 Credit Agreement, we and any of our subsidiaries designated as additional borrowers may borrow, prepay and re-borrow amounts under the revolving credit facility at any time during the term of the 2015 Credit Agreement. The 2015 Credit Agreement will terminate and all amounts owing thereunder will be due and payable on July 17, 2020, unless (a) the commitments are terminated earlier, either at our request or, if an event of default occurs, by the lenders (or automatically in the case of certain bankruptcy-related events), or (b) the maturity date is extended upon our request, subject to the agreement of the lenders. The 2015 Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants, events of default and indemnification provisions in favor of the banks. The negative covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens, subject to certain exceptions. The financial covenants require us to meet a quarterly financial test with respect to a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio, based on our public debt ratings. During the third quarter of 2017, we drew down $800 million under the 2015 Credit Agreement, which was repaid during the fourth quarter of 2017. As of December 31, 2017, no borrowings or letters of credit were outstanding under the 2015 Credit Agreement. Accordingly, at December 31, 2017, $2.0 billion of borrowing capacity was available for the purposes permitted by the 2015 Credit Agreement, subject to customary conditions to borrowing.We have a cash pooling arrangement with a financial institution for cash management purposes. The arrangement allows for cash withdrawals from the financial institution based upon our aggregate operating cash balances held within the financial institution (“Aggregate Cash Deposits”). The arrangement also allows us to withdraw amounts exceeding the Aggregate Cash Deposits up to an agreed-upon limit. The net balance of the withdrawals and the Aggregate Cash Deposits are used by the financial institution as a basis for calculating our net interest expense or income under these arrangements. As of December 31, 2017, we had a total of $3.3 billion in cash withdrawals offsetting our $3.3 billion in Aggregate Cash Deposits held within the financial institution under the cash pooling arrangement.Growth in the portfolio of loan receivables increases our liquidity needs and any failure to meet those liquidity needs could adversely affect our business. We continue to evaluate partnerships and third party sources of funding of our credit portfolio. In March 2016, as approved by management and our Luxembourg banking subsidiary's Supervisory Board and as permitted within regulations set forth by the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (the \"CSSF\"), we designated $800 million of European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary to be used to extend credit to our European customers. In the fourth quarter of 2017, an additional amount of $700 million of European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary was approved and designated to be used to extend credit to our U.S. consumers. These funds were classified as cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheet on the date of designation and represent approximately 30% of European customer balances potentially available for corporate use by us at December 31, 2017 as determined by applying financial regulations maintained by the CSSF. We may periodically seek to designate additional amounts of customer balances, if necessary, based on utilization of the approved funds and anticipated credit funding requirements. Our objective is to expand the availability of our credit products with capital from external sources, although there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving that goal. In November 2017, we reached an agreement to sell our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio to Synchrony Bank. Historically, this portfolio was reported as outstanding principal balances, net of any participation interest sold and pro-rata allowances including, unamortized deferred origination costs and estimated collectible interest and fees. Following the closing of this transaction, which is expected to occur in the third quarter of 2018, Synchrony Bank will become the exclusive issuer of the PayPal credit online consumer financing program in the U.S., and we will no longer hold an ownership interest in the receivables generated through the program (other than charged off receivables).As of December 31, 2017, we continue to be rated investment grade by Standard and Poor's Financial Services, LLC and Fitch Ratings, Inc. We expect that these credit rating agencies will continue to monitor our performance, including our capital structure and results of operations. Our goal is to be rated investment grade, but as circumstances change, there are factors that could result in our credit ratings being downgraded or put on a watch list for possible downgrading. If that were to occur, it could increase our borrowing rates, including the interest rate on loans under the Credit Agreements. The risk of losses from our customer protection programs are specific to individual customers, merchants and transactions, and may also be impacted by regional variations in, and changes or modifications to, the programs, including as a result of changes in regulatory requirements. For the periods presented in these consolidated financial statements included in this report, our transaction loss rates, calculated by dividing transaction loss by TPV, ranged between 0.18% and 0.19% of TPV. Historical trends may not be an indication of future results. In January 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program that provided for the repurchase of up to $2 billion of our common stock, with no expiration from the date of authorization. In April 2017, our Board of Directors authorized an additional stock repurchase program that provides for the repurchase of up to $5 billion of our common stock, with no expiration from the date of authorization. This program became effective upon completion of the January 2016 stock repurchase program. The stock repurchase programs are intended to offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and, subject to market conditions and other factors, may also be used to make opportunistic repurchases of our common stock to reduce outstanding share count. Any share repurchases under our stock repurchase programs may be made through open market transactions, block trades, privately negotiated transactions or other means at times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate and will be funded from our working capital or other financing alternatives. However, any stock repurchases are subject to market conditions and other uncertainties and we cannot predict if or when any stock repurchases will be made. Moreover, we may terminate our stock repurchase programs at any time without notice. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we repurchased approximately $1.0 billion of our common stock under our January 2016 and April 2017 stock repurchase programs. As of December 31, 2017, a total of approximately $5.0 billion remained available for future repurchases of our common stock under our April 2017 stock repurchase program. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we repurchased approximately $995 million of our common stock under our January 2016 stock repurchase program. As of December 31, 2016, a total of approximately $1.0 billion remained available for future repurchases of our common stock under our January 2016 stock repurchase program.Our liquidity, access to capital and borrowing costs could be adversely impacted by declines in our credit rating, our financial performance, and global credit market conditions, as well as a broad range of other factors. In addition, our liquidity, access to capital and borrowing costs could also be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition” and “Note 13—Commitments and Contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion of these and other risks facing our business.We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, cash expected to be generated from operations, and our expected access to capital markets, together with potential external funding through third party sources, will be sufficient to fund our operating activities, anticipated capital expenditures, and PayPal credit products for the foreseeable future. Depending on market conditions, we may from time to time issue debt, including in private or public offerings, to fund our operating activities, finance acquisitions, repurchase shares under our share repurchase program, or reduce our cost of capital. 50 Table of Contents 51 Table of Contents Cash Flows In March 2016, we designated $800 million of European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary to be used to extend credit to our European customers. In the fourth quarter of 2017, an additional amount of $700 million of European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary was approved and designated to be used to extend credit to our U.S. consumers. We have presented changes in funds receivable and customer accounts as cash flows from investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows based on the nature of the activity underlying our customer accounts which includes purchases of investments, maturities and sales of investments and changes in funds receivable and customer accounts. We have elected to conform the prior period statement of cash flows to the current period presentation to enhance transparency and provide comparability. See “Note 1—Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the effects of the changes on the presentation of our statement of cash flows to our previously reported consolidated statement of cash flows. 52 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 (In millions)Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities$2,531 $3,158 $2,546Investing activities(5,358) (4,999) (8,038)Financing activities4,084 2,038 4,728Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents36 — (44)Net increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$1,293 $197 $(808) Operating Activities Cash flows from operating activities includes net income adjusted for certain non-cash expenses, timing differences between expenses recognized for provision for transaction and loan losses and actual cash transaction losses incurred, and changes in other assets and liabilities. Significant non-cash expenses for the period include depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation. The cash impact from actual transaction losses incurred during a period is reflected as a negative impact to changes in other assets and liabilities in cash from operating activities. The expenses recognized during the period for provision for loan losses are estimates of probable incurred losses on our consumer and merchant credit products (excluding the U.S. consumer credit portfolio from and after November 2017). Actual charge-offs of receivables related to our consumer and merchant credit products (excluding the U.S. consumer credit portfolio from and after November 2017) have no impact on cash from operating activities.We generated cash from operating activities of $2.5 billion in 2017 due primarily to operating income of approximately $2.1 billion. Adjustments for non-cash expenses of depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation were approximately $1.5 billion during 2017. Adjustments for non-cash expenses related to the provision for transaction and loan losses were approximately $1.0 billion during 2017. The cash generated from operating activities was negatively impacted by adjustments for non-cash expenses related to deferred income taxes of approximately $1.3 billion during 2017. The cash generated from operating activities was negatively impacted by changes in working capital primarily related to loans and interest receivable held for sale, net of $1.3 billion due to changes in the presentation of originations and collections on loans within the U.S. consumer credit portfolio subsequent to its designation as held for sale in November 2017, which are now presented in operating activities instead of investing activities, offset by changes in other assets and liabilities of $634 million. Collections on the U.S. consumer credit portfolio for originations that occurred prior to November 2017 will continue to be reflected in investing activities.We generated cash from operating activities of $3.2 billion in 2016 due primarily to operating income of approximately $1.6 billion. Adjustments for non-cash expenses of depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation (including excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation) were approximately $1.1 billion during 2016. Adjustments for non-cash expenses related to the provision for transaction and loan losses were approximately $1.1 billion during 2016. The cash generated from operating activities was negatively impacted by changes in working capital primarily related to transaction loss allowance for cash losses, net. We generated cash from operating activities of $2.5 billion in 2015 due primarily to operating income of approximately $1.5 billion. Adjustments for non-cash expenses of depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation (including excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation) were approximately $928 million during 2015. Adjustments to non-cash expenses related to transaction and loan losses were approximately $809 million during 2015. The cash generated from operating activities was negatively impacted by changes in working capital primarily related to actual transaction losses paid during the period. Additional uses of cash impacting cash generated from operating activities include net cash outflows relating to settlement of eBay payables and receivables of approximately $96 million and increases in accounts receivable of approximately $22 million.Cash paid for income taxes in 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $117 million, $48 million and $216 million, respectively. Investing Activities Cash flows from investing activities includes purchases, maturities and sales of investments, cash paid for acquisitions, purchases and sales of property and equipment, changes in principal loans receivable, funds receivable and customer accounts. For periods prior to the distribution, it also includes notes payable and receivable from eBay.The net cash used in investing activities of $5.4 billion in 2017 was due primarily to purchases of investments of $19.4 billion, increase in funds receivable and customer accounts of $2.5 billion including the reclassification of $700 million of European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary as cash and cash equivalents, changes in principal loans receivable portfolio (net of collections) originated through our consumer and merchant credit products excluding originations and collections pertaining to the U.S. consumer credit portfolio from and after November 2017 which are now presented in operating activities, of $920 million, acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $323 million, and purchases of property and equipment of $667 million. These net cash outflows were offset by maturities and sales of investments of $18.5 billion. Collections on the U.S. consumer credit portfolio for originations that occurred prior to November 2017 will continue to be reflected in investing activities.The net cash used in investing activities of $5.0 billion in 2016 was due primarily to purchases of investments of $21.0 billion, increases in our loan receivable portfolio (net of collections) originated through our PayPal credit products of $1.5 billion, purchases of property and equipment of $669 million and net increases in funds receivable from customers and customer accounts of $176 million, including the reclassification of $800 million of European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary as cash and cash equivalents. These net cash outflows were offset by maturities and sales of investments of $18.4 billion. The net cash used in investing activities of $8.0 billion in 2015 was due primarily to purchases of investments of $21.6 billion, acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $1.2 billion, increases in our loan receivable portfolio (net of collections) originated through our PayPal credit products of $819 million, and purchases of property and equipment of $722 million. These net cash outflows were offset in part by maturities and sales of investments of $16.1 billion and net cash inflows relating to receivables from eBay of $575 million. 53 Table of Contents Financing Activities Cash flows from financing activities includes proceeds from issuance of common stock, purchases of treasury stock, tax withholdings related to net share settlements of equity awards, borrowings net of repayments under financing arrangements, funds payable and amounts due to customers, and excess tax benefits from stock based compensation (for periods prior to 2017). For periods prior to the distribution, it also includes contribution from eBay.The net cash provided by financing activities of $4.1 billion in 2017 was due primarily to increases in funds payable and amounts due to customers of $4.3 billion and borrowings of $1.0 billion, partially offset by repayment of a loan of $170 million assumed in connection with our acquisition of Swift Financial, the repurchase of $1.0 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs and tax withholdings related to net share settlement of equity awards of $166 million.The net cash provided by financing activities of $2.0 billion in 2016 was due primarily to increases in funds payable and amounts due to customers of $3.0 billion, offset in part by the repurchase of $995 million of our common stock under our stock repurchase program.The net cash provided by financing activities of $4.7 billion in 2015 was due primarily to a contribution of approximately $3.9 billion of cash from eBay and increases in funds payable and amounts due to customers of $1.6 billion, offset in part by repayments of borrowings from eBay of $862 million. Free Cash Flow We define free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. Free cash flow was $1.9 billion in 2017, a decrease of $625 million from 2016. The decrease in free cash flow during the period was primarily due to lower cash generated from operating activities of $627 million, which was impacted by the change in presentation from investing activities to operating activities of originations and collections on the U.S. consumer credit portfolio subsequent to its designation as held for sale in November 2017. Free cash flow generated during 2017 was used for repurchasing our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, funding our credit portfolio, acquisitions and general business purposes. Free cash flow was $2.5 billion in 2016, an increase of $665 million from 2015. The increase in free cash flow during the period was primarily due to higher cash generated from operating activities of $612 million and lower purchases of property and equipment of $53 million. Free cash flow generated during 2016 was used for funding our credit portfolio, repurchasing our common stock under our stock repurchase program, and general business purposes.Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. See “Non-GAAP Financial Information” for information on how we compute free cash flow and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. 54 Table of Contents Effect of Exchange Rates on Cash The positive effect of currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents during 2017 of $36 million was due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against certain foreign currencies, primarily the Euro. Currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on cash and cash equivalents in 2016. The negative effect of currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents during 2015 of $44 million was due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against certain foreign currencies, primarily the Euro. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Future Liquidity and Obligations As of December 31, 2017, approximately $26.4 billion of unused credit was available to PayPal Credit account holders compared to $28.8 billion of unused credit as of December 31, 2016. While this amount represents the total unused credit available, we have not experienced, and do not anticipate, that all of our PayPal Credit account holders will access their entire available credit at any given point in time. In addition, the individual lines of credit that make up this unused credit are subject to periodic review and termination by the chartered financial institution that is the issuer of our U.S. PayPal Credit consumer products based on, among other things, account usage and customer creditworthiness. When a consumer funds a purchase in the U.S. using a PayPal credit product issued by a chartered financial institution, the chartered financial institution extends credit to the consumer, funds the extension of credit at the point of sale and advances funds to the merchant. We subsequently purchase the receivables related to the consumer loans extended by the chartered financial institution and, as a result of such purchase, bear the risk of loss in the event of loan defaults. Although the chartered financial institution continues to own each customer account, we own the related receivable (excluding participation interests sold) and are responsible for all servicing functions related to the account. Upon the closing of the sale of our loans and interest receivables, held for sale, which is expected to occur in the third quarter of 2018, we will no longer purchase receivables related to the U.S. consumer loans extended by the chartered financial institution.We have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments for general operating purposes. Changes in our business needs, contractual cancellation provisions, fluctuating interest rates, and other factors may result in actual payments differing from the estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of these payments. The following table summarizes our obligations as of December 31, 2017 that are expected to impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods. We believe we will be able to fund these obligations through our existing cash and investment portfolio and cash expected to be generated from operations.

The amounts presented are consistent with contractual terms and are not expected to differ significantly from actual results under our existing leases, unless a substantial change in our headcount needs requires us to expand our occupied space or exit an office facility early.•Transition Tax represents the one-time mandatory tax on previously deferred foreign earnings under the Tax Act, as further discussed in “Note 17—Income Taxes” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As we are unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits, net, the table above does not include $383 million of such non-current liabilities included in deferred and other tax liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017. 55 Table of Contents Seasonality The Company does not experience meaningful seasonality with respect to net revenues. No individual quarter in 2017, 2016 or 2015 accounted for more than 30% of annual net revenue. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The application of U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect our reported financial condition. We have established detailed policies and control procedures to provide reasonable assurance that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period. The accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to our financial statements. An accounting estimate is considered critical if both (a) the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (b) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to our financial condition. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates with the Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors. Our significant accounting policies, including recent accounting pronouncements, are described in “Note 1—Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the consolidated annual financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.A quantitative sensitivity analysis is provided where that information is reasonably available, can be reliably estimated and provides material information to investors. The amounts used to assess sensitivity are included to allow users of this report to understand a general direction cause and effect of changes in the estimates and do not represent management’s predictions of variability. For all of these estimates, it should be noted that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted, and estimates require regular review and adjustment. Transaction and loan losses Transaction and loan losses include the expense associated with our customer protection programs, fraud, chargebacks, and credit losses associated with our loans receivable balances. Our transaction and loan losses fluctuate depending on many factors, including: total TPV, macroeconomic conditions, changes to our customer protection programs, the impact of regulatory changes, and the credit quality of loans receivable arising from transactions funded with our PayPal credit products, which include our PayPal Credit consumer product and merchant loans and advances consisting of PayPal Working Capital and Swift business loans and advances to merchant sellers.We establish allowances for estimated transaction losses arising from processing customer transactions, such as chargebacks for unauthorized credit card use and merchant-related chargebacks due to non-delivery of goods or services, ACH returns, buyer protection program claims, account takeovers, and account overdrafts. Additions to the allowance, in the form of provisions, are reflected in transaction and loan losses in our consolidated statements of income. The allowances are monitored regularly and are updated based on actual claims data reported by our claims processors and other actual data received. The allowances are based on known facts and circumstances, internal factors including experience with similar cases, historical trends involving loss payment patterns, and the mix of transaction and loss types.We also establish an allowance for loans receivable, which represents our estimate of probable incurred loan losses inherent in our consumer loans receivable and merchant loans and advances. Increases to the allowance for loans receivable are reflected as transaction and loan losses in our consolidated financial statements. This evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates and judgments. In connection with the pending sale of our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio to Synchrony Bank, and the designation of that portfolio as held for sale in November 2017, we released corresponding allowances against those loans and interest receivable balances. Such allowances on any newly originated U.S. consumer loan receivables from and after November 2017 will not be established. Adjustments to the cost basis of this portfolio, which are primarily driven by charge offs, are recorded in restructuring and other charges in our consolidated statement of income. For our consumer loan receivables not subject to the sale agreement with Synchrony Bank, consisting primarily of our international consumer receivables, the allowance is primarily based on forecasted principal balance delinquency rates (“roll rates”). Roll rates are the percentage of balances which we estimate will migrate from one stage of delinquency to the next based on our historical experience, as well as external factors such as estimated bankruptcies and levels of unemployment. Roll rates are applied to the principal amount of our international consumer receivables for each stage of delinquency, from current to 180 days past the payment due date, in order to estimate the principal loans which have incurred losses and are probable to be charged off. For merchant loans and advances receivable, that includes PayPal Working Capital and Swift business loan and advance products, the allowance is primarily based on principal balances, forecasted delinquency rates and recoveries through the use of a vintage-based loss forecasting model.The determination of delinquency, from current to 180 days past due, for principal balances related to merchant loans and advances is based on the current expected repayment period of the loan or advance and interest or fixed fee as compared to the original expected repayment period. For PayPal Working Capital product we calculate the repayment rate based on the merchant's expected future payment volume such that repayment of the advance and fixed fee is typically expected to occur within 9 to 12 months from the date of the loan or advance. On a regular basis, we recalculate the repayment period based on the actual repayment activity on the receivable. As such, actual repayment periods are dependent on actual payment processing volumes. The allowance for loss against the interest receivable is primarily determined by applying historical average customer account roll rates to the interest receivable balance in each stage of delinquency to project the value of accounts that have incurred losses and are probable to be charged off. The allowance for fees receivable is primarily based on fee balances, forecasted delinquency rates and recoveries through the use of a vintage-based loss forecasting model. Increases to the allowance for fees receivable is recognized as a reduction in deferred revenues included in other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet.We charge off consumer loan receivable balances in the month in which a customer balance becomes 180 days past the payment due date. We charge off the PayPal Working Capital receivable when the updated repayment period is 180 days past the original expected repayment period and the merchant has not made a payment in the last 60 days. We also charge off the receivable when the updated repayment period is 360 days past the original expected repayment period regardless of whether or not the merchant has made a payment within the last 60 days. Bankrupt accounts are charged off within 60 days of receiving notification of bankruptcy. Loans receivable past the payment due date continue to accrue interest until such time as they are charged off, with the portion of the reserve related to the interest receivable balance classified as a reduction of revenue for international consumers and recorded in restructuring and other charges for the U.S. consumer receivables, in our consolidated statement of income. For Swift business loan and advance products, we charge off the receivable when the repayments are 180 days past our expectation of repayments. Bankrupt accounts are charged off within 60 days of receiving notification of bankruptcy. The provision for loan losses is recognized in transaction and loan losses. Charge-offs that are recovered are recorded as a reduction to our allowance for loans and interest receivable. Determining appropriate allowances for these losses is an inherently uncertain process and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates. We regularly update our allowance estimates as new facts become known and events occur that may impact the settlement or recovery of losses. The allowances are maintained at a level we deem appropriate to adequately provide for losses incurred at the balance sheet date. Based on our results for the year ended December 31, 2017, an aggregate ten percent increase in our transaction and loan loss rate would negatively impact transaction and loan losses by approximately $101 million. 56 Table of Contents Accounting for Income Taxes Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective government taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. Our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rates that apply to our foreign earnings. In addition to local country tax laws and regulations, our income tax rate depends on the extent that our foreign earnings are taxed by the U.S. through new provisions under the Tax Act such as the new GILTI tax and BEAT or as a result of our indefinite reinvestment assertion. Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management’s judgment about and intentions concerning our future operations. Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates that are based on a number of factors, including our historical experience and short range and long-range business forecasts. To the extent deferred tax assets are not expected to be realized, we record a valuation allowance.We recognize and measure uncertain tax positions in accordance with GAAP, pursuant to which we only recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. GAAP further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings in the quarter in which such change occurs. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.We file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions around the world. A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited by the relevant tax authorities and finally resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our reserves for income taxes are adequate such that we reflect the benefits more likely than not to be sustained in an examination. We adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest, where appropriate in light of changing facts and circumstances. Settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash.Based on our results for the year ended December 31, 2017, a one-percentage point increase in our effective tax rate would have resulted in an increase in our income tax expense of approximately $22 million. 57 Table of Contents Loss Contingencies We are currently involved in various claims, legal proceedings and investigations of potential operating violations by regulatory oversight authorities. We regularly review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim, legal proceeding or potential regulatory violation is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims, litigation or other violation and may revise our estimates. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes. Revenue Recognition Application of the various accounting principles in U.S. GAAP related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires us to make judgments and estimates. Complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting. Specifically, the determination of whether we are a principal to a transaction (gross revenue) or an agent (net revenue) can require considerable judgment. Further, we provide incentive payments to consumers and merchants, which require judgment to determine whether the payments should be recorded as a reduction to gross revenue. Changes in judgments with respect to these assumptions and estimates could impact the amount of revenue recognized. Valuation of Goodwill and Intangibles The valuation of assets acquired in a business combination and asset impairment reviews require the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to estimate the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in an acquired business to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill. Impairment testing for assets, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, requires the allocation of cash flows to those assets or group of assets and if required, an estimate of fair value for the assets or group of assets. Our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. These valuations require the use of management’s assumptions, which would not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur.We evaluate goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or sooner if indicators of impairment exist. Under the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) guidance, the evaluation of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment allows for a qualitative assessment to be performed, which is similar to the FASB guidance for evaluating goodwill for impairment. In performing these qualitative assessments, we consider relevant events and conditions, including but not limited to: macroeconomic trends, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance, cost factors, company-specific events, legal and regulatory factors and our market capitalization. If the qualitative assessments indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than their carrying amounts, we must perform a quantitative impairment test.Under the quantitative impairment test, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset, an impairment loss is recorded in the statement of income. Measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit is based on one or more of the following fair value measures: amounts at which the unit as a whole could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties, using present value techniques of estimated future cash flows, or using valuation techniques based on multiples of earnings or revenue, or a similar performance measure. 58 Table of Contents 59 Table of Contents Market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity price risk. Management establishes and oversees the implementation of policies governing our investing, funding, and foreign currency derivative activities in order to mitigate market risks. We monitor risk exposures on an ongoing basis. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to interest rate risk relating to our investment portfolio and from interest-rate sensitive assets underlying the customer balances we hold on our consolidated balance sheet as customer accounts. We seek to reduce earnings volatility that may result from changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, approximately 39% and 25%, respectively, of our total cash and investment portfolio was held in cash and cash equivalents. The assets underlying the customer balances we hold on our consolidated balance sheet as customer accounts are maintained in interest and non-interest bearing bank deposits, time deposits, U.S. and foreign government and agency securities and corporate debt securities. We classify the assets underlying the customer balances as current based on their purpose and availability to fulfill our direct obligation under amounts due to customers. We seek to preserve principal while holding eligible liquid assets, as defined by applicable regulatory requirements and commercial law in the jurisdictions where we operate, equal to at least 100% of the aggregate amount of all customer balances. We do not pay interest on amounts due to customers.In the fourth quarter of 2017, we entered into an unsecured $3.0 billion, 364 day delayed-draw term loan credit facility, which is available in up to three borrowings (\"2017 Credit Agreement\"). In the third quarter of 2015, we entered into a $2.0 billion senior unsecured credit facility maturing in 2020 (\"2015 Credit Agreement\"). The company maintains uncommitted credit facilities in various regions throughout the world, aggregating to approximately $250 million. Borrowings under the 2017 Credit Agreement and 2015 Credit Agreement, if any, bear interest at floating rates. As a result, we will be exposed to fluctuations in interest rates to the extent of our borrowings. As of December 31, 2017, $1.0 billion was outstanding under the 2017 Credit Agreement at an interest rate of 2.78% (one month LIBOR plus a margin of 1.125%). Accordingly, at December 31, 2017, $2.0 billion of borrowing capacity was available for the purposes permitted by the 2017 Credit Agreement, subject to customary conditions to borrowing. As of December 31, 2017, no borrowings or letters of credit were outstanding under the 2015 Credit Agreement or uncommitted facilities.Interest rates may also adversely impact our customers’ spending levels and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amounts owed to us. Higher interest rates often lead to higher payment obligations by customers to us and other lenders under mortgage, credit card and other consumer and merchant loans, which may reduce our customers’ ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore lead to increased delinquencies, charge-offs and allowance for loan and interest receivable, which could have an adverse effect on our net income. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would not have had a material impact on our financial assets or liabilities at December 31, 2017 and 2016. Foreign Currency Risk We have significant operations internationally that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar, subjecting us to foreign currency risk which may adversely impact our financial results. We transact business in various foreign currencies and have significant international revenues and costs. In addition, we charge our international subsidiaries for their use of intellectual property and technology and for certain corporate services. Our cash flows, results of operations and certain of our intercompany balances that are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses due to foreign currency fluctuations and related hedging activities. We are generally a net receiver of foreign currencies and therefore benefit from a weakening of the U.S. dollar, and are adversely affected by a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, relative to foreign currencies.We have a foreign exchange exposure management program designed to identify material foreign currency exposures, manage these exposures and reduce the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated cash flows and results of operations through the execution of foreign currency exchange contracts. These foreign currency exchange contracts are accounted for as derivative instruments; for additional details related to our foreign currency exchange contracts, please see “Note 8—Derivative Instruments” to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We use foreign exchange forward contracts to protect our forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These hedging contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movements. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. The effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) and subsequently reclassified into revenue in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the unrealized gains and losses on these contracts, if any, is recorded immediately in earnings. We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that changes in exchange rates of 20% for all currencies could be experienced in the near term. If the U.S. dollar weakened by 20% at December 31, 2017 and 2016, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign currency exchange forward contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately $536 million and $341 million lower, respectively. If the U.S. dollar strengthened by 20% at December 31, 2017 and 2016, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign currency exchange forward contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately $536 million and $341 million higher, respectively.We have an additional foreign exchange management program whereby we use foreign currency exchange contracts to offset the foreign currency exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency gains and losses on our assets and liabilities are recorded in other income (expense), net, and are offset by the gains and losses on the foreign currency exchange contracts.Adverse changes in exchange rates of 20% for all currencies would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately $243 million and $160 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, without considering the offsetting effect of hedging. Foreign currency exchange contracts in place as of December 31, 2017 would have positively impacted income before income taxes by approximately $211 million, resulting in a net negative impact of approximately $32 million. Foreign currency exchange contracts in place as of December 31, 2016 would have positively impacted income before income taxes by approximately $128 million, resulting in a net negative impact of approximately $32 million. These reasonably possible adverse changes in currency exchange rates of 20% were applied to total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of our subsidiaries at the balance sheet dates to compute the adverse impact these changes would have had on our income before income taxes in the near term. 60 Table of Contents Equity Price Risk As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, our cost method investments totaled $88 million and $50 million, respectively, which represented approximately 1% of our total cash and investment portfolio and were primarily related to cost method investments in privately held companies. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we did not hold any marketable equity instruments. We review our investments for impairment when events and circumstances indicate a decline in fair value of such assets below carrying value is other-than-temporary. Our analysis includes a review of recent operating results and trends, recent sales and acquisitions of the securities in which we have invested and other publicly available data.",

    "context": "Overview PayPal Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in January 2015 and is a leading technology platform and digital payments company that enables digital and mobile payments on behalf of consumers and merchants worldwide. Our vision is to democratize financial services, as we believe that managing and moving money is a right for all people, not just the affluent. Our goal is to increase our relevance for consumers and merchants to manage and move their money anywhere in the world, anytime, on any platform and using any device. Our combined payment solutions, including our PayPal, PayPal Credit, Braintree, Venmo, Xoom, and Paydiant products, compose our proprietary Payments Platform. We operate a two-sided proprietary global technology platform that links our customers, both merchants and consumers, around the globe to facilitate the processing of payment transactions, allowing us to connect millions of merchants and consumers worldwide. We offer our customers the flexibility to use their account to both purchase and be paid for goods, as well as to transfer and withdraw funds. We enable consumers to more safely exchange funds with merchants using a variety of funding sources, which may include a bank account, a PayPal account balance, a PayPal Credit account, a credit and debit card or other stored value products such as coupons and gift cards. Our PayPal, Venmo and Xoom products also make it safer and simpler for friends and family to transfer funds to each other. We offer merchants an end-to-end payments solution that provides authorization and settlement capabilities, as well as instant access to funds. We help merchants connect with their customers and manage risk. We enable consumers to engage in cross-border shopping and merchants to extend their global reach while reducing the complexity and friction involved in enabling overseas and cross-border trade. We generate revenues by charging fees for providing transaction processing and other payment-related services, primarily based on the volume of activity processed through our Payments Platform. We generally do not charge consumers to fund or draw from their accounts; however, we generate revenue from consumers on fees charged to exchange currencies. We also earn revenue by providing value added services to consumers and merchants, such as our PayPal Credit and gateway services. Our gateway services include our Payflow Gateway services and Braintree Gateway service that enable merchants to accept payments online with credit or debit cards. Our gateway services provide the technology that links a merchant’s website to its processing network and merchant account. Strategy Our ability to grow revenue is affected by, among other things, consumer spending patterns, merchant and consumer adoption of digital payment methods other than cash, the expansion of multiple commerce channels, the growth of mobile devices and merchant applications on those devices, the growth of consumers globally with Internet and mobile access, the pace of transition from cash and checks to digital forms of payment, our share of the digital payments market, and our ability to innovate new methods of payment that merchants and consumers value. Our strategy to drive growth in our business includes the following:•Growing our core: through expanding our global capabilities, customer base and scale, increasing our customers use of our products and services by better addressing their everyday needs related to accessing, managing and moving money and expanding the adoption of our solutions by new merchants and consumers;•Expanding our value proposition for customers: by focusing on trust and simplicity, providing risk management and insights from our two-sided Payments Platform and being technology and platform agnostic; •Extending through strategic partnerships: by building new strategic partnerships to provide better experiences for our customers, such as offering greater choice and flexibility, to acquire new customers and reinforce our role in the ecosystem; and•Seeking new areas of growth: through new international markets around the world and focusing on innovation both in the digital and the physical world. 4 Table of Contents Key Performance Metrics We measure the relevance of our products to our customers, and therefore the success of our business, through active customer accounts, payment volume and payment transactions:Active Customer Accounts: An active customer account is a registered account that successfully sent or received at least one payment or payment reversal through our Payments Platform, excluding transactions processed through our gateway and Paydiant products, in the past 12 months. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 197 million active customer accounts across more than 200 markets. A market is a geographic area or political jurisdiction, such as a country, territory, or protectorate, in which we offer our services. A country, territory or protectorate is identified by a distinct set of laws and regulations. Total Payment Volume (“TPV”): TPV is the value of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed through our Payments Platform, excluding transactions processed through our gateway and Paydiant products. Number of Payment Transactions: Number of payment transactions is defined as the total number of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed through our Payments Platform, excluding transactions processed through our gateway and Paydiant products. 5 Table of Contents Our Strengths Our business is built on a strong foundation designed to differentiate us from our competitors and drive growth. We believe that our competitive strengths include the following:•Two-sided Platform - our platform connecting merchants and consumers enables PayPal to offer unique end-to-end product experiences while gaining valuable insights into customer behavior through our data. Our platform provides for simple digital and mobile transactions while being both brand and technology agnostic.•Scale - our global scale allows us to drive organic growth. As of December 31, 2016, we had 197 million active customer accounts which included 15 million active merchant accounts, and in 2016, we processed $354 billion of TPV in more than 200 markets around the world.•Brand - we have built a well-recognized and trusted brand. Our marketing efforts play an important role in building brand visibility, usage and overall preference among customers. •Risk Management - our risk management system and tokenization usage are designed to keep our customers safer and to process legitimate transactions around the world while minimizing illegal, high-risk, or fraudulent transactions.•Regulatory - we believe that our regulatory licenses, which give us the ability to operate in markets around the world, are a clear advantage and support business growth. Technology Our Payments Platform utilizes a combination of proprietary technologies and services as well as technologies and services provided by third parties to efficiently and securely facilitate transactions between millions of merchants and consumers worldwide across different channels, markets and networks. Our Payments Platform connects with financial institutions around the world and allows consumers to make purchases using a broad range of payment methods, regardless of where a merchant is located. Consumers who use our Payments Platform can engage in cross-border shopping by sending payments in more than 200 markets across the globe and in more than 100 currencies, withdraw funds to their bank accounts in 56 currencies and hold balances in their PayPal accounts in 25 currencies. A transaction on our Payments Platform can involve multiple participants in addition to us: a merchant, a consumer and the consumer’s funding source provider. The following diagram illustrates a typical payment transaction between a consumer and a merchant using our PayPal product on our Payments Platform: 6 Table of Contents We have developed intuitive user interfaces, customer tools on our Payments Platform, transaction processing, database and network applications that help our customers to utilize our suite of products and services. Our Payments Platform, open application programming interfaces, and developer tools are designed to enable developers to innovate with ease and to offer robust applications to a global ecosystem of merchants and consumers, while at the same time maintaining the security of our customers’ financial information. The technology infrastructure supporting our Payments Platform simplifies the storage and processing of large amounts of data, eases the deployment and operation of large-scale global products and services, and automates much of the administration of large-scale clusters of computers. Our technology infrastructure has been designed around industry-standard architectures to reduce downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences. Our Payments Platform incorporates multiple layers of protection, both for continuity and system redundancy purposes and to help address cyber-security challenges. We engage in multiple efforts to protect our technology infrastructure and Payments Platform against these challenges, including regularly testing our systems to address potential vulnerabilities. We strive to continually improve our technology infrastructure and Payments Platform to enhance the customer experience and to increase efficiency, scalability, and security. Consumer and Merchant Payment Solutions Our combined payment solution capabilities were built to offer our customers, both consumers and merchants, a broad range of products and services in the digital and mobile age, allowing our consumers to make seamless transactions across different markets and networks while enabling our merchants to safely and simply receive payments from their customers. We partner with our merchants to help grow and expand their businesses by improving sales conversion, providing global reach, offering alternative payment methods, reducing losses through proprietary protection programs, and leveraging data analytics. Online and mobile merchants can onboard quickly with PayPal and are not required to invest in new or specialized hardware. For our standard service, we do not charge merchants setup or recurring fees. We offer credit products to certain small and medium-sized merchants through our PayPal Working Capital (“PPWC”) product which, for a fee, allows them to borrow a certain percentage of their annual payment volume processed by PayPal. We believe that our PPWC product allows us to deepen our engagement with our small and medium-sized business merchants by providing them capital to grow their business that they may not otherwise have effective or efficient access to from banks or other lending providers.PayPal is a popular form of payment for mobile commerce, and our business has grown with the increased adoption of mobile devices. Our Braintree products strengthen our position in mobile payments and extend our coverage to a new class of retailers that offer their services primarily through mobile applications. Through a single Braintree integration, a merchant can begin accepting payments with credit or debit cards, PayPal, Android Pay, Apple Pay, digital currencies such as Bitcoin, or other payment solutions. We also offer gateway services including our Payflow Gateway services and Braintree Gateway service that enable merchants to accept payments online with credit or debit cards. Our gateway services provide the payment gateway technology that links a merchant’s website to its processing network and merchant account. We focus on providing affordable consumer products intended to democratize access to and movement of money. We offer our customers the flexibility to use their account to both purchase and be paid for goods, as well as transfer and withdraw funds. We enable consumers to more safely exchange funds with merchants using a variety of financial resources, which may include a bank account, a PayPal account balance, a PayPal Credit account, a credit or debit card or other stored value products such as coupons and gift cards. We generally do not charge consumers to fund or draw from their accounts; however, we generate revenue from consumers on fees charged to exchange currencies and on interest and fees from our PayPal Credit products. We offer our PayPal Credit product to consumers as a potential funding source at checkout. Once a consumer is approved for credit, PayPal Credit is made easily available as a funding source in their account. We believe that our consumer credit products allow us to increase engagement with both consumers and merchants on our two-sided network as well as differentiate ourselves from rival payment processors by helping merchants drive incremental sales through products like PayPal Credit. We are responsible for all servicing functions related to all of our credit products. In the U.S., all credit originated through our PayPal Credit and PPWC products is currently extended through third-party financial institutions with whom we partner, and from whom we purchase the related receivables. For our consumer credit products outside the U.S., we extend credit through our Luxembourg banking subsidiary. For our merchant credit products outside the U.S., we extend working capital advances in the U.K. through our Luxembourg banking subsidiary, and we extend working capital advances in Australia through an Australian subsidiary. We continue to evaluate partnerships and third-party sources of funding of our credit portfolio, including, but not limited to, commercial banks, securitization markets, private equity firms and sovereign wealth funds. We offer consumers person-to-person (“P2P”) payment solutions through our PayPal website and mobile application, Venmo and Xoom. Our Venmo app in the U.S. is a leading mobile application used to move money between friends and family with their mobile device. Xoom is an international money transfer service that enables our customers to send money to, pay bills for and send prepaid mobile phone reloads for family and friends around the world in a secure, fast and cost-effective way, using their mobile device or personal computers. P2P is a significant customer acquisition channel with network effects that help to establish relationships with potential PayPal users by allowing them to join our Payments Platform at the time of making or receiving payments, which drives organic customer-driven growth. 7 Table of Contents Protecting Merchants and Consumers Protecting merchants and consumers on our Payments Platform from financial and data loss is imperative to successfully competing in the payments industry and growing our business sustainably. The risk to merchants and consumers (and their payments partners) from fraudulent activities, such as account takeover, identity theft and counterparty malicious activities, is growing. We provide merchants and consumers with protection programs on most purchase transactions completed through our Payments Platform, except for transactions using our gateway and Paydiant products. We believe that these programs, which protect both merchants and consumers from financial and data loss primarily due to fraud and counterparty non-performance, are generally much broader than similar protections provided by other participants in the payments industry. Many payments providers do not offer merchant protection in general, and those that do so generally do not provide protection for online or card not present transactions. As a result, merchants may incur losses for chargebacks and other claims on certain transactions when using other payments providers that they would not incur if they used our payments services. We also provide consumer protection against losses on qualifying purchases and accept claims for 180 days post transaction in the markets that we serve. We believe that this protection is generally consistent with, or better than, that offered by other payments providers. We believe that as a result of these programs, consumers can be confident that they will only be required to pay if they receive the product in the condition as described, and merchants can be confident that they will receive payment for the product that they are delivering to the customer.Our ability to protect both consumers and merchants is based largely on our proprietary end-to-end payments platform, our ability to leverage the data we collect on both sides of the transactions, from buyers and sellers, or from senders and receivers of money, on our two-sided network. We believe mobile devices will play an important part in the future of commerce, including by creating the opportunities to make our ecosystem safer. For example, PayPal is able to use location data from mobile devices and growing protection for the mobile operating environment to reduce risk to merchants and consumers. Our ongoing investment in systems and processes designed to enhance the safety and security of our products reflects our goal of having PayPal recognized as one of the world’s most trusted payments brands. 8 Table of Contents Competition The global payments industry is highly competitive. We compete against a wide range of businesses, including banks, credit card providers, technology and ecommerce companies and traditional retailers, many of which are larger than we are, have a dominant and secure position, or offer other products and services to consumers and merchants which we do not offer. We compete against all forms of payments, including credit and debit cards; automated clearing house and bank transfers; other online payment services; mobile payments; and offline payment methods, including cash and check.We compete primarily on the basis of the following:•ability to attract, retain and engage both merchants and consumers with our two-sided platform;•ability to show that merchants may achieve incremental sales by offering our end-to-end services;•consumer confidence in safety and security of transactions on our Payments Platform, including the ability for consumers to use our products and services without sharing their financial information with the merchant or the party they are paying;•simplicity of our fee structure;•ability to develop products and services across multiple commerce channels, including mobile payments and payments at the retail point of sale;•trust in our dispute resolution and buyer and seller protection programs;•customer service;•brand recognition;•website, mobile platform and application onboarding, ease-of-use and accessibility;•the technology- and payment-agnostic nature of our Payments Platform;•system reliability and data security;•ease and quality of integration into third-party mobile applications and operating systems; and•quality of developer tools such as our application programming interfaces and software development kits.In addition to the discussion in this section, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” under the caption “Substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry may harm our business” for further discussion of the potential impact of competition on our business. Research and Development Total research and development expense was $834 million, $792 million and $747 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Intellectual Property The protection of our intellectual property, including our trademarks (particularly those covering the PayPal name), patents, copyrights, domain names, trade dress and trade secrets is important to the success of our business. We protect our intellectual property rights by relying on applicable laws and regulations in the U.S. and internationally, as well as a variety of administrative procedures. We also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights in products and services. We have routinely entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors and nondisclosure agreements with parties with whom we conduct business to control access to and limit disclosure of our proprietary information.We pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and internationally. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain aspects of our proprietary technology. We have registered our core brands as trademarks and domain names in the U.S. and a large number of other jurisdictions and have in place an active program to continue to secure trademarks and domain names that correspond to our brands in markets of interest.For additional information regarding some of the risks relating to our intellectual property, including costs of protecting our intellectual property, see the information in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” under the captions “We are subject to patent litigation” and “We may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or third parties may allege that we are infringing their intellectual property rights.” 9 Table of Contents Government Regulation We operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened regulatory focus on all aspects of the payments industry. That focus continues to become even more heightened as regulators on a global basis focus on such important issues as countering terrorist financing, anti-money laundering, privacy and consumer protection. Some of the laws and regulations to which we are subject were enacted recently and the laws and regulations applicable to us, including those enacted prior to the advent of digital and mobile payments, are continuing to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation. Non-compliance with laws and regulations, increased penalties and enforcement actions related to non-compliance, changes in laws and regulations or their interpretation, and the enactment of new laws and regulations applicable to us could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Therefore, we monitor these areas closely to design compliant solutions for our customers who depend on us.Government regulation impacts key aspects of our business. We are subject to regulations that affect the payments industry in the markets we operate.Payments Regulation. Various laws and regulations govern the payments industry in the U.S. and globally. In the U.S., PayPal, Inc. holds licenses to operate as a money transmitter (or its equivalent), which, among other things, subjects PayPal, Inc. to reporting requirements, bonding requirements, limitations on the investment of customer funds and inspection by state regulatory agencies. Outside the U.S., we provide localized versions of our service to customers through various foreign subsidiaries. The activities of those non-U.S. entities are, or may, be supervised by a financial regulatory authority in the jurisdictions in which they operate. Among other regulatory authorities, the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (the “CSSF”), the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Reserve Bank of India, and the Central Bank of Russia have asserted jurisdiction over some or all of our activities in country. This list is not exhaustive, as there are numerous other regulatory agencies that have or may assert jurisdiction over our activities. The laws and regulations applicable to the payments industry in any given jurisdiction are subject to interpretation and change.Banking Agency Supervision. We serve our customers in the European Union through PayPal (Europe) S.à.r.l. et Cie, SCA, a wholly-owned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a bank in Luxembourg by the CSSF. Consequently, we must comply with rules and regulations of the banking industry, including those related to capitalization, funds management, corporate governance, anti-money laundering, disclosure, reporting and inspection. We also are, or may be, subject to banking-related regulations in other countries now or in the future related to our role in the financial industry. In addition, based on our relationships with our partner financial institutions in the U.S., we are subject to indirect regulation and examination by these financial institutions’ regulators.Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) has significant authority to regulate consumer financial products in the United States, including consumer credit, deposit, payment, and similar products. As a large market participant of remittance transfers, the CFPB has direct supervisory authority over our business. The CFPB and other similar regulatory agencies in other jurisdictions may have broad consumer protection mandates that could result in the promulgation and interpretation of rules and regulations that may affect our business.Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing. PayPal is subject to anti-money laundering (“AML”) laws and regulations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, as well as laws designed to prevent the use of the financial systems to facilitate terrorist activities. We have implemented a comprehensive AML program designed to prevent our payment network from being used to facilitate money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit activities, or to do business in countries or with persons and entities included on designated country or person lists promulgated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls (“OFAC”) and equivalent authorities in other countries. Our AML compliance program, overseen by our compliance officer, is composed of policies, procedures and internal controls, and is designed to address these legal and regulatory requirements and assist in managing money laundering and terrorist financing risks.Interchange Fees. Interchange fees associated with four-party payments systems are being reviewed or challenged in various jurisdictions. For example, in the European Union, the Multilateral Interchange Fee (“MIF”) Regulation (which became effective in December 2015) caps credit and debit interchange fees for cards payments and provides for business rules to be complied with by any company dealing with card transactions, including PayPal. As a result, the fees that we collect in certain jurisdictions may become the subject of regulatory challenge.Data Protection and Information Security. Aspects of our operations or business are subject to privacy and data protection regulation in the United States, the European Union and elsewhere. For example, in the United States, we are subject to information safeguarding requirements under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act that require the maintenance of a written, comprehensive information security program and in Europe, the operations of our Luxembourg bank are subject to information safeguarding requirements under the Luxembourg Banking Act, among other laws. Regulatory authorities around the world are considering numerous legislative and regulatory proposals concerning privacy and data protection. In addition, the interpretation and application of these privacy and data protection laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in a state of flux.Anti-Corruption. PayPal is subject to applicable anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar anti-corruption laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates. Anti-corruption laws generally prohibit offering, promising, giving, or authorizing others to provide anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a government official or private party in order to influence official action or otherwise gain an unfair business advantage, such as to obtain or retain business. We have implemented policies, procedures, and internal controls that are designed to comply with these laws and regulations.Additional Regulatory Developments. Various regulatory agencies continue to examine a wide variety of issues, including virtual currencies, identity theft, account management guidelines, privacy, disclosure rules, security and marketing that may impact PayPal's business.For an additional discussion on governmental regulation affecting our business, please see the risk factors related to regulation of our payments business and regulation in the areas of consumer privacy, data use and/or security in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” under the caption “Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition” and “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 10 Table of Contents Seasonality The Company does not experience meaningful seasonality with respect to net revenues. No individual quarter in 2016, 2015 or 2014 accounted for more than 30% of annual net revenue. Financial Information About Segments We operate in one business segment and have one reportable segment. See “Note 11—Segment and Geographical Information” to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information including certain financial information about our operations in the U.S. and abroad. Additionally, please see the information in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” under the caption “Our international operations are subject to increased risks, which could harm our business,” which describes risks associated with our foreign operations. Employees As of December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 18,100 people globally, of whom approximately 10,180 were located in the U.S. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. Separation from eBay Inc. PayPal Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in January 2015 for the purpose of owning and operating eBay’s Payments business in connection with the separation and distribution described below. Prior to the contribution of this business to PayPal Holdings, Inc., which occurred prior to the distribution in July 2015, PayPal Holdings, Inc. had no operations. On July 17, 2015 (the “distribution date”), PayPal became an independent publicly traded company through the pro rata distribution by eBay of 100% of the outstanding common stock of PayPal to eBay stockholders (which we refer to as the “separation” or the “distribution”). Each eBay stockholder of record as of the close of business on July 8, 2015 received one share of PayPal common stock for every share of eBay common stock held on the record date. Approximately 1.2 billion shares of PayPal common stock were distributed on July 17, 2015 to eBay stockholders. PayPal’s common stock began “regular way” trading under the ticker symbol “PYPL” on The NASDAQ Stock Market on July 20, 2015. Prior to the separation, eBay transferred substantially all of the assets and liabilities and operations of eBay’s payments business to PayPal, which was completed in June 2015. 11 Table of Contents Available Information The address of our principal executive offices is PayPal Holdings, Inc., 2211 North First Street, San Jose, California 95131.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The following discussion is divided into three sections. The first section, which begins immediately following this paragraph, discusses some of the risks that may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The second section, captioned “Risks Related to the Separation and Our Operation as an Independent Publicly Traded Company,” discusses some of the risks relating to our separation into an independent publicly traded company. The third section, captioned “Risks Related to Our Common Stock,” discusses some of the risks relating to an investment in our Common Stock. You should carefully review all of these sections for important information regarding risks and uncertainties that affect us, in addition to the other information appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition Substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry may harm our business. The global payments industry is highly competitive, and we compete against a wide range of businesses, many of which are larger than we are, have a dominant and secure position, or offer other products and services to consumers and merchants which we do not offer. As online and offline commerce are increasingly converging, the pace of change, innovation and disruption is also increasing. The global payments industry is rapidly changing, highly innovative and increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny, which may negatively affect the competitive landscape. Many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Competition may also intensify as businesses against which we compete or merchants enter into business combinations and alliances, and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business. We compete against a wide range of businesses with varying roles in all forms of payments, including:•paper-based transactions (principally cash and checks);•providers of traditional payment methods, particularly credit and debit cards, and Automated Clearing House transactions (in particular, well-established banks);•payment networks which facilitate payments for credit card users;•providers of “digital wallets” which offer customers the ability to pay online and/or on mobile devices through a variety of payment methods, including with mobile applications, through contactless payments, and with a variety of payment cards;•providers of mobile payments solutions that use tokenized card data approaches and contactless payments (e.g., near field communication functionality or host card emulation functionality) to eliminate the need to swipe or insert a card or enter a personal identification number or password;•payment-card processors that offer their services to merchants, including for “card on file” payments where the merchant invites the consumer to select a payment method for their first transaction, and subsequently uses the same payment method for subsequent transactions;•providers of “person-to-person” payments that facilitate individuals sending money with an email address or mobile phone number;•merchants and merchant associations providing proprietary payment networks to facilitate payments within their own retail network;•money remitters;•providers of card readers for mobile devices and of other point-of-sale and multi-channel technologies; and•providers of virtual currencies and distributed ledger technologies.We often partner with many of these businesses and we consider the ability to continue establishing these partnerships as important to our business. Competition for relationships with these partners is very intense and there can be no assurance we will be able to continue to establish, grow or maintain these partner relationships.We also face competition and potential competition from:•services that provide online merchants the ability to offer their customers the option of paying for purchases from their bank account or paying on credit;•issuers of stored value targeted at online payments;•other global online payment-services providers;•other providers of online account-based payments;•payment services targeting users of social networks and online gaming, including those offering billing to the consumer’s mobile phone account;•mobile payment services between bank accounts;•payment services enabling banks to offer their online banking customers the ability to send and receive payments through their bank account;•ecommerce services that provide special offers linked to a specific payment provider; •services that help merchants accept and manage virtual currencies; and•electronic funds transfer services as a method of payment for both online and offline transactions, particularly in Germany and the Netherlands.Some of these competitors have greater customer bases, volume, scale, resources, and market share than we do, which may provide significant competitive advantages. Some of our competitors may also be subject to less burdensome licensing, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, and other regulatory requirements. They may devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of products and services, and they may offer lower prices or more effectively introduce their own innovative programs and services that adversely impact our growth.We compete primarily on the basis of the following:•ability to attract, retain and engage both merchants and consumers;•ability to show that merchants will achieve incremental sales by offering our PayPal services;•consumer confidence in safety and security of transactions on our Payments Platform, including the ability for consumers to use our PayPal products and services without sharing their financial information with the merchant or the party they are paying;•simplicity of our fee structure;•ability to develop services across multiple commerce channels, including mobile payments and payments at the retail point of sale;•trust in our dispute resolution and buyer and seller protection programs;•customer service;•brand recognition;•website, mobile platform and application onboarding, ease-of-use and accessibility;•the technology- and payment-agnostic nature of our Payments Platform;•system reliability and data security;•ease and quality of integration into third-party mobile applications and operating systems; and•quality of developer tools, such as our application programming interfaces and software development kits.If we are not able to differentiate our business from those of our competitors, drive value for our customers, or effectively align our resources with our goals and objectives, we may not be able to compete effectively against our competitors. Our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threats could materially and adversely harm our business. 12 Table of Contents 13 Table of Contents Substantially all of our net revenues each quarter come primarily from transactions involving payments during that quarter, which may result in significant fluctuations in our operating results that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as well as the trading price of our common stock. Substantially all of our net revenues each quarter come primarily from transactions involving payments during that quarter. As a result, our operating and financial results have varied on a quarterly basis during our limited operating history and may continue to fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including as a result of the risks set forth in this “Risk Factors” section. It is difficult for us to forecast the level or source of our revenues or earnings (loss) accurately. In view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful, and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance. Due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting revenues, it is also difficult to forecast expenses as a percentage of net revenues. Quarterly and annual expenses as a percentage of net revenues reflected in our financial statements may be significantly different from historical or projected rates. Our operating results in one or more future quarters may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. The trading price of our common stock could decline, perhaps substantially, as a result of the factors described in this paragraph. Global and regional economic conditions could harm our business. Our operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions. Adverse economic conditions and events have negatively impacted global and regional financial markets in the past, and uncertainty about global and regional economic events and conditions may result in consumers and businesses postponing spending in response to tighter credit, higher unemployment, financial market volatility, government austerity programs, negative financial news, declines in income or asset values, and other factors. These and other global and regional economic events and conditions could have a material adverse impact on demand for our products and services, including a reduction in the volume and size of transactions on our Payments Platform. In addition, any financial turmoil affecting the banking system or financial markets could cause additional consolidation of the financial services industry, significant financial service institution failures, new or incremental tightening in the credit markets, low liquidity, and extreme volatility or distress in the fixed income, credit, currency, and equity markets, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. If we cannot keep pace with rapid technological developments to provide new and innovative products and services, the use of our products and services and, consequently, our revenues could decline. Rapid, significant, and disruptive technological changes continue to impact the industries in which we operate, including developments in payment card tokenization, mobile, social commerce (i.e., ecommerce through social networks), authentication, virtual currencies, distributed ledger technologies, near field communication and other proximity payment devices, such as contactless payments. We cannot predict the effects of technological changes on our business. In addition to our own initiatives and innovations, we rely in part on third parties, including some of our competitors, for the development of and access to new technologies. We expect that new services and technologies applicable to the industries in which we operate will continue to emerge and may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies we currently use in our products and services. Developing and incorporating new technologies into our products and services may require substantial expenditures, take considerable time, and ultimately may not be successful. In addition, our ability to adopt new products and services and develop new technologies may be inhibited by industry-wide standards, payments networks, changes to laws and regulations, resistance to change from consumers or merchants, third-party intellectual property rights, or other factors. Our success will depend on our ability to develop and incorporate new technologies and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards; if we are unable to do so in a timely or cost-effective manner, our business could be harmed. Changes in how consumers fund their PayPal transactions could harm our business. We pay significant transaction fees when consumers fund payment transactions using credit cards, lower fees when consumers fund payments with debit cards, nominal fees when consumers fund payment transactions by electronic transfer of funds from bank accounts, and nominal fees when consumers fund payment transactions from an existing PayPal account balance or through our PayPal Credit products. Our financial success is sensitive to changes in the rate at which our consumers fund payments using credit and debit cards (collectively, “payment cards”), which can significantly increase our costs. While we provide consumers with the opportunity to use their existing PayPal account balance to fund payment transactions, some of our consumers may prefer to use payment cards, especially if these payment cards offer functionality and benefits not associated with the use of their bank accounts. Some of our offerings, including the ability of consumers to make a limited number of “guest” payments without opening a PayPal account, have a higher rate of payment card funding than our basic product offering. An increase in the portion of our payment volume funded using payment cards or in fees associated with our funding mix, or other events or developments that make it more difficult or costly for us to fund transactions by electronic transfer of funds from bank accounts or existing PayPal account balances, could materially and adversely affect our financial performance and significantly harm our business. Some of our plans to lower our funding costs, including our PayPal Credit products and enabling consumers to defer payment for a short period of time on some transactions, may increase the risk to us of nonpayment by consumers.Negotiated arrangements with payment card networks and/or issuing banks, promoting greater choice and options for consumers to fund payment transactions could have an uncertain impact on our business. We have entered into a strategic partnership with partners such as Visa U.S.A. Inc. (“Visa”), MasterCard International Incorporated (“MasterCard”) and DFS Services LLC (“Discover”) to make it easier for merchants to accept and consumers to pay with these partners’ credit and/or debt cards and allow us to gain access to these partners tokenization services for in-store point of sale PayPal transactions. While we anticipate these and similar strategic partnerships we may enter in the future will result in an increase in the number of transactions and transaction volume that we process, we also anticipate that a greater percentage of customer transactions will be executed using a credit or debit card, which would likely increase our funding costs. If our transaction volume does not increase as expected, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected due to increased costs associated with our funding mix. 14 Table of Contents Our business is subject to cyberattacks and security and privacy breaches. Our business involves the collection, storage, processing and transmission of customers’ personal data, including financial information. In addition, a significant number of our customers authorize us to bill their payment card or bank accounts directly for all transaction and other fees charged by us. We have built our reputation on the premise that our Payments Platform offers customers a secure way to make payments. An increasing number of organizations, including large merchants and businesses, other large technology companies, financial institutions, and government institutions, have disclosed breaches of their information security systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks, including on portions of their websites or infrastructure.The techniques used to obtain unauthorized, improper or illegal access to our systems, our data or customers' data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems are constantly evolving, may be difficult to detect quickly, and often are not recognized until launched against a target. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means, including, among others, hacking into our systems or facilities or those of our customers, partners or vendors, or attempting to fraudulently induce our employees, customers, partners, vendors or other users of our systems into disclosing user names, passwords, payment card information, or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems. Certain efforts may be state-sponsored and supported by significant financial and technological resources, making them even more sophisticated and difficult to detect. We believe that PayPal is a particularly attractive target for such breaches and attacks due to our name and brand recognition and the widespread adoption and use of our products and services. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and customer data and to prevent data loss and other security breaches, and expect to continue to expend significant additional resources to bolster these protections, these security measures cannot provide absolute security. Our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyberattacks or security breaches, and third parties may be able to access our customers’ personal or proprietary information and payment card data that are stored on or accessible through those systems. Our security measures may also be breached due to human error, malfeasance, system errors or vulnerabilities, or other irregularities. Any actual or perceived breach of our security could interrupt our operations, result in our systems or services being unavailable, result in improper disclosure of data, materially harm our reputation and brands, result in significant legal and financial exposure, lead to loss of customer confidence in, or decreased use of, our products and services, and adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, any breaches of network or data security at our customers, partners or vendors (including data center and cloud computing providers) could have similar negative effects. Actual or perceived vulnerabilities or data breaches may lead to claims against us.In addition, under payment card rules and our contracts with our card processors, if there is a breach of payment card information that we store, or that is stored by our direct payment card processing customers, we could be liable to the payment card issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses. We also expect to expend significant additional resources to protect against security or privacy breaches, and may be required to redress problems caused by breaches. Among other reasons, financial services regulators in various jurisdictions, including the U.S. and the European Union (“EU”), have implemented or are considering proposals to impose new authentication requirements on banks and payment processors intended to reduce online fraud, which could impose significant costs, require us to change our business practices, make it more difficult for new customers to join PayPal, and reduce the ease of use of our products, which could harm our business. Additionally, while we maintain insurance policies, they may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches, and we may not be able to collect fully, if at all, under these insurance policies. 15 Table of Contents Systems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our websites, applications, products or services could harm our business. Our systems and those of our services providers and partners may experience service interruptions or degradation because of hardware and software defects or malfunctions, computer denial-of-service and other cyberattacks, human error, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, natural disasters, power losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist attacks, computer viruses or other malware, or other events. Our systems also may be subject to break-ins, sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. In addition, as a provider of payments solutions, we are subject to heightened scrutiny by regulators that may require specific business continuity, resiliency and disaster recovery plans and more rigorous testing of such plans, which may be costly and time-consuming and may divert our resources from other business priorities.We have experienced and expect to continue to experience system failures, denial of service attacks and other events or conditions from time to time that interrupt the availability or reduce or affect the speed or functionality of our products and services. These events have resulted and likely will result in loss of revenue. A prolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in the availability, speed or other functionality of our products and services could materially harm our business. Frequent or persistent interruptions in our services could cause current or potential customers to believe that our systems are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid our products and services, and could permanently harm our reputation and brands. Moreover, to the extent that any system failure or similar event results in damages to our customers or their business partners, these customers or partners could seek significant compensation or contractual penalties from us for their losses and those claims, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and costly for us to address, and could have other consequences described in this “Risk Factors” section under the caption “Our business is subject to cyberattacks and security and privacy breaches.”Our Payments Platform has experienced significant intermittent unavailability. Reliability is particularly critical for us because the full-time availability of our products and services is critical to our goal of gaining widespread acceptance among consumers and merchants for digital payments. We have undertaken certain system upgrades and re-platforming efforts designed to improve our reliability and speed. These efforts are costly and time-consuming, involve significant technical risk and may divert our resources from new features and products, and there can be no guarantee that these efforts will succeed. Because we are a regulated financial institution in certain jurisdictions, frequent or persistent site interruptions could lead to regulatory scrutiny, significant fines and penalties, and mandatory and costly changes to our business practices, and ultimately could cause us to lose existing licenses that we need to operate or prevent or delay us from obtaining additional licenses that we need to expand our business.We also rely on facilities, components and services supplied by third parties, including data center facilities and cloud storage services. If these third parties cease to provide the facilities, components or services, experience operational interference or disruptions, breach their agreements with us, or fail to meet our expectations, our operations could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected, which could result in customer dissatisfaction, damage to our reputation and brands, and materially and adversely affect our business. We do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for all losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of systems failures and similar events. Changes to payment card networks or bank fees, rules, or practices could harm our business. We do not directly access the payment card networks, such as Visa and MasterCard, that enable our acceptance of credit cards and debit cards, including some types of prepaid cards. Accordingly, we must rely on banks or other payment processors to process transactions and must pay fees for the services. From time to time, payment card networks have increased, and may increase in the future, the interchange fees and assessments that they charge for each transaction which accesses their networks. Payment card networks have or may impose special assessments for transactions that are executed through a “digital wallet” such as PayPal’s, and such fees could particularly impact us and significantly increase our costs. Our payment card processors may have the right to pass any increases in interchange fees and assessments on to us as well as increase their own fees for processing. Any changes in interchange fees and assessments could increase our operating costs and reduce our operating income. We have entered into strategic partnerships with Visa and MasterCard to further expand our relationships with these networks in a way that will make it easier for merchants to accept and consumers to choose to pay with Visa and MasterCard credit and debit cards. During the term of the agreements, Visa and MasterCard have each agreed to not enact or impose any fees or rules solely targeted at PayPal. Upon termination of the agreements, PayPal could become subject to special digital wallet fees or other special assessments.In addition, in some jurisdictions, governments have required Visa and MasterCard to reduce interchange fees, or have opened investigations as to whether Visa’s or MasterCard’s interchange fees and practices violate antitrust law. In the U.S., the Federal Reserve Board issued a final rule capping debit card interchange fees at significantly lower rates than Visa or MasterCard previously charged. In the EU, the Multilateral Interchange Fee Regulation limits credit and debit interchange fees for payments and imposes business rules on card processing services. Any material change in credit or debit card interchange rates in the U.S. or other markets, including as a result of changes in interchange fee limitations, could adversely affect our competitive position against traditional credit and debit card service providers. Future changes to those regulations could potentially have an adverse effect on our business.We are required by our processors to comply with payment card network operating rules, including special operating rules for payment service providers to merchants, and we have agreed to reimburse our processors for any fines they are assessed by payment card networks as a result of any rule violations by us or our merchants. The payment card networks set and interpret the card operating rules. From time to time, the networks have alleged that various aspects of our business model violate these operating rules. If such allegations are not resolved favorably, they may result in material fines and penalties or require changes in our business practices that may be costly. The payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or re-interpret existing rules that we or our processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow, or costly to implement. As a result, we could lose our ability to give consumers the option of using payment cards to fund their payments or the choice of currency in which they would like their payment card to be charged. If we are unable to accept payment cards or are meaningfully limited in our ability to do so, our business would be adversely affected.We and our payment card processors have implemented specific business processes for merchants to comply with payment card network operating rules for providing services to merchants. Any failure to comply with these rules could result in fines. We are also subject to fines from payment card networks if we fail to detect that merchants are engaging in activities that are illegal or that are considered “high risk,” primarily the sale of certain types of digital content. For “high risk” merchants, we must either prevent such merchants from using our PayPal services or register such merchants with the payment card networks and conduct additional monitoring with respect to such merchants. Although the amount of these fines has not been material to date, additional fines in the future could become material and could result in a termination of our ability to accept payment cards or require changes in our process for registering new customers, which would materially harm our business. Payment card network rules may also increase the cost of, impose restrictions on, or otherwise negatively impact the development of, our retail point-of-sale solutions, which may negatively impact their deployment and adoption. 16 Table of Contents Failure to deal effectively with fraud, fictitious transactions, bad transactions, and negative customer experiences would increase our loss rate and harm our business, and could severely diminish merchant and consumer confidence in and use of our services. We incur substantial losses due to claims from consumers that merchants have not performed or that their goods or services do not match the merchant’s description. We seek to recover such losses from the merchant, but may not be able to recover in full if the merchant is unwilling or unable to pay. In addition, in the event of the bankruptcy or other business interruption of a merchant that sells goods or services in advance of the date of their delivery or use (e.g., airline, cruise or concert tickets, custom-made goods and subscriptions), we could be liable to the buyers of such goods or services, either through our buyer protection program or through chargebacks on payment cards used by customers to fund their payment. While we have established reserves based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventualities, these reserves may be insufficient.We also incur substantial losses from claims that the consumer did not authorize the purchase, from consumer fraud, from erroneous transmissions and from customers who have closed bank accounts or have insufficient funds in them to satisfy payments. In addition, if losses incurred by us related to payment card transactions become excessive, they could potentially result in our losing the right to accept payment cards for payment, which would harm our business. We have taken measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud, but these measures need to be continually improved and may not be effective against new and continually evolving forms of fraud or in connection with new product offerings. If these measures do not succeed, our business could be harmed. We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We have significant operations internationally that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar, subjecting us to foreign currency risk. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar versus the British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar, and Canadian Dollar impacts the translation of our net revenues generated in these foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar. Additionally, in connection with providing our services in multiple currencies, we generally set our foreign exchange rates twice per day. We may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the times that we set them. Given that we also hold some corporate and customer funds in non-U.S. currencies, our financial results are affected by the translation of these non-U.S. currencies into U.S. dollars. We also have foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. While we regularly enter into transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency translation and balance sheet exposure, it is impossible to predict or eliminate the effects of this exposure. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could significantly impact our financial results. 17 Table of Contents Any factors that reduce cross-border trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business. Cross-border trade (i.e., transactions where the merchant or consumer are in different countries) is an important source of our revenue and profits. Cross-border transactions generally provide higher revenues and operating income than similar transactions that take place within a single country or market. Cross-border trade also represents our primary (and in some cases, our only) presence in certain important markets.Cross-border trade is subject to, and may be impacted by, foreign exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, the potential interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions (e.g., the jurisdiction of the merchant and of the consumer) are often extremely complicated in the context of cross-border trade. Changes to or the interpretation and/or application of laws applicable to cross-border trade could impose additional requirements (which may impose conflicting obligations) and restrictions on cross-border trade and increase the costs associated with cross-border trade. Any factors that increase the costs of cross-border trade or restrict, delay, or make cross-border trade more difficult or impractical would lower our revenues and profits and could harm our business. The United Kingdom’s departure from the EU could adversely affect us. The United Kingdom (“U.K.”) held a referendum on June 23, 2016 in which a majority of voters approved an exit from the EU (“Brexit”). Negotiations are expected to commence to determine the future terms of the U.K.’s relationship with the EU, including, among other things, the terms of trade between the U.K. and the EU. The effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the U.K. reaches to retain access to EU markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. The outcome of this referendum caused volatility in global stock markets and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and uncertainty about the terms and impact of Brexit may continue to do so in the future. Brexit could adversely affect U.K., regional (including European) and worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the British Pound and Euro, which in turn could adversely affect our customers and companies with which we do business, particularly in the U.K. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. In particular, depending on the terms of Brexit, we may face new regulatory costs and challenges, including the following:•we could lose our ability for our EU operations to passport into the U.K. market through the banking license of PayPal (Europe) S.à r.l. et Cie, SCA (“PayPal (Europe)”), our wholly-owned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a bank in Luxembourg, and our corresponding ability to work with Luxembourg regulators as the lead authority for various aspects of our U.K. operations;•we could be required to obtain additional regulatory licensing to operate in the U.K. market, adding costs and potential inconsistency to our business; and•we could also be required to comply with regulatory requirements in the U.K. that are in addition to, or inconsistent with, the regulatory requirements of the EU.Any of these effects of Brexit and others we cannot anticipate could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight, as well as extensive, complex, overlapping and frequently changing rules, regulations and legal interpretations. Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight. For a discussion of how government regulation impacts key aspects of our business, please see “Item 1. Business—Government Regulation” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our business is also subject to laws, rules, regulations, policies and legal interpretations in the markets in which we operate, including, but not limited to, those governing banking, credit, deposit taking, cross-border and domestic money transmission, foreign exchange, privacy, data protection, banking secrecy, payment services (including payment processing and settlement services), consumer protection, economic and trade sanctions, anti-money laundering, and counter-terrorist financing. The legal and regulatory requirements applicable to us are extensive, complex, frequently changing, and increasing in number, and may impose overlapping and/or conflicting requirements or obligations.Financial and political events have increased the level of regulatory scrutiny on the payments industry, and regulatory agencies may view matters or interpret laws and regulations differently than they have in the past and in a manner adverse to our business. Our success and increased visibility may result in increased regulatory oversight and tighter enforcement of rules and regulations that may apply to our business.As we expand and localize our international activities, we are increasingly becoming obligated to comply with the laws of the countries or markets in which we operate. In addition, because our services are accessible worldwide and we facilitate sales of goods and provide services to customers worldwide, one or more jurisdictions may claim that we or our customers are required to comply with their laws. Laws regulating the Internet, mobile and related technologies outside of the U.S. often impose different, more specific, or even conflicting obligations on us, as well as broader liability. For example, certain transactions that may be permissible in a local jurisdiction may be prohibited by regulations of U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) or U.S. anti-money laundering or counter-terrorist financing regulations.Any failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or new laws and regulations (including changes to or expansion of the interpretation of those laws and regulations), including those discussed in this risk factor, may subject us to significant fines, penalties, criminal and civil lawsuits, forfeiture of significant assets, and other enforcement actions in one or more jurisdictions; result in additional compliance and licensure requirements; increase regulatory scrutiny of our business; restrict our operations; force us to change our business practices, make product or operational changes or delay planned product launches or improvements. The foregoing could, individually or in the aggregate, expose us to significant liability, impose significant costs, require us to expend substantial resources, increase the cost and complexity of compliance, damage our brands and business, make our products and services less attractive, result in the loss of customers, limit our ability to grow the business, adversely affect our results of operations, and harm our reputation. The complexity of U.S. federal and state regulatory and enforcement regimes, coupled with the global scope of our operations and the evolving global regulatory environment, could result in a single event giving rise to a large number of overlapping investigations and legal and regulatory proceedings by multiple government authorities in different jurisdictions. We have implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws, and regulations, but there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations. 18 Table of Contents Payments Regulation In the U.S., PayPal, Inc. has obtained licenses to operate as a money transmitter (or its equivalent) in the states where it is required, as well as in the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. These licenses include not only the PayPal branded products and services in these states, but also our Venmo and Xoom branded products and services. As a licensed money transmitter, PayPal is subject to restrictions with respect to the investment of customer funds, reporting requirements, bonding requirements and inspection by state regulatory agencies. Accordingly, if we violate these laws or regulations, we could be subject to liability and/or additional restrictions, forced to cease doing business with residents of certain states, forced to change our business practices or be required to obtain additional licenses or regulatory approvals that could impose substantial costs.While we currently allow our customers with credit cards to send payments from approximately 200 markets, we allow customers in only approximately half of those markets (including the U.S.) to also receive payments, in some cases with significant restrictions on the manner in which customers can withdraw funds. These limitations may affect our ability to grow our business in these markets. Of the markets whose residents can use our PayPal services, almost 30 of them are in member states of the EU. We provide our services to customers in the EU through PayPal (Europe), our wholly-owned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a bank in Luxembourg. Accordingly, PayPal (Europe) is subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if it violates the disclosure, reporting, anti-money-laundering, capitalization, fund management, corporate governance, privacy, data protection, information security, banking secrecy, taxation, sanctions, or other requirements imposed on Luxembourg banks. In addition, EU laws and regulations are typically subject to different and potentially inconsistent interpretations by the countries that are members of the EU, which can make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage. Moreover, the countries that are members of the EU may each have different and potentially inconsistent interpretations of regulations implementing the EU Payment Services Directive and the E-Money Directive, which could make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage. The Revised Payment Services Directive (“PSD2”) entered into force in January 2016 and will need to be implemented into national legislation by January 2018. The implementation of the PSD2 may negatively affect our business. Finally, if PayPal (Europe) exceed certain thresholds, or if the European Central Bank (“ECB”) determines that PayPal (Europe) is a significant supervised entity or that some activity of PayPal (Europe) is subject to oversight by the ECB, PayPal (Europe) or certain of its activities could become directly regulated by the ECB in addition to the Luxembourg regulator, the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier, as its national supervisor, which could subject us to additional requirements and would likely increase compliance costs.In Australia, we serve our customers through PayPal Australia Pty. Ltd. (“PayPal Australia”), which is licensed by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission as a provider of a non-cash payment product and by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority as a purchased payment facility provider, which is a type of authorized depository institution. Accordingly, PayPal Australia is subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if it violates the product disclosure, reporting, anti-money laundering, capital requirements, privacy, corporate governance or other requirements imposed on Australian depository institutions.In many of the other markets in which we do business, we serve our customers through PayPal Pte. Ltd., our wholly-owned subsidiary that is based in Singapore. PayPal Pte. Ltd. is supervised by the Monetary Authority of Singapore and is designated as a holder of a stored value facility and does not hold a remittance license. As a result, PayPal Pte. Ltd. is not able to offer outbound remittance payments (including donations to charities) from Singapore, and can only offer payments for the purchase of goods and services in Singapore. In many of the markets (other than Singapore) served by PayPal Pte. Ltd., it is unclear and uncertain whether our Singapore-based service is subject only to Singapore law or, if it is subject to the application of local laws, whether such local laws would require a payment processor like us to be licensed as a payments service, bank, financial institution or otherwise.We are also subject to regulation in other markets in which we do business and we have been and expect to continue to be required to apply for various licenses, certifications and regulatory approvals in a number of the countries where we provide our services. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such licenses, certifications, and approvals. Even if we were able to obtain such licenses, certifications, and approvals, there are substantial costs and potential product changes involved in maintaining such licenses, certifications, and approvals, and we could be subject to fines or other enforcement action if we are found to violate disclosure, reporting, anti-money laundering, capitalization, corporate governance or other requirements of such licenses. These factors could impose substantial additional costs and involve considerable delay to the development or provision of our products or services, or could require significant and costly operational changes or prevent us from providing any products or services in a given market.In many other countries it may not be clear whether we are required to be licensed as a payment services provider, bank, financial institution or otherwise. In such markets, we may rely on local banks to process payments and conduct foreign exchange transactions in local currency. Local regulators may use their power to slow or halt payments to local merchants conducted through local banks or otherwise prohibit us from doing business in a country. Such regulatory actions or the need to obtain licenses, certifications or other regulatory approvals could impose substantial costs, involve considerable delay to the provision or development of our services, require significant and costly operational changes, impose restrictions, limitations, or additional requirements on our business, or prevent us from providing any products or services in a given market. For example, in June 2016, we suspended our operations in Turkey following cease and desist instructions from Turkey’s regulatory body, Bankacýlýk Düzenleme Ve Denetleme Kurumu (“BDDK”), following the BDDK’s rejection of our application for an e-money payments license. 19 Table of Contents Consumer Protection The financial services sector is subject to significant regulation and we are subject to consumer protection laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. In the U.S., we are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations applicable to our activities, including the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (“EFTA”) and Regulation E as implemented by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). Under such regulations we are required to provide advance disclosure of changes to our services, follow specified error resolution procedures, and reimburse consumers for losses from certain transactions not authorized by the consumer, among other requirements. Additionally, technical violations of consumer protection laws could result in the assessment of actual damages or statutory damages or penalties of up to $1,000 in individual cases or up to $500,000 per violation in any class action and treble damages in some instances; we could also be liable for plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees in such cases. We are subject to, and have paid amounts in settlement of, lawsuits containing allegations that our business violated the EFTA and Regulation E or otherwise advance claims for relief relating to our business practices (e.g., that we improperly held consumer funds or otherwise improperly limited consumer accounts).In October 2016, the CFPB issued a final rule on prepaid accounts with an effective date of October 1, 2017. The rule’s definition of prepaid account includes certain loadable accounts whose primary function is to conduct transactions with multiple, unaffiliated merchants, at ATMs and/or for person-to-person transfers, including certain digital wallets. The rule’s requirements include: the disclosure of fees and other information to the consumer prior to the creation of a prepaid account; the extension of Regulation E liability limits and error-resolution requirements to all prepaid accounts; the application of Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 credit card requirements to prepaid accounts with overdraft and credit features; and the submission of prepaid account agreements to the CFPB and their publication to the general public. We are evaluating the rule and its requirements. Implementation of the rule could require us to make substantial changes to our business practices and the design of certain products, allocate additional resources, and increase our costs, which could negatively affect our business.In May 2015, we entered into a Stipulated Final Judgment and Consent Order (“Consent Order”) with the CFPB in which we settled regulatory claims arising from PayPal Credit practices between 2011 and 2015. The Consent Order included obligations on PayPal to pay $15 million in redress to consumers and a $10 million civil monetary penalty, and required PayPal to make various changes to PayPal Credit disclosures and related business practices. We continue to cooperate and engage with the CFPB and work to ensure compliance with the Consent Order, which may result in us incurring additional costs.PayPal (Europe) offers its services in EU countries through a “passport” notification process through the Luxembourg regulator to regulators in other EU member states pursuant to EU Directives, and has completed the “passport” notification process in all EU member countries. The regulators in these countries could notify PayPal (Europe) of local consumer protection laws that apply to its business, in addition to Luxembourg consumer protection law, and could also seek to persuade the Luxembourg regulator to order PayPal (Europe) to conduct its activities in the local country through a branch office. These or similar actions by these regulators could increase the cost of, or delay, our plans to expand our business in EU countries. 20 Table of Contents Economic and Trade Sanctions We are subject to U.S. economic and trade sanctions administered by OFAC. We have self-reported to OFAC certain transactions that were inadvertently processed but subsequently identified as possible violations of U.S. economic and trade sanctions. In March 2015, we reached a settlement with OFAC regarding possible violations arising from our sanctions compliance practices between 2009 and 2013, prior to the implementation of our real-time transaction scanning program. Subsequently, we have self-reported additional transactions as possible violations, and we have received new subpoenas from OFAC seeking additional information about certain of these transactions. Such self-reported transactions could result in claims or actions against us, including litigation, injunctions, damage awards, fines or penalties, or require us to change our business practices in a manner that could result in a material loss, require significant management time, result in the diversion of significant operational resources or otherwise harm our business. Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing We are subject to various anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws and regulations around the world that prohibit, among other things, our involvement in transferring the proceeds of criminal activities. U.S. and other regulators globally continue to increase their scrutiny of compliance with these obligations, which may require us to further revise or expand our compliance program, including the procedures we use to verify the identity of our customers and to monitor international and domestic transactions. Many countries in which we operate also have anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws and regulations, and we have been and continue to be required to make changes to our compliance program in various jurisdictions in response. Regulators regularly re-examine the transaction volume thresholds at which we must obtain and keep applicable records or verify identities of customers and any change in such thresholds could result in greater costs for compliance. In the EU, the implementation of the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive and the regulation on information accompanying transfer of funds (commonly known as the Revised Wire Transfer Regulation), which both come into effect on June 26, 2017, could make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage, lead to increased friction for customers, and result in a decrease in business. Penalties for non-compliance with the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive could include fines of up to 10% of PayPal (Europe)’s total annual turnover. The EU institutions are also proposing changes to the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive which could be even more stringent. Privacy and Protection of User Data We are subject to a number of laws, rules and directives (which we refer to as “privacy laws”) relating to the collection, use, retention, security, processing and transfer (which we refer to as “process”) of personally identifiable information about our customers and employees (which we refer to as “personal data”) in the countries where we operate. Much of the personal data that we process, especially financial information, is regulated by multiple privacy laws and, in some cases, the privacy laws of multiple jurisdictions. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between or among us, our subsidiaries, and other parties with which we have commercial relationships.Regulatory scrutiny of privacy, data protection, collection, use and sharing of data is increasing on a global basis. There is uncertainty associated with the legal and regulatory environment around privacy and data protection laws, which continue to develop in ways we cannot predict, including with respect to evolving technologies such as cloud computing. Privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and impose inconsistent or conflicting requirements. Complying with varying jurisdictional requirements could increase the costs and complexity of compliance or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business, and violations of privacy and data protection-related laws can result in significant penalties and damage to our brand and business. In addition, compliance with inconsistent privacy laws may restrict our ability to provide products and services to our customers. A determination that there have been violations of privacy or data protection laws could expose us to significant damage awards, fines and other penalties that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business and reputation.In October 2015, the European Court of Justice ruled that the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor framework clauses, one compliance method by which companies could transfer personal data regarding citizens of the EU to the U.S., could no longer be relied upon. The U.S. and EU authorities have agreed in principle on a replacement for Safe Harbor known as “Privacy Shield”. The Privacy Shield approach has not been fully endorsed by all relevant parties and there have already been challenges to this initiative in the European justice system. PayPal has chosen to adopt EU model clauses published by the European Commission as a basis for the export of data from the EU to the U.S. for those parts of our business that had previously relied on Safe Harbor. In addition, because PayPal (Europe) is headquartered in Luxembourg and subject to regulation as a bank in that jurisdiction, we have relied on the “one-stop-shop” concept under which Luxembourg has been our lead data protection regulator in the EU. However, a recent European Court of Justice ruling (Weltimmo) affecting companies that do business in the EU potentially could make us subject to the local data protection laws or regulatory enforcement activities of the various EU member states in which we have established legal entities and which apply privacy laws that are different than, and which may even conflict with, those in Luxembourg.In addition, because of the large number of text messages, emails, phone calls and other communications we send or make to our customers for various business purposes, communication-related privacy laws that provide a specified monetary damage award or fine for each violation could result in particularly significant damage awards or fines. For example, under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”), in the U.S., plaintiffs may seek actual monetary loss or statutory damages of $500 per violation, whichever is greater, and courts may treble the damage award for willful or knowing violations. We have been, are, and may continue to be subject to lawsuits (including class-action lawsuits) containing allegations that our business violated the TCPA. These lawsuits seek damages (including statutory damages) and injunctive relief, among other remedies. Given the large number of communications we send to our customers, a determination that there have been violations of the TCPA or other communications-based statutes could expose us to significant damage awards that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business.The EU has recently adopted a comprehensive overhaul of its data protection regime from the current national legislative approach to a single European Economic Area Privacy Regulation, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which comes into effect in 2018. The proposed EU data protection regime extends the scope of the EU data protection law to all foreign companies processing data of EU residents. It provides for a harmonization of the data protection regulations throughout the EU, thereby making it easier for non-European companies to comply with these regulations. It imposes a strict data protection compliance regime with severe penalties of up to the greater of 4% of worldwide turnover and €20 million and includes new rights such as the “portability” of personal data. Although the GDPR will apply across the EU without a need for local implementing legislation, as has been the case under the current data protection regime, local data protection authorities (“DPAs”) will still have the ability to interpret the GDPR, which has the potential to create inconsistencies on a country-by-country basis. We are evaluating the rule and its requirements. Implementation of the GDPR could require changes to certain of our business practices, thereby increasing our costs.We post on our websites and applications our privacy policies and practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of user data. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any applicable regulatory requirements or orders, or privacy, data protection, information security or consumer protection-related privacy laws and regulations in one or more jurisdictions could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, including class action privacy litigation in certain jurisdictions, subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments and negative publicity, require us to change our business practices, increase the costs and complexity of compliance, and adversely affect our business. Data protection, privacy and information security have become the subject of increasing public, media and legislative concern. If our customers were to reduce their use of our products and services as a result of these concerns, our business could be materially harmed. As noted above, we are also subject to the possibility of security and privacy breaches, which themselves may result in a violation of these privacy laws. 21 Table of Contents If one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their financial or performance obligations to us or fail, we may incur significant losses. We have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the U.S. and abroad. As part of our currency hedging activities, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments with various financial institutions. Certain banks and financial institutions are also lenders under our revolving credit facility. We regularly monitor our exposure to counterparty credit risk, and actively manage this exposure to mitigate the associated risk. Despite these efforts, we may be exposed to the risk of default by, or deteriorating operating results or financial condition or failure of, these counterparty financial institutions. The risk of counterparty default, deterioration or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets. If one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or to access or recover our assets that are deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty’s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties, we could incur significant losses, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. 22 Table of Contents PayPal is not a bank or licensed lender in the U.S. and relies upon third parties to make loans and provide other products critical to our business. As PayPal is neither a chartered financial institution nor licensed to make loans in any state in the U.S., we rely on a third-party chartered financial institution to issue the PayPal Credit consumer product in the U.S., and a different chartered financial institution to issue the PayPal Working Capital product in the U.S. Both of these chartered financial institutions are industrial banks chartered by the State of Utah. In the event of a termination or interruption in the ability of the chartered financial institution that currently issues the PayPal Credit consumer product in the U.S. to lend under the PayPal Credit consumer product, the chartered financial institution that issues the PayPal Working Capital product in the U.S. has agreed to take ownership of (and originate loans with respect to) all PayPal Credit consumer accounts. Nevertheless, any termination or interruption of either bank’s ability to lend could result in the inability or unwillingness to originate any new PayPal Credit or PayPal Working Capital loans. In the event of either bank’s inability or unwillingness to lend, we would either need to reach a similar agreement with another chartered financial institution or obtain our own bank charter or licenses. We may be unable to reach a similar agreement with another partner on favorable terms or at all, and obtaining a bank charter or lending licenses would be a time-consuming and costly process and would subject us to additional laws and regulatory requirements, which could be burdensome and increase our costs. In addition, our commercial relationships with third parties which are federally supervised U.S. financial institutions could subject us to examination by their federal banking regulators with respect to certain services that we provide.In 2015, the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals, Madden v. Midland Funding, LLC (786 F.3d 246 (2d Cir. 2015)), concluded that the buyer of a charged off credit card account could not rely on the National Bank Act's preemption of state interest rate limits for interest at rates imposed by the buyer after charge-off. A petition to the U.S. Supreme Court to review the decision was denied in June 2016, and the case has been remanded to the lower court to be determined in accordance with the ruling of the Second Circuit. The decision has resulted in some uncertainty as to whether non-bank entities purchasing loans originated by a bank may rely on federal preemption of state usury laws, and may create an increased risk of litigation by plaintiffs challenging our ability to collect interest and fees in accordance with the terms of certain loans. Although the Madden decision specifically addressed preemption under the National Bank Act, this decision could support future challenges to federal preemption for other institutions, including FDIC-insured, state chartered industrial banks like those that we rely on to issue our loan products in the U.S. Although we believe the Madden case can be distinguished from the manner in which we offer our credit products, there can be no assurances as to the outcome of any potential litigation, or that the possible impact of such litigation will not have a material adverse impact on our business. Our credit products expose us to additional risks. Our PayPal Credit and PayPal Working Capital products are offered to a wide range of consumers and merchants, and the financial success of these products depends on the effective management of the risk related to these products. The lender for the PayPal Credit product extends credit using proprietary segmentation and credit algorithms and other analytical techniques designed to analyze the credit risk of specific consumers based on their past purchasing and payment history with PayPal as well as their credit scores. Similarly, to assess a merchant who wishes to obtain a PayPal Working Capital advance, among other indicators, the lender applies a proprietary risk model to help predict the merchant's ability to repay the working capital advance. These risk models may not accurately predict the creditworthiness of a consumer or merchant due to inaccurate assumptions about the particular consumer or merchant or the economic environment or limited transaction history, among other factors. The accuracy of these risk models and the ability of the lender and our ability to manage credit risk related to our PayPal Credit and PayPal Working Capital products may also be affected by legal or regulatory changes, competitors’ actions, changes in consumer behavior, changes in the economic environment and other factors.Like other businesses with significant exposure to losses from consumer and merchant credit, we face the risk that PayPal Credit and PayPal Working Capital account holders will default on their payment obligation, creating the risk of potential charge-offs. The non-payment rate among account holders may increase due to, among other things, changes to underwriting standards, worsening economic conditions, such as a recession or greater austerity in various countries, increases in prevailing interest rates, and high unemployment rates. Account holders who miss payments often fail to repay their loans, and account holders who file for protection under the bankruptcy laws generally do not repay their loans.We purchase receivables related to our PayPal Credit products, and originated loans with respect to our PayPal Working Capital Products. If we are unable to fund our purchase of these receivables adequately or in a cost-effective manner, or if we are unable to efficiently manage the cash resources utilized for these purposes, our business could be harmed.Our international expansion of our PayPal Credit product offerings exposes us to additional risks, including those discussed below under the risk factor titled “Our international operations are subject to increased risks, which could harm our business.” 23 Table of Contents Our business may be impacted by political events, war, terrorism, public health issues, natural disasters and other business interruptions. War, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, public health issues and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to the economy and commerce on a global or regional basis, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, our customers, and companies with which we do business. Our business operations are subject to interruption by, among others, natural disasters, fire, power shortages, earthquakes, floods, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond our control. Such events could decrease demand for our products and services or make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products and services to our customers. In the event of a natural disaster, we could incur significant losses, require substantial recovery time and experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations. Changes to our buyer and seller protection programs could increase our loss rate. Our buyer and seller protection programs protect merchants and consumers from fraudulent transactions. In 2015, we increased the scope of our buyer protection program to cover digital goods and intangible goods and services. In addition, consumers who pay through PayPal may have reimbursement rights from their payment card issuer (usually a bank), which in turn will seek recovery from us. The risk of losses from our buyer and seller protection programs are specific to individual buyers, sellers and transactions, and may also be impacted by regional variations to these programs, modifications to these programs resulting from changes in regulatory requirements, or changes that we decide to implement, such as expanding the scope of transactions covered by one or more of these programs. Upon PayPal becoming an independent publicly traded company on July 17, 2015, we extended our protection programs in several countries to cover certain customers’ purchases on eBay, and our costs associated with these programs have therefore increased. Increases in our loss rate, including as a result of changing our buyer and seller protection programs, could harm our business. Our international operations are subject to increased risks, which could harm our business. Our international operations have generated approximately one-half of our net revenues in recent years. In addition to uncertainty about our ability to generate revenues from our foreign operations and expand into international markets, and the foreign currency risks discussed earlier in this “Risk Factors” section under the caption “We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates,” there are risks inherent in doing business internationally on both a domestic (i.e., in-country) and cross-border basis, including:•expenses associated with localizing our products and services and customer data, including offering customers the ability to transact business in the local currency and adapting our products and services to local preferences (e.g., payment methods) with which we may have limited or no experience;•trade barriers and changes in trade regulations;•difficulties in developing, staffing, and simultaneously managing a large number of varying foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences;•stringent local labor laws and regulations;•credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;•profit repatriation restrictions, foreign currency exchange restrictions or extreme fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for a particular currency;•political or social unrest, economic instability, repression, or human rights issues;•geopolitical events, including natural disasters, public health issues, acts of war, and terrorism;•import or export regulations;•compliance with U.S. laws and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, and other local anticorruption laws;•compliance with U.S. and foreign laws designed to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities;•antitrust and competition regulations;•potentially adverse tax developments and consequences;•economic uncertainties relating to sovereign and other debt;•different, uncertain, or more stringent user protection, data protection, privacy, and other laws;•risks related to other government regulation or required compliance with local laws;•data localization requirements;•risks related to multiple overlapping legal or regulatory regimes, which may impose conflicting requirements on us;•national or regional differences in macroeconomic growth rates;•local licensing and reporting obligations; and•increased difficulties in collecting accounts receivable.Violations of the complex foreign and U.S. laws, rules and regulations that apply to our international operations may result in fines, criminal actions, or sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws, violations by our employees, contractors, or agents could nevertheless occur. These risks are inherent in our international operations and expansion, may increase our costs of doing business internationally, and could harm our business. 24 Table of Contents We are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates. We are exposed to interest rate risk from our investment portfolio and from interest-rate sensitive assets underlying the customer balances we hold on our balance sheet as customer accounts. A low interest rate environment or reductions in interest rates may negatively impact our investment income and our net income. In addition, fluctuations in interest rates may adversely impact our customers’ spending levels and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amounts owed to us. Higher interest rates often lead to higher payment obligations by customers to us and other lenders under mortgage, credit card and other consumer loans, which may reduce our customers’ ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore lead to increased delinquencies, charge-offs and allowance for loan and interest receivable which could have an adverse effect on our net income.In July 2015, we entered into a revolving credit facility. As a result, to the extent of our borrowings under the facility, which bear interest at a floating rate, we will be exposed to interest rate fluctuations. Use of our payments services for illegal purposes could harm our business. Our payment system is susceptible to potentially illegal or improper uses, including money laundering, terrorist financing, illegal online gambling, fraudulent sales of goods or services, illicit sales of prescription medications or controlled substances, piracy of software, movies, music, and other copyrighted or trademarked goods (in particular, digital goods), money laundering, bank fraud, child pornography trafficking, prohibited sales of alcoholic beverages or tobacco products, online securities fraud, or to facilitate other illegal activity. Certain activity that may be legal in one country may be illegal in another country, and a merchant may intentionally or inadvertently be found responsible for importing or exporting illegal goods, resulting in liability for us. Changes in law have increased the penalties for intermediaries providing payment services for certain illegal activities and additional payments-related proposals are under active consideration by government authorities. Intellectual property rights owners or government authorities may seek to bring legal action against providers of payments solutions, including PayPal, that are peripherally involved in the sale of infringing items. Any threatened or resulting claims could result in reputational harm, and any resulting liabilities, loss of transaction volume or increased costs could harm our business. Our failure to manage our customer funds and the assets underlying our customer funds properly could harm our business. We hold a substantial amount of funds belonging to our customers, including deposits in customer accounts and funds being remitted to sellers of goods and services. Our ability to manage and account accurately for the assets underlying our customer funds requires a high level of internal controls. As our business continues to grow and we expand our product offerings, we must continue to strengthen our associated internal controls. For example, in March 2016, as approved by the Supervisory Board of PayPal (Europe) and as permitted by the CSSF, certain European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary are being used to extend credit to our European customers. Our success requires significant public confidence in our ability to properly manage our customers’ balances and handle large and growing transaction volumes and amounts of customer funds. Any failure to maintain the necessary controls or to manage our customer funds and the assets underlying our customer funds accurately could result in reputational harm, lead customers to discontinue or reduce their use of our products and result in significant penalties and fines, which could materially harm our business. We are subject to regulatory activity and antitrust litigation under competition laws. We are subject to scrutiny by various government agencies under U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including antitrust and competition laws. An increasing number of jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. Other companies and government agencies have in the past and may in the future allege that our actions violate the antitrust or competition laws of the U.S., individual states, other countries, or the European Commission, or otherwise constitute unfair competition. An increasing number of governments are regulating competition law activities, including increased scrutiny in large markets such as China. Our business agreements or arrangements with customers or other companies could give rise to regulatory action or antitrust litigation. Some regulators, particularly those outside of the U.S., may perceive our business to be used so broadly that otherwise uncontroversial business practices could be deemed anticompetitive. Any claims or investigations, even if without foundation, may be very expensive to defend or respond to, involve negative publicity and substantial diversion of management time and effort, and could result in reputational harm, significant judgments against us, or require us to change our business practices. 25 Table of Contents We are subject to patent litigation. We have repeatedly been sued for allegedly infringing other parties’ patents. At any given time, we are typically a defendant in a number of patent lawsuits and have been notified of several other potential patent disputes. We expect that we will increasingly be subject to patent infringement claims because, among other reasons:•our products and services continue to expand in scope and complexity;•we continue to expand into new business areas, including through acquisitions; and•the number of patent owners who may claim that we, any of the companies that we have acquired, or our customers infringe their patents, and the aggregate number of patents controlled by such patent owners, continues to increase.Such claims may be brought directly against us or against our customers whom we may indemnify either because we are contractually obligated to do so or we choose to do so as a business matter. We believe that an increasing number of these claims against us and other technology companies have been, and continue to be, initiated by third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims. In addition, we have seen significant patent disputes between operating companies in some technology industries. Patent claims, whether meritorious or not, are time-consuming and costly to defend and resolve, and could require us to make expensive changes in our methods of doing business, enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements, make substantial payments to satisfy adverse judgments or settle claims or proceedings, or cease conducting certain operations, which would harm our business. We may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or third parties may allege that we are infringing their intellectual property rights. The protection of our intellectual property, including our trademarks, patents, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, and trade secrets, is important to the success of our business. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on applicable laws and regulations in the U.S. and internationally, as well as a variety of administrative procedures. We also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights when offering or procuring products and services, including confidentiality and invention assignment agreements entered into with our employees and contractors and confidentiality agreements with parties with whom we conduct business.Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are made available. We may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our rights. Although we have generally taken measures to protect our intellectual property rights, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in protecting or enforcing our rights in every jurisdiction, or that contractual arrangements and other steps that we have taken to protect our intellectual property will prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our intellectual property or deter independent development of equivalent or superior intellectual property rights by others. If we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting, registering or using trademarks and trade dress that infringe, dilute or otherwise violate our trademark rights, the value of our brands could be diminished and our business could be adversely affected. Also, we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. We have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to others. These licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation. Any failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or significant costs incurred in doing so, could diminish the value of our intangible assets and materially harm our business.As the number of products in the technology and payments industries increases and the functionality of these products further overlaps, and as we acquire technology through acquisitions or licenses, we may become increasingly subject to intellectual property infringement and other claims. Litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of the patent and other intellectual property rights of others. The ultimate outcome of any allegation is often uncertain and, regardless of the outcome, any such claim, with or without merit, may be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert management’s time and attention from our business, and require us to, among other things, stop providing transaction processing and other payment-related services or redesign, stop selling our products or services, pay substantial amounts to satisfy judgments or settle claims or lawsuits, pay substantial royalty or licensing fees, or satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with certain parties with whom we have commercial relationships. Our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights, or litigation or claims arising out of intellectual property matters, may harm our business. 26 Table of Contents We are regularly subject to general litigation, regulatory disputes, and government inquiries. We are regularly subject to claims, individual and class action lawsuits, government and regulatory investigations, inquiries or requests, and other proceedings involving competition and antitrust law, intellectual property, privacy, data protection, information security, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, sanctions, anti-corruption, consumer protection, accessibility claims, securities, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, services, escheatment of unclaimed or abandoned property, and other matters. In particular, our business faces ongoing consumer protection and intellectual property litigation, as discussed above. The number and significance of these disputes and inquiries have increased as our company has grown larger, our business has expanded in scope and geographic reach, and our products and services have increased in complexity. In addition, the laws, rules and regulations affecting our business, including those pertaining to Internet and mobile commerce, payments services, and credit, are subject to ongoing interpretation by the courts and governmental authorities, and the resulting uncertainty in the scope and application of these laws, rules and regulations increases the risk that we will be subject to private claims and governmental actions alleging violations of those laws, rules and regulations.The scope, outcome and impact of claims, lawsuits, government investigations, and proceedings that we are subject to cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of the outcome, such investigations and proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of management resources, reputational damage, and other factors. Determining reserves for our pending litigation and regulatory proceedings is a complex, fact-intensive process that is subject to management’s judgment. Resolving one or more such legal and regulatory proceedings could potentially require us to make substantial payments to satisfy judgments, fines or penalties or to settle claims or proceedings, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business. These proceedings could also result in reputational harm, criminal sanctions, consent decrees, or orders preventing us from offering certain products or services, requiring a change in our business practices in costly ways or development of non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies. Any of these consequences could materially and adversely affect our business.Certain of our customer agreements contain arbitration provisions with class action waiver provisions that may limit our exposure to consumer class action litigation, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in enforcing these arbitration provisions, or the class action waiver provisions in them, in the future or in any given case. Legislative, administrative or regulatory developments may directly or indirectly prohibit or limit the use of pre-dispute arbitration clauses and class action waiver provisions. Any such prohibitions or limitations on or discontinuation of the use of such arbitration or class action waiver provisions could subject us to additional lawsuits, including additional consumer class action litigation, or materially impact our ability to avoid exposure from consumer class action litigation. We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities. The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation and significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Like many other multinational corporations, we are subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Our determination of our tax liability is always subject to audit and review by applicable domestic and foreign tax authorities, and we are currently undergoing a number of investigations, audits and reviews by taxing authorities throughout the world. Any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could have a negative effect on our business and the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the periods for which such determination is made. While we have established reserves based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventualities, these reserves may prove to be insufficient.In addition, our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated, or by the incurrence of losses, in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, as a result of gains on our foreign exchange risk management program, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items.Various levels of government, such as U.S. federal and state legislatures, and international organizations, such as the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) and the EU, are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative or regulatory action to increase tax revenue. Any such tax reform or other legislative or regulatory actions could increase our effective tax rate. We and our merchants may be subject to sales reporting and record-keeping obligations. A number of U.S. states, the U.S. federal government and foreign countries have implemented or are in the process of implementing reporting or record-keeping obligations on companies that engage in or facilitate ecommerce to improve tax compliance. Additionally, a number of jurisdictions are reviewing whether payment service providers and other intermediaries could be deemed the legal agent of merchants for certain tax purposes. We have modified our software to meet known requirements and expect further modifications will be required to comply with future requirements, which may change our customer experience and increase operational costs. Any failure by us to comply with these and similar reporting and record-keeping obligations could result in substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions, impact our ability to do business in certain jurisdictions, and harm our business. 27 Table of Contents Acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic investments, and other strategic transactions could result in operating difficulties and could harm our business. Acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic investments, and other strategic transactions are important elements of our overall corporate strategy. We expect to continue to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions as part of our overall business strategy, including business combinations, acquisitions, and dispositions of certain businesses, technologies, services, products, and other assets, as well as joint ventures, strategic investments, and commercial and strategic partnerships. These transactions may involve significant challenges and risks, including:•the potential loss of key customers, vendors and other key business partners of the companies we acquire, or dispose of, following and continuing after announcement of our transaction plans;•declining employee morale and retention issues affecting employees of companies that we acquire or dispose of, which may result from changes in compensation, management, reporting relationships, future prospects, or the direction of the acquired or disposed business;•difficulty making strategic hires of new employees;•diversion of management time and a shift of focus from operating the business to the transaction, and in the case of an acquisition, integration and administration;•the need to integrate the operations, systems (including accounting, management, information, compliance, human resource and other administrative systems), technologies, products and personnel of each acquired company, which is an inherently risky and potentially lengthy and costly process;•the inefficiencies and lack of control that may result if such integration is delayed or not implemented, and unforeseen difficulties and expenditures that may arise as a result;•the need to implement or improve controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at companies that, prior to acquisition, may have lacked such controls, procedures and policies or whose controls, procedures and policies did not meet applicable legal, regulatory and other standards;•potential exposure to new or increased regulatory oversight and regulatory obligations associated with new products or entry into new markets;•risks associated with our expansion into new international markets;•risks associated with the complexity of entering into and effective managing joint ventures, strategic investments, and other strategic partnerships•lawsuits resulting from the transaction;•liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including intellectual property and other litigation claims or disputes, violations of laws, rules and regulations, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities;•the potential loss of key employees following the transaction;•the acquisition of new customer and employee personal information, which in and of itself may require regulatory approval and or additional controls, policies and procedures and subject us to additional exposure and additional complexity and costs of compliance; and•our dependence on the accounting, financial reporting, operating metrics and similar systems, controls and processes of acquired businesses and the risk that errors or irregularities in those systems, controls and processes will lead to errors in our financial statements or make it more difficult to manage the acquired business.At any given time we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more of these or other types of transactions, any of which could, individually or in the aggregate, be material to our financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying, negotiating, and consummating favorable transaction opportunities. It may take us longer than expected to fully realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions, and those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Any acquisitions or dispositions may also require us to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt (and increased interest expense), liabilities, and amortization expenses related to intangible assets or write-offs of goodwill, which could adversely affect our results of operations and dilute the economic and voting rights of our stockholders.Joint ventures and minority investment inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, thereby potentially increasing the financial, legal, operational and/or compliance risks associated with the joint venture or minority investment. In addition, we may be dependent on joint venture partners, controlling shareholders, management or other persons or entities who control them may have business interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours. Business decisions or other actions or omissions of the joint venture partners, controlling shareholders, management or other persons or entities who control them may adversely affect the value of our investment, result in litigation or regulatory action against us and otherwise damage our reputation and brand. 28 Table of Contents We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk. We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, including the following:•networks, banks, payment processors, and payment gateways that link us to the payment card and bank clearing networks to process transactions;•unaffiliated third-party lenders to make consumer and merchant loans originated in the U.S. for our PayPal Credit and PayPal Working Capital products, respectively;•third parties that provide loan servicing and customer statements processing;•third parties that provide certain outsourced customer support and product development functions, which are critical to our operations; and•third parties that provide facilities, infrastructure, components and services, including data center facilities and cloud computing.Third parties that we rely on to process transactions may fail or refuse to process transactions adequately, and these and other third parties on whom we rely may breach their agreements with us, refuse to renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms, take actions that degrade the functionality of our services, impose additional costs or requirements on us, or give preferential treatment to competitive services. Financial or regulatory issues, labor issues, or other problems that prevent these third parties from providing services to us or our customers could harm our business. If our service providers do not perform satisfactorily, our operations could be disrupted, which could result in customer dissatisfaction, damage our reputation, and harm our business. Price increases or financial penalties by, or service terminations, disruptions or interruptions at, companies that we rely on to provide services to us or our customers could disrupt our operations and harm our business. Some third parties who provide services to us may have or gain market power and be able to increase their prices to us without competitive constraint. In addition, there can be no assurance that third parties who provide services directly to us or our customers will continue to do so on acceptable terms, or at all. If any third parties were to stop providing services to us or our customers on acceptable terms, including as a result of bankruptcy or other business interruption, we may be unable to procure alternatives from other third parties in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all. Our developer platforms, which are open to merchants and third-party developers, subject us to additional risks. We provide third-party developers with access to application programming interfaces, software development kits and other tools designed to allow them to produce applications for use, with a particular focus on mobile applications. There can be no assurance that merchants or third-party developers will develop and maintain applications and services on our open platforms on a timely basis or at all, and a number of factors could cause such third-party developers to curtail or stop development for our platforms. In addition, our business is subject to many regulatory restrictions. It is possible that merchants and third-party developers who utilize our development platforms or tools could violate these regulatory restrictions and we may be held responsible for such violations, which could harm our business. Our retail point of sale solutions expose us to additional risks. We have announced several retail point of sale solutions, which enable merchants to accept payments using a payments card reader attached to, or otherwise communicating with, a mobile device or to scan payment cards and codes using the mobile device’s embedded camera, and which enable consumers to use their mobile devices to pay at the point of sale. We have entered into strategic partnerships with Visa, MasterCard and Discover to further expand our relationship with these companies in a way that will make it easier for merchants to accept and consumers to choose to pay for transactions utilizing these companies' credit and debit cards. As part of those agreements, we will gain access to each of these partner's tokenization services in the U.S. for in-store point-of-sale PayPal transactions, which we expect will increase the number of point of sale transactions that we process. As we continue to expand our product and service offerings at the retail point of sale, we will face additional risks, including:•increased expectations from offline retailers regarding the reliability and availability of our systems and services and correspondingly lower amounts of downtime, which we may not be able to meet;•significant competition at the retail point of sale, particularly from established payment card providers such as Visa, MasterCard and American Express, many of which have substantially greater resources than we do;•increased targeting by fraudsters; given that our fraud models are less developed in this area, we may experience increases in fraud and associated transaction losses as we adjust to fraudulent activity at the point of sale;•exposure to product liability claims to the extent that hardware devices that we produce for use at the retail point of sale malfunction or are not in compliance with laws, which could result in substantial liability and require product recalls or other actions;•exposure to additional laws, rules and regulations;•increased reliance on third parties involved with processing in-store payments, including independent software providers, electronic point of sale providers, hardware providers (such as cash register and pin-pad providers), payment processors and banks that enable in-store transactions; and•lower operating income than our other payment solutions.Unless we are able to successfully manage these risks, including driving adoption of, and significant volume through, our retail point of sale solutions over time, our business may be harmed. 29 Table of Contents Our success largely depends on key personnel. Because competition for our key employees is intense, we may not be able to attract, retain, and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our business. The loss of key personnel could harm our business. Our future performance depends substantially on the continued services of key personnel, including our executive team and other highly skilled employees, and our ability to attract, retain, and motivate such personnel. Competition for key personnel is intense, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area, where our corporate headquarters are located and where the cost of living is high, and we may be unable to successfully attract, integrate, or retain sufficiently qualified key personnel. In making employment decisions, particularly in the technology and payments industries, job candidates often consider the value of the equity awards they would receive in connection with their employment, and fluctuations in our stock price, or a perception that the market price of our stock may not increase or may increase more slowly than stock prices at other technology or payments companies, may make it more difficult to attract, retain, and motivate employees. We are limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws or policies. In addition, we do not have long-term employment agreements with any of our key personnel and do not maintain any “key person” life insurance policies. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel, or our inability to attract highly qualified key personnel, could harm our business. We are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our products and services. Companies providing online services may be subject to claims relating to information disseminated through them, including claims alleging defamation, libel, breach of contract, invasion of privacy, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, among other things. The laws relating to the liability of companies providing online services for information disseminated through their services are subject to frequent challenges both in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. We are also subject to potential liability to third parties for the customer-provided content on our products and services, particularly in jurisdictions outside the U.S. where the applicable laws are unsettled. If we become liable for information provided by our customers and carried on our products and services, we could be directly harmed and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability, including expending substantial resources or discontinuing certain product or service offerings, which could harm our business. Risks Related to the Separation and Our Operation as an Independent Publicly Traded Company If the distribution, together with certain related transactions, does not qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), eBay, PayPal and eBay stockholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities and, in certain circumstances, we could be required to indemnify eBay for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement. On July 17, 2015, we became an independent publicly traded company through the pro rata distribution by eBay Inc. of 100% our outstanding common stock to eBay’s stockholders (which we sometimes refer to as the “separation” or the “distribution”). eBay received an opinion from its outside legal counsel regarding the qualification of the distribution, together with certain related transactions, as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code. The opinion was based on and relied on, among other things, certain facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements and undertakings of eBay and of us, including those relating to the past and future conduct of eBay and of us. If any of these representations, statements or undertakings were, or became, inaccurate or incomplete, or if eBay or we breach any of our respective covenants in the separation documents, the opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized.Notwithstanding the opinion of counsel, the IRS could determine that the distribution, together with certain related transactions, should be treated as a taxable transaction if the IRS determines that any of these representations, assumptions, or undertakings upon which such opinion was based are incorrect or have been violated or if the IRS disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel. An opinion of counsel is not binding on the IRS or any court and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge the conclusions reached in the opinion. The IRS did not provide any opinion in advance of the separation that our proposed transaction is tax-free.If the distribution, together with certain related transactions, failed to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code, in general, eBay would recognize taxable gain as if it had sold the PayPal common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value, eBay stockholders who received PayPal common stock in the distribution may be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares and we could incur significant liabilities. 30 Table of Contents We may not be able to engage in desirable strategic or capital-raising transactions for a period of time following the separation. In addition, we could be liable for adverse tax consequences resulting from engaging in significant strategic or capital-raising transactions. To preserve the tax-free treatment to eBay of the separation and the distribution, under the tax matters agreement that we entered into with eBay, for a period of time following the distribution, we are generally prohibited from taking certain actions that prevent the distribution and related transactions from qualifying as a transaction that is generally tax-free, for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code. These restrictions may limit our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or other transactions that we or our stockholders consider desirable or may prevent us from engaging in certain capital-raising transactions. We have limited history of operating as an independent, publicly traded company in our current form, and our historical financial information is not necessarily representative of the results that we would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results. The consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K were derived in part from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of eBay and do not necessarily reflect the financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows that we would have achieved as a separate, independent, publicly traded company during the periods presented or those that we will achieve in the future, primarily as a result of the factors described below:•Prior to the separation, our business was operated by eBay as part of its broader corporate organization, rather than as an independent company. eBay or its affiliates performed various corporate functions for us, such as legal, finance, treasury, accounting, tax, auditing, human resources, certain compliance functions, and public affairs. Our historical financial results prior to separation reflect allocations of corporate expenses from eBay for such functions, which are likely to be less than the comparable expenses we would have incurred had we operated as a separate publicly traded company. In addition, we may need to significantly increase our investment in certain of these functions to ensure appropriate levels of administrative, legal and regulatory compliance.•Prior to the separation, our business was integrated with the other businesses of eBay. Historically, we shared economies of scope and scale in costs, employees, vendor relationships and customer relationships. Although we have entered into arm’s length agreements with eBay, including the operating agreement, these arrangements may not retain or fully capture the benefits that we enjoyed as a result of being integrated with eBay and may result in our paying higher charges than in the past for these services. This could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.•As a part of eBay, we benefited from, among other things, the acquisition of new customers from eBay, capital to fund acquisitions, investments and credit, and data from eBay that helped us to manage risks and maintain a low loss rate. In addition, being a part of eBay enabled us to leverage eBay’s technology capabilities, data, commerce platforms and relationships with retailers, brands and large merchants worldwide. The loss of these synergies and benefits could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.•Generally, our working capital requirements and capital for our general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and capital expenditures, were historically satisfied as part of the corporate-wide cash management policies of eBay. We may need to obtain additional financing from banks, through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities, or through strategic relationships or other arrangements, which may or may not be available and may be more costly.•The cost of capital for our business may be higher than eBay’s cost of capital prior to the separation.We may continue to experience significant changes in our cost structure, management, financing, and business operations as a result of operating as an independent company separate from eBay. For additional information, please see “Management’s 31 Table of Contents Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. eBay remains a significant source of our revenues. We continue to derive a significant amount of revenues and operating income from eBay. Our relationship with eBay is governed in part by an operating agreement that was entered into at separation and has a term of five years. When our operating agreement with eBay expires, or if it is terminated prior to its expiration, or if there is a significant change in our relationship with eBay, including if eBay becomes a merchant of record, eliminates or modifies any of its risk management or customer protection programs, directs transactions to a different provider of payment services or offers eBay customers more payment options, our business could be materially harmed. eBay may fail to perform under various agreements that were executed as part of the separation or we may fail to have necessary systems and services in place when certain of the transaction agreements expire. In connection with the separation, we entered into a separation and distribution agreement with eBay as well as various other agreements, including an operating agreement, colocation services agreements, transition services agreements, a tax matters agreement, an employee matters agreement, an intellectual property matters agreement, a data sharing addendum, and a product development agreement. The separation agreement, the tax matters agreement, the employee matters agreement, and the intellectual property matters agreement determine the allocation of assets and liabilities (including by means of licensing) between the companies following the separation for those respective areas and include any necessary indemnifications related to liabilities and obligations. The operating agreement, the colocation services agreements and the data sharing addendum establish certain commercial relationships between eBay and us related to payment processing, credit, information technology infrastructure and data sharing. The transition services agreements provide for the performance of certain services by each company for the benefit of the other for a limited period of time after the separation. If we or eBay is unable to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements, including its respective indemnification obligations, we could incur operational difficulties or losses or be required to make substantial indemnification or other payments to eBay. If we do not have in place our own systems and services, or if we do not have agreements with other providers of these services once these transaction agreements expire or terminate, we may not be able to operate our business effectively and our financial condition and result of operations may be adversely affected. After the separation, certain of our directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their previous or continuing positions at eBay. Because of their current or former positions with eBay, certain of our directors own eBay common stock and equity awards. Following the separation, even though our board of directors consists of a majority of directors who are independent, some of our directors continue to have a financial interest in eBay common stock and equity awards. In addition, one of our directors continues to serve on the eBay board of directors. Continuing ownership of eBay common stock and equity awards or service as a director at both companies could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest if we and eBay were to have disagreements about the agreements between us or face decisions that could have different implications for us and eBay. Risks Related to Our Common Stock The price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly. The price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including, but not limited to:•actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;•changes in financial estimates by us or securities analysts and recommendations by securities analysts;•changes in our capital structure;•speculation, coverage or sentiment in the media or the investment community;•the operating and stock price performance of comparable companies;•changes to the regulatory and legal environment under which we operate; and•market conditions or trends in the payments industry, the industries of merchants and the domestic and worldwide economy as a whole. 32 Table of Contents Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the state courts of the State of Delaware, or, if no state court located in the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the District of Delaware, as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could discourage lawsuits against us and our directors and officers. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that unless the corporation otherwise determines, the state courts of the State of Delaware, or, if no state court located in the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the District of Delaware, will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors or officers to us or our stockholders, any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“DGCL”) or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes with us or our directors or officers, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors and officers. Alternatively, if a court outside of Delaware were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above, we could incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may prevent or delay an acquisition of our company, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock. Certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of deterring coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and by encouraging prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others:•rules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings;•the fact that directors may not be elected, removed or replaced at stockholder-requested special meetings unless a person, entity or group owns at least a majority of our outstanding common stock;•the right of our board to issue preferred stock and to determine the voting, dividend and other rights of preferred stock without stockholder approval; and•the ability of our directors, and not stockholders, to fill vacancies on our board of directors in most circumstances and to determine the size of our board of directors;•the prohibition on stockholders acting by written consent; and•the absence of cumulative rights in the election of directors.We have also elected not to be governed by Section 203 of the DGCL, which provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that acquire, or are affiliated with a person that acquires, more than 15% of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the date on which that person or its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15% of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, however, contains a provision that generally mirrors Section 203 of the DGCL, except that it provides for a 20% threshold instead of the 15% provided for by the DGCL. These provisions could delay or prevent a change of control that our stockholders may favor.Certain of the above provisions were added pursuant to the agreement between eBay Inc. and certain entities under the control of Carl C. Icahn. These provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers. However, these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and may delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in the best interests of us and our stockholders. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors.In addition, an acquisition or further issuance of our stock (including preferred stock) could trigger the application of Section 355(e) of the Code. For a discussion of Section 355(e), see “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” in our registration statement on Form 10, as amended, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Under the tax matters agreement, in such circumstances, we would be required to indemnify eBay for any resulting taxes, which could materially and adversely affect us. Moreover, this indemnity obligation might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control that our stockholders may consider favorable. Please refer to “Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions” and “Description of PayPal’s Capital Stock” in our registration statement on Form 10, as amended, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a more detailed description of these agreements and provisions. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. The following discussion is divided into three sections. The first section, which begins immediately following this paragraph, discusses some of the risks that may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The second section, captioned “Risks Related to the Separation and Our Operation as an Independent Publicly Traded Company,” discusses some of the risks relating to our separation into an independent publicly traded company. The third section, captioned “Risks Related to Our Common Stock,” discusses some of the risks relating to an investment in our Common Stock. You should carefully review all of these sections for important information regarding risks and uncertainties that affect us, in addition to the other information appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition Substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry may harm our business. The global payments industry is highly competitive, and we compete against a wide range of businesses, many of which are larger than we are, have a dominant and secure position, or offer other products and services to consumers and merchants which we do not offer. As online and offline commerce are increasingly converging, the pace of change, innovation and disruption is also increasing. The global payments industry is rapidly changing, highly innovative and increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny, which may negatively affect the competitive landscape. Many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Competition may also intensify as businesses against which we compete or merchants enter into business combinations and alliances, and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business. We compete against a wide range of businesses with varying roles in all forms of payments, including:•paper-based transactions (principally cash and checks);•providers of traditional payment methods, particularly credit and debit cards, and Automated Clearing House transactions (in particular, well-established banks);•payment networks which facilitate payments for credit card users;•providers of “digital wallets” which offer customers the ability to pay online and/or on mobile devices through a variety of payment methods, including with mobile applications, through contactless payments, and with a variety of payment cards;•providers of mobile payments solutions that use tokenized card data approaches and contactless payments (e.g., near field communication functionality or host card emulation functionality) to eliminate the need to swipe or insert a card or enter a personal identification number or password;•payment-card processors that offer their services to merchants, including for “card on file” payments where the merchant invites the consumer to select a payment method for their first transaction, and subsequently uses the same payment method for subsequent transactions;•providers of “person-to-person” payments that facilitate individuals sending money with an email address or mobile phone number;•merchants and merchant associations providing proprietary payment networks to facilitate payments within their own retail network;•money remitters;•providers of card readers for mobile devices and of other point-of-sale and multi-channel technologies; and•providers of virtual currencies and distributed ledger technologies.We often partner with many of these businesses and we consider the ability to continue establishing these partnerships as important to our business. Competition for relationships with these partners is very intense and there can be no assurance we will be able to continue to establish, grow or maintain these partner relationships.We also face competition and potential competition from:•services that provide online merchants the ability to offer their customers the option of paying for purchases from their bank account or paying on credit;•issuers of stored value targeted at online payments;•other global online payment-services providers;•other providers of online account-based payments;•payment services targeting users of social networks and online gaming, including those offering billing to the consumer’s mobile phone account;•mobile payment services between bank accounts;•payment services enabling banks to offer their online banking customers the ability to send and receive payments through their bank account;•ecommerce services that provide special offers linked to a specific payment provider; •services that help merchants accept and manage virtual currencies; and•electronic funds transfer services as a method of payment for both online and offline transactions, particularly in Germany and the Netherlands.Some of these competitors have greater customer bases, volume, scale, resources, and market share than we do, which may provide significant competitive advantages. Some of our competitors may also be subject to less burdensome licensing, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, and other regulatory requirements. They may devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of products and services, and they may offer lower prices or more effectively introduce their own innovative programs and services that adversely impact our growth.We compete primarily on the basis of the following:•ability to attract, retain and engage both merchants and consumers;•ability to show that merchants will achieve incremental sales by offering our PayPal services;•consumer confidence in safety and security of transactions on our Payments Platform, including the ability for consumers to use our PayPal products and services without sharing their financial information with the merchant or the party they are paying;•simplicity of our fee structure;•ability to develop services across multiple commerce channels, including mobile payments and payments at the retail point of sale;•trust in our dispute resolution and buyer and seller protection programs;•customer service;•brand recognition;•website, mobile platform and application onboarding, ease-of-use and accessibility;•the technology- and payment-agnostic nature of our Payments Platform;•system reliability and data security;•ease and quality of integration into third-party mobile applications and operating systems; and•quality of developer tools, such as our application programming interfaces and software development kits.If we are not able to differentiate our business from those of our competitors, drive value for our customers, or effectively align our resources with our goals and objectives, we may not be able to compete effectively against our competitors. Our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threats could materially and adversely harm our business. 12 Table of Contents 13 Table of Contents Substantially all of our net revenues each quarter come primarily from transactions involving payments during that quarter, which may result in significant fluctuations in our operating results that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as well as the trading price of our common stock. Substantially all of our net revenues each quarter come primarily from transactions involving payments during that quarter. As a result, our operating and financial results have varied on a quarterly basis during our limited operating history and may continue to fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including as a result of the risks set forth in this “Risk Factors” section. It is difficult for us to forecast the level or source of our revenues or earnings (loss) accurately. In view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful, and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance. Due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting revenues, it is also difficult to forecast expenses as a percentage of net revenues. Quarterly and annual expenses as a percentage of net revenues reflected in our financial statements may be significantly different from historical or projected rates. Our operating results in one or more future quarters may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. The trading price of our common stock could decline, perhaps substantially, as a result of the factors described in this paragraph. Global and regional economic conditions could harm our business. Our operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions. Adverse economic conditions and events have negatively impacted global and regional financial markets in the past, and uncertainty about global and regional economic events and conditions may result in consumers and businesses postponing spending in response to tighter credit, higher unemployment, financial market volatility, government austerity programs, negative financial news, declines in income or asset values, and other factors. These and other global and regional economic events and conditions could have a material adverse impact on demand for our products and services, including a reduction in the volume and size of transactions on our Payments Platform. In addition, any financial turmoil affecting the banking system or financial markets could cause additional consolidation of the financial services industry, significant financial service institution failures, new or incremental tightening in the credit markets, low liquidity, and extreme volatility or distress in the fixed income, credit, currency, and equity markets, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. If we cannot keep pace with rapid technological developments to provide new and innovative products and services, the use of our products and services and, consequently, our revenues could decline. Rapid, significant, and disruptive technological changes continue to impact the industries in which we operate, including developments in payment card tokenization, mobile, social commerce (i.e., ecommerce through social networks), authentication, virtual currencies, distributed ledger technologies, near field communication and other proximity payment devices, such as contactless payments. We cannot predict the effects of technological changes on our business. In addition to our own initiatives and innovations, we rely in part on third parties, including some of our competitors, for the development of and access to new technologies. We expect that new services and technologies applicable to the industries in which we operate will continue to emerge and may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies we currently use in our products and services. Developing and incorporating new technologies into our products and services may require substantial expenditures, take considerable time, and ultimately may not be successful. In addition, our ability to adopt new products and services and develop new technologies may be inhibited by industry-wide standards, payments networks, changes to laws and regulations, resistance to change from consumers or merchants, third-party intellectual property rights, or other factors. Our success will depend on our ability to develop and incorporate new technologies and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards; if we are unable to do so in a timely or cost-effective manner, our business could be harmed. Changes in how consumers fund their PayPal transactions could harm our business. We pay significant transaction fees when consumers fund payment transactions using credit cards, lower fees when consumers fund payments with debit cards, nominal fees when consumers fund payment transactions by electronic transfer of funds from bank accounts, and nominal fees when consumers fund payment transactions from an existing PayPal account balance or through our PayPal Credit products. Our financial success is sensitive to changes in the rate at which our consumers fund payments using credit and debit cards (collectively, “payment cards”), which can significantly increase our costs. While we provide consumers with the opportunity to use their existing PayPal account balance to fund payment transactions, some of our consumers may prefer to use payment cards, especially if these payment cards offer functionality and benefits not associated with the use of their bank accounts. Some of our offerings, including the ability of consumers to make a limited number of “guest” payments without opening a PayPal account, have a higher rate of payment card funding than our basic product offering. An increase in the portion of our payment volume funded using payment cards or in fees associated with our funding mix, or other events or developments that make it more difficult or costly for us to fund transactions by electronic transfer of funds from bank accounts or existing PayPal account balances, could materially and adversely affect our financial performance and significantly harm our business. Some of our plans to lower our funding costs, including our PayPal Credit products and enabling consumers to defer payment for a short period of time on some transactions, may increase the risk to us of nonpayment by consumers.Negotiated arrangements with payment card networks and/or issuing banks, promoting greater choice and options for consumers to fund payment transactions could have an uncertain impact on our business. We have entered into a strategic partnership with partners such as Visa U.S.A. Inc. (“Visa”), MasterCard International Incorporated (“MasterCard”) and DFS Services LLC (“Discover”) to make it easier for merchants to accept and consumers to pay with these partners’ credit and/or debt cards and allow us to gain access to these partners tokenization services for in-store point of sale PayPal transactions. While we anticipate these and similar strategic partnerships we may enter in the future will result in an increase in the number of transactions and transaction volume that we process, we also anticipate that a greater percentage of customer transactions will be executed using a credit or debit card, which would likely increase our funding costs. If our transaction volume does not increase as expected, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected due to increased costs associated with our funding mix. 14 Table of Contents Our business is subject to cyberattacks and security and privacy breaches. Our business involves the collection, storage, processing and transmission of customers’ personal data, including financial information. In addition, a significant number of our customers authorize us to bill their payment card or bank accounts directly for all transaction and other fees charged by us. We have built our reputation on the premise that our Payments Platform offers customers a secure way to make payments. An increasing number of organizations, including large merchants and businesses, other large technology companies, financial institutions, and government institutions, have disclosed breaches of their information security systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks, including on portions of their websites or infrastructure.The techniques used to obtain unauthorized, improper or illegal access to our systems, our data or customers' data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems are constantly evolving, may be difficult to detect quickly, and often are not recognized until launched against a target. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means, including, among others, hacking into our systems or facilities or those of our customers, partners or vendors, or attempting to fraudulently induce our employees, customers, partners, vendors or other users of our systems into disclosing user names, passwords, payment card information, or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems. Certain efforts may be state-sponsored and supported by significant financial and technological resources, making them even more sophisticated and difficult to detect. We believe that PayPal is a particularly attractive target for such breaches and attacks due to our name and brand recognition and the widespread adoption and use of our products and services. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and customer data and to prevent data loss and other security breaches, and expect to continue to expend significant additional resources to bolster these protections, these security measures cannot provide absolute security. Our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyberattacks or security breaches, and third parties may be able to access our customers’ personal or proprietary information and payment card data that are stored on or accessible through those systems. Our security measures may also be breached due to human error, malfeasance, system errors or vulnerabilities, or other irregularities. Any actual or perceived breach of our security could interrupt our operations, result in our systems or services being unavailable, result in improper disclosure of data, materially harm our reputation and brands, result in significant legal and financial exposure, lead to loss of customer confidence in, or decreased use of, our products and services, and adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, any breaches of network or data security at our customers, partners or vendors (including data center and cloud computing providers) could have similar negative effects. Actual or perceived vulnerabilities or data breaches may lead to claims against us.In addition, under payment card rules and our contracts with our card processors, if there is a breach of payment card information that we store, or that is stored by our direct payment card processing customers, we could be liable to the payment card issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses. We also expect to expend significant additional resources to protect against security or privacy breaches, and may be required to redress problems caused by breaches. Among other reasons, financial services regulators in various jurisdictions, including the U.S. and the European Union (“EU”), have implemented or are considering proposals to impose new authentication requirements on banks and payment processors intended to reduce online fraud, which could impose significant costs, require us to change our business practices, make it more difficult for new customers to join PayPal, and reduce the ease of use of our products, which could harm our business. Additionally, while we maintain insurance policies, they may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches, and we may not be able to collect fully, if at all, under these insurance policies. 15 Table of Contents Systems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our websites, applications, products or services could harm our business. Our systems and those of our services providers and partners may experience service interruptions or degradation because of hardware and software defects or malfunctions, computer denial-of-service and other cyberattacks, human error, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, natural disasters, power losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist attacks, computer viruses or other malware, or other events. Our systems also may be subject to break-ins, sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. In addition, as a provider of payments solutions, we are subject to heightened scrutiny by regulators that may require specific business continuity, resiliency and disaster recovery plans and more rigorous testing of such plans, which may be costly and time-consuming and may divert our resources from other business priorities.We have experienced and expect to continue to experience system failures, denial of service attacks and other events or conditions from time to time that interrupt the availability or reduce or affect the speed or functionality of our products and services. These events have resulted and likely will result in loss of revenue. A prolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in the availability, speed or other functionality of our products and services could materially harm our business. Frequent or persistent interruptions in our services could cause current or potential customers to believe that our systems are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid our products and services, and could permanently harm our reputation and brands. Moreover, to the extent that any system failure or similar event results in damages to our customers or their business partners, these customers or partners could seek significant compensation or contractual penalties from us for their losses and those claims, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and costly for us to address, and could have other consequences described in this “Risk Factors” section under the caption “Our business is subject to cyberattacks and security and privacy breaches.”Our Payments Platform has experienced significant intermittent unavailability. Reliability is particularly critical for us because the full-time availability of our products and services is critical to our goal of gaining widespread acceptance among consumers and merchants for digital payments. We have undertaken certain system upgrades and re-platforming efforts designed to improve our reliability and speed. These efforts are costly and time-consuming, involve significant technical risk and may divert our resources from new features and products, and there can be no guarantee that these efforts will succeed. Because we are a regulated financial institution in certain jurisdictions, frequent or persistent site interruptions could lead to regulatory scrutiny, significant fines and penalties, and mandatory and costly changes to our business practices, and ultimately could cause us to lose existing licenses that we need to operate or prevent or delay us from obtaining additional licenses that we need to expand our business.We also rely on facilities, components and services supplied by third parties, including data center facilities and cloud storage services. If these third parties cease to provide the facilities, components or services, experience operational interference or disruptions, breach their agreements with us, or fail to meet our expectations, our operations could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected, which could result in customer dissatisfaction, damage to our reputation and brands, and materially and adversely affect our business. We do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for all losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of systems failures and similar events. Changes to payment card networks or bank fees, rules, or practices could harm our business. We do not directly access the payment card networks, such as Visa and MasterCard, that enable our acceptance of credit cards and debit cards, including some types of prepaid cards. Accordingly, we must rely on banks or other payment processors to process transactions and must pay fees for the services. From time to time, payment card networks have increased, and may increase in the future, the interchange fees and assessments that they charge for each transaction which accesses their networks. Payment card networks have or may impose special assessments for transactions that are executed through a “digital wallet” such as PayPal’s, and such fees could particularly impact us and significantly increase our costs. Our payment card processors may have the right to pass any increases in interchange fees and assessments on to us as well as increase their own fees for processing. Any changes in interchange fees and assessments could increase our operating costs and reduce our operating income. We have entered into strategic partnerships with Visa and MasterCard to further expand our relationships with these networks in a way that will make it easier for merchants to accept and consumers to choose to pay with Visa and MasterCard credit and debit cards. During the term of the agreements, Visa and MasterCard have each agreed to not enact or impose any fees or rules solely targeted at PayPal. Upon termination of the agreements, PayPal could become subject to special digital wallet fees or other special assessments.In addition, in some jurisdictions, governments have required Visa and MasterCard to reduce interchange fees, or have opened investigations as to whether Visa’s or MasterCard’s interchange fees and practices violate antitrust law. In the U.S., the Federal Reserve Board issued a final rule capping debit card interchange fees at significantly lower rates than Visa or MasterCard previously charged. In the EU, the Multilateral Interchange Fee Regulation limits credit and debit interchange fees for payments and imposes business rules on card processing services. Any material change in credit or debit card interchange rates in the U.S. or other markets, including as a result of changes in interchange fee limitations, could adversely affect our competitive position against traditional credit and debit card service providers. Future changes to those regulations could potentially have an adverse effect on our business.We are required by our processors to comply with payment card network operating rules, including special operating rules for payment service providers to merchants, and we have agreed to reimburse our processors for any fines they are assessed by payment card networks as a result of any rule violations by us or our merchants. The payment card networks set and interpret the card operating rules. From time to time, the networks have alleged that various aspects of our business model violate these operating rules. If such allegations are not resolved favorably, they may result in material fines and penalties or require changes in our business practices that may be costly. The payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or re-interpret existing rules that we or our processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow, or costly to implement. As a result, we could lose our ability to give consumers the option of using payment cards to fund their payments or the choice of currency in which they would like their payment card to be charged. If we are unable to accept payment cards or are meaningfully limited in our ability to do so, our business would be adversely affected.We and our payment card processors have implemented specific business processes for merchants to comply with payment card network operating rules for providing services to merchants. Any failure to comply with these rules could result in fines. We are also subject to fines from payment card networks if we fail to detect that merchants are engaging in activities that are illegal or that are considered “high risk,” primarily the sale of certain types of digital content. For “high risk” merchants, we must either prevent such merchants from using our PayPal services or register such merchants with the payment card networks and conduct additional monitoring with respect to such merchants. Although the amount of these fines has not been material to date, additional fines in the future could become material and could result in a termination of our ability to accept payment cards or require changes in our process for registering new customers, which would materially harm our business. Payment card network rules may also increase the cost of, impose restrictions on, or otherwise negatively impact the development of, our retail point-of-sale solutions, which may negatively impact their deployment and adoption. 16 Table of Contents Failure to deal effectively with fraud, fictitious transactions, bad transactions, and negative customer experiences would increase our loss rate and harm our business, and could severely diminish merchant and consumer confidence in and use of our services. We incur substantial losses due to claims from consumers that merchants have not performed or that their goods or services do not match the merchant’s description. We seek to recover such losses from the merchant, but may not be able to recover in full if the merchant is unwilling or unable to pay. In addition, in the event of the bankruptcy or other business interruption of a merchant that sells goods or services in advance of the date of their delivery or use (e.g., airline, cruise or concert tickets, custom-made goods and subscriptions), we could be liable to the buyers of such goods or services, either through our buyer protection program or through chargebacks on payment cards used by customers to fund their payment. While we have established reserves based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventualities, these reserves may be insufficient.We also incur substantial losses from claims that the consumer did not authorize the purchase, from consumer fraud, from erroneous transmissions and from customers who have closed bank accounts or have insufficient funds in them to satisfy payments. In addition, if losses incurred by us related to payment card transactions become excessive, they could potentially result in our losing the right to accept payment cards for payment, which would harm our business. We have taken measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud, but these measures need to be continually improved and may not be effective against new and continually evolving forms of fraud or in connection with new product offerings. If these measures do not succeed, our business could be harmed. We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We have significant operations internationally that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar, subjecting us to foreign currency risk. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar versus the British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar, and Canadian Dollar impacts the translation of our net revenues generated in these foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar. Additionally, in connection with providing our services in multiple currencies, we generally set our foreign exchange rates twice per day. We may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the times that we set them. Given that we also hold some corporate and customer funds in non-U.S. currencies, our financial results are affected by the translation of these non-U.S. currencies into U.S. dollars. We also have foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. While we regularly enter into transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency translation and balance sheet exposure, it is impossible to predict or eliminate the effects of this exposure. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could significantly impact our financial results. 17 Table of Contents Any factors that reduce cross-border trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business. Cross-border trade (i.e., transactions where the merchant or consumer are in different countries) is an important source of our revenue and profits. Cross-border transactions generally provide higher revenues and operating income than similar transactions that take place within a single country or market. Cross-border trade also represents our primary (and in some cases, our only) presence in certain important markets.Cross-border trade is subject to, and may be impacted by, foreign exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, the potential interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions (e.g., the jurisdiction of the merchant and of the consumer) are often extremely complicated in the context of cross-border trade. Changes to or the interpretation and/or application of laws applicable to cross-border trade could impose additional requirements (which may impose conflicting obligations) and restrictions on cross-border trade and increase the costs associated with cross-border trade. Any factors that increase the costs of cross-border trade or restrict, delay, or make cross-border trade more difficult or impractical would lower our revenues and profits and could harm our business. The United Kingdom’s departure from the EU could adversely affect us. The United Kingdom (“U.K.”) held a referendum on June 23, 2016 in which a majority of voters approved an exit from the EU (“Brexit”). Negotiations are expected to commence to determine the future terms of the U.K.’s relationship with the EU, including, among other things, the terms of trade between the U.K. and the EU. The effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the U.K. reaches to retain access to EU markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. The outcome of this referendum caused volatility in global stock markets and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and uncertainty about the terms and impact of Brexit may continue to do so in the future. Brexit could adversely affect U.K., regional (including European) and worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the British Pound and Euro, which in turn could adversely affect our customers and companies with which we do business, particularly in the U.K. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. In particular, depending on the terms of Brexit, we may face new regulatory costs and challenges, including the following:•we could lose our ability for our EU operations to passport into the U.K. market through the banking license of PayPal (Europe) S.à r.l. et Cie, SCA (“PayPal (Europe)”), our wholly-owned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a bank in Luxembourg, and our corresponding ability to work with Luxembourg regulators as the lead authority for various aspects of our U.K. operations;•we could be required to obtain additional regulatory licensing to operate in the U.K. market, adding costs and potential inconsistency to our business; and•we could also be required to comply with regulatory requirements in the U.K. that are in addition to, or inconsistent with, the regulatory requirements of the EU.Any of these effects of Brexit and others we cannot anticipate could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight, as well as extensive, complex, overlapping and frequently changing rules, regulations and legal interpretations. Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight. For a discussion of how government regulation impacts key aspects of our business, please see “Item 1. Business—Government Regulation” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our business is also subject to laws, rules, regulations, policies and legal interpretations in the markets in which we operate, including, but not limited to, those governing banking, credit, deposit taking, cross-border and domestic money transmission, foreign exchange, privacy, data protection, banking secrecy, payment services (including payment processing and settlement services), consumer protection, economic and trade sanctions, anti-money laundering, and counter-terrorist financing. The legal and regulatory requirements applicable to us are extensive, complex, frequently changing, and increasing in number, and may impose overlapping and/or conflicting requirements or obligations.Financial and political events have increased the level of regulatory scrutiny on the payments industry, and regulatory agencies may view matters or interpret laws and regulations differently than they have in the past and in a manner adverse to our business. Our success and increased visibility may result in increased regulatory oversight and tighter enforcement of rules and regulations that may apply to our business.As we expand and localize our international activities, we are increasingly becoming obligated to comply with the laws of the countries or markets in which we operate. In addition, because our services are accessible worldwide and we facilitate sales of goods and provide services to customers worldwide, one or more jurisdictions may claim that we or our customers are required to comply with their laws. Laws regulating the Internet, mobile and related technologies outside of the U.S. often impose different, more specific, or even conflicting obligations on us, as well as broader liability. For example, certain transactions that may be permissible in a local jurisdiction may be prohibited by regulations of U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) or U.S. anti-money laundering or counter-terrorist financing regulations.Any failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or new laws and regulations (including changes to or expansion of the interpretation of those laws and regulations), including those discussed in this risk factor, may subject us to significant fines, penalties, criminal and civil lawsuits, forfeiture of significant assets, and other enforcement actions in one or more jurisdictions; result in additional compliance and licensure requirements; increase regulatory scrutiny of our business; restrict our operations; force us to change our business practices, make product or operational changes or delay planned product launches or improvements. The foregoing could, individually or in the aggregate, expose us to significant liability, impose significant costs, require us to expend substantial resources, increase the cost and complexity of compliance, damage our brands and business, make our products and services less attractive, result in the loss of customers, limit our ability to grow the business, adversely affect our results of operations, and harm our reputation. The complexity of U.S. federal and state regulatory and enforcement regimes, coupled with the global scope of our operations and the evolving global regulatory environment, could result in a single event giving rise to a large number of overlapping investigations and legal and regulatory proceedings by multiple government authorities in different jurisdictions. We have implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws, and regulations, but there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations. 18 Table of Contents Payments Regulation In the U.S., PayPal, Inc. has obtained licenses to operate as a money transmitter (or its equivalent) in the states where it is required, as well as in the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. These licenses include not only the PayPal branded products and services in these states, but also our Venmo and Xoom branded products and services. As a licensed money transmitter, PayPal is subject to restrictions with respect to the investment of customer funds, reporting requirements, bonding requirements and inspection by state regulatory agencies. Accordingly, if we violate these laws or regulations, we could be subject to liability and/or additional restrictions, forced to cease doing business with residents of certain states, forced to change our business practices or be required to obtain additional licenses or regulatory approvals that could impose substantial costs.While we currently allow our customers with credit cards to send payments from approximately 200 markets, we allow customers in only approximately half of those markets (including the U.S.) to also receive payments, in some cases with significant restrictions on the manner in which customers can withdraw funds. These limitations may affect our ability to grow our business in these markets. Of the markets whose residents can use our PayPal services, almost 30 of them are in member states of the EU. We provide our services to customers in the EU through PayPal (Europe), our wholly-owned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a bank in Luxembourg. Accordingly, PayPal (Europe) is subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if it violates the disclosure, reporting, anti-money-laundering, capitalization, fund management, corporate governance, privacy, data protection, information security, banking secrecy, taxation, sanctions, or other requirements imposed on Luxembourg banks. In addition, EU laws and regulations are typically subject to different and potentially inconsistent interpretations by the countries that are members of the EU, which can make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage. Moreover, the countries that are members of the EU may each have different and potentially inconsistent interpretations of regulations implementing the EU Payment Services Directive and the E-Money Directive, which could make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage. The Revised Payment Services Directive (“PSD2”) entered into force in January 2016 and will need to be implemented into national legislation by January 2018. The implementation of the PSD2 may negatively affect our business. Finally, if PayPal (Europe) exceed certain thresholds, or if the European Central Bank (“ECB”) determines that PayPal (Europe) is a significant supervised entity or that some activity of PayPal (Europe) is subject to oversight by the ECB, PayPal (Europe) or certain of its activities could become directly regulated by the ECB in addition to the Luxembourg regulator, the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier, as its national supervisor, which could subject us to additional requirements and would likely increase compliance costs.In Australia, we serve our customers through PayPal Australia Pty. Ltd. (“PayPal Australia”), which is licensed by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission as a provider of a non-cash payment product and by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority as a purchased payment facility provider, which is a type of authorized depository institution. Accordingly, PayPal Australia is subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if it violates the product disclosure, reporting, anti-money laundering, capital requirements, privacy, corporate governance or other requirements imposed on Australian depository institutions.In many of the other markets in which we do business, we serve our customers through PayPal Pte. Ltd., our wholly-owned subsidiary that is based in Singapore. PayPal Pte. Ltd. is supervised by the Monetary Authority of Singapore and is designated as a holder of a stored value facility and does not hold a remittance license. As a result, PayPal Pte. Ltd. is not able to offer outbound remittance payments (including donations to charities) from Singapore, and can only offer payments for the purchase of goods and services in Singapore. In many of the markets (other than Singapore) served by PayPal Pte. Ltd., it is unclear and uncertain whether our Singapore-based service is subject only to Singapore law or, if it is subject to the application of local laws, whether such local laws would require a payment processor like us to be licensed as a payments service, bank, financial institution or otherwise.We are also subject to regulation in other markets in which we do business and we have been and expect to continue to be required to apply for various licenses, certifications and regulatory approvals in a number of the countries where we provide our services. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such licenses, certifications, and approvals. Even if we were able to obtain such licenses, certifications, and approvals, there are substantial costs and potential product changes involved in maintaining such licenses, certifications, and approvals, and we could be subject to fines or other enforcement action if we are found to violate disclosure, reporting, anti-money laundering, capitalization, corporate governance or other requirements of such licenses. These factors could impose substantial additional costs and involve considerable delay to the development or provision of our products or services, or could require significant and costly operational changes or prevent us from providing any products or services in a given market.In many other countries it may not be clear whether we are required to be licensed as a payment services provider, bank, financial institution or otherwise. In such markets, we may rely on local banks to process payments and conduct foreign exchange transactions in local currency. Local regulators may use their power to slow or halt payments to local merchants conducted through local banks or otherwise prohibit us from doing business in a country. Such regulatory actions or the need to obtain licenses, certifications or other regulatory approvals could impose substantial costs, involve considerable delay to the provision or development of our services, require significant and costly operational changes, impose restrictions, limitations, or additional requirements on our business, or prevent us from providing any products or services in a given market. For example, in June 2016, we suspended our operations in Turkey following cease and desist instructions from Turkey’s regulatory body, Bankacýlýk Düzenleme Ve Denetleme Kurumu (“BDDK”), following the BDDK’s rejection of our application for an e-money payments license. 19 Table of Contents Consumer Protection The financial services sector is subject to significant regulation and we are subject to consumer protection laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. In the U.S., we are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations applicable to our activities, including the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (“EFTA”) and Regulation E as implemented by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). Under such regulations we are required to provide advance disclosure of changes to our services, follow specified error resolution procedures, and reimburse consumers for losses from certain transactions not authorized by the consumer, among other requirements. Additionally, technical violations of consumer protection laws could result in the assessment of actual damages or statutory damages or penalties of up to $1,000 in individual cases or up to $500,000 per violation in any class action and treble damages in some instances; we could also be liable for plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees in such cases. We are subject to, and have paid amounts in settlement of, lawsuits containing allegations that our business violated the EFTA and Regulation E or otherwise advance claims for relief relating to our business practices (e.g., that we improperly held consumer funds or otherwise improperly limited consumer accounts).In October 2016, the CFPB issued a final rule on prepaid accounts with an effective date of October 1, 2017. The rule’s definition of prepaid account includes certain loadable accounts whose primary function is to conduct transactions with multiple, unaffiliated merchants, at ATMs and/or for person-to-person transfers, including certain digital wallets. The rule’s requirements include: the disclosure of fees and other information to the consumer prior to the creation of a prepaid account; the extension of Regulation E liability limits and error-resolution requirements to all prepaid accounts; the application of Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 credit card requirements to prepaid accounts with overdraft and credit features; and the submission of prepaid account agreements to the CFPB and their publication to the general public. We are evaluating the rule and its requirements. Implementation of the rule could require us to make substantial changes to our business practices and the design of certain products, allocate additional resources, and increase our costs, which could negatively affect our business.In May 2015, we entered into a Stipulated Final Judgment and Consent Order (“Consent Order”) with the CFPB in which we settled regulatory claims arising from PayPal Credit practices between 2011 and 2015. The Consent Order included obligations on PayPal to pay $15 million in redress to consumers and a $10 million civil monetary penalty, and required PayPal to make various changes to PayPal Credit disclosures and related business practices. We continue to cooperate and engage with the CFPB and work to ensure compliance with the Consent Order, which may result in us incurring additional costs.PayPal (Europe) offers its services in EU countries through a “passport” notification process through the Luxembourg regulator to regulators in other EU member states pursuant to EU Directives, and has completed the “passport” notification process in all EU member countries. The regulators in these countries could notify PayPal (Europe) of local consumer protection laws that apply to its business, in addition to Luxembourg consumer protection law, and could also seek to persuade the Luxembourg regulator to order PayPal (Europe) to conduct its activities in the local country through a branch office. These or similar actions by these regulators could increase the cost of, or delay, our plans to expand our business in EU countries. 20 Table of Contents Economic and Trade Sanctions We are subject to U.S. economic and trade sanctions administered by OFAC. We have self-reported to OFAC certain transactions that were inadvertently processed but subsequently identified as possible violations of U.S. economic and trade sanctions. In March 2015, we reached a settlement with OFAC regarding possible violations arising from our sanctions compliance practices between 2009 and 2013, prior to the implementation of our real-time transaction scanning program. Subsequently, we have self-reported additional transactions as possible violations, and we have received new subpoenas from OFAC seeking additional information about certain of these transactions. Such self-reported transactions could result in claims or actions against us, including litigation, injunctions, damage awards, fines or penalties, or require us to change our business practices in a manner that could result in a material loss, require significant management time, result in the diversion of significant operational resources or otherwise harm our business. Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing We are subject to various anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws and regulations around the world that prohibit, among other things, our involvement in transferring the proceeds of criminal activities. U.S. and other regulators globally continue to increase their scrutiny of compliance with these obligations, which may require us to further revise or expand our compliance program, including the procedures we use to verify the identity of our customers and to monitor international and domestic transactions. Many countries in which we operate also have anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws and regulations, and we have been and continue to be required to make changes to our compliance program in various jurisdictions in response. Regulators regularly re-examine the transaction volume thresholds at which we must obtain and keep applicable records or verify identities of customers and any change in such thresholds could result in greater costs for compliance. In the EU, the implementation of the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive and the regulation on information accompanying transfer of funds (commonly known as the Revised Wire Transfer Regulation), which both come into effect on June 26, 2017, could make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage, lead to increased friction for customers, and result in a decrease in business. Penalties for non-compliance with the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive could include fines of up to 10% of PayPal (Europe)’s total annual turnover. The EU institutions are also proposing changes to the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive which could be even more stringent. Privacy and Protection of User Data We are subject to a number of laws, rules and directives (which we refer to as “privacy laws”) relating to the collection, use, retention, security, processing and transfer (which we refer to as “process”) of personally identifiable information about our customers and employees (which we refer to as “personal data”) in the countries where we operate. Much of the personal data that we process, especially financial information, is regulated by multiple privacy laws and, in some cases, the privacy laws of multiple jurisdictions. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between or among us, our subsidiaries, and other parties with which we have commercial relationships.Regulatory scrutiny of privacy, data protection, collection, use and sharing of data is increasing on a global basis. There is uncertainty associated with the legal and regulatory environment around privacy and data protection laws, which continue to develop in ways we cannot predict, including with respect to evolving technologies such as cloud computing. Privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and impose inconsistent or conflicting requirements. Complying with varying jurisdictional requirements could increase the costs and complexity of compliance or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business, and violations of privacy and data protection-related laws can result in significant penalties and damage to our brand and business. In addition, compliance with inconsistent privacy laws may restrict our ability to provide products and services to our customers. A determination that there have been violations of privacy or data protection laws could expose us to significant damage awards, fines and other penalties that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business and reputation.In October 2015, the European Court of Justice ruled that the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor framework clauses, one compliance method by which companies could transfer personal data regarding citizens of the EU to the U.S., could no longer be relied upon. The U.S. and EU authorities have agreed in principle on a replacement for Safe Harbor known as “Privacy Shield”. The Privacy Shield approach has not been fully endorsed by all relevant parties and there have already been challenges to this initiative in the European justice system. PayPal has chosen to adopt EU model clauses published by the European Commission as a basis for the export of data from the EU to the U.S. for those parts of our business that had previously relied on Safe Harbor. In addition, because PayPal (Europe) is headquartered in Luxembourg and subject to regulation as a bank in that jurisdiction, we have relied on the “one-stop-shop” concept under which Luxembourg has been our lead data protection regulator in the EU. However, a recent European Court of Justice ruling (Weltimmo) affecting companies that do business in the EU potentially could make us subject to the local data protection laws or regulatory enforcement activities of the various EU member states in which we have established legal entities and which apply privacy laws that are different than, and which may even conflict with, those in Luxembourg.In addition, because of the large number of text messages, emails, phone calls and other communications we send or make to our customers for various business purposes, communication-related privacy laws that provide a specified monetary damage award or fine for each violation could result in particularly significant damage awards or fines. For example, under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”), in the U.S., plaintiffs may seek actual monetary loss or statutory damages of $500 per violation, whichever is greater, and courts may treble the damage award for willful or knowing violations. We have been, are, and may continue to be subject to lawsuits (including class-action lawsuits) containing allegations that our business violated the TCPA. These lawsuits seek damages (including statutory damages) and injunctive relief, among other remedies. Given the large number of communications we send to our customers, a determination that there have been violations of the TCPA or other communications-based statutes could expose us to significant damage awards that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business.The EU has recently adopted a comprehensive overhaul of its data protection regime from the current national legislative approach to a single European Economic Area Privacy Regulation, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which comes into effect in 2018. The proposed EU data protection regime extends the scope of the EU data protection law to all foreign companies processing data of EU residents. It provides for a harmonization of the data protection regulations throughout the EU, thereby making it easier for non-European companies to comply with these regulations. It imposes a strict data protection compliance regime with severe penalties of up to the greater of 4% of worldwide turnover and €20 million and includes new rights such as the “portability” of personal data. Although the GDPR will apply across the EU without a need for local implementing legislation, as has been the case under the current data protection regime, local data protection authorities (“DPAs”) will still have the ability to interpret the GDPR, which has the potential to create inconsistencies on a country-by-country basis. We are evaluating the rule and its requirements. Implementation of the GDPR could require changes to certain of our business practices, thereby increasing our costs.We post on our websites and applications our privacy policies and practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of user data. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any applicable regulatory requirements or orders, or privacy, data protection, information security or consumer protection-related privacy laws and regulations in one or more jurisdictions could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, including class action privacy litigation in certain jurisdictions, subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments and negative publicity, require us to change our business practices, increase the costs and complexity of compliance, and adversely affect our business. Data protection, privacy and information security have become the subject of increasing public, media and legislative concern. If our customers were to reduce their use of our products and services as a result of these concerns, our business could be materially harmed. As noted above, we are also subject to the possibility of security and privacy breaches, which themselves may result in a violation of these privacy laws. 21 Table of Contents If one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their financial or performance obligations to us or fail, we may incur significant losses. We have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the U.S. and abroad. As part of our currency hedging activities, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments with various financial institutions. Certain banks and financial institutions are also lenders under our revolving credit facility. We regularly monitor our exposure to counterparty credit risk, and actively manage this exposure to mitigate the associated risk. Despite these efforts, we may be exposed to the risk of default by, or deteriorating operating results or financial condition or failure of, these counterparty financial institutions. The risk of counterparty default, deterioration or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets. If one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or to access or recover our assets that are deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty’s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties, we could incur significant losses, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. 22 Table of Contents PayPal is not a bank or licensed lender in the U.S. and relies upon third parties to make loans and provide other products critical to our business. As PayPal is neither a chartered financial institution nor licensed to make loans in any state in the U.S., we rely on a third-party chartered financial institution to issue the PayPal Credit consumer product in the U.S., and a different chartered financial institution to issue the PayPal Working Capital product in the U.S. Both of these chartered financial institutions are industrial banks chartered by the State of Utah. In the event of a termination or interruption in the ability of the chartered financial institution that currently issues the PayPal Credit consumer product in the U.S. to lend under the PayPal Credit consumer product, the chartered financial institution that issues the PayPal Working Capital product in the U.S. has agreed to take ownership of (and originate loans with respect to) all PayPal Credit consumer accounts. Nevertheless, any termination or interruption of either bank’s ability to lend could result in the inability or unwillingness to originate any new PayPal Credit or PayPal Working Capital loans. In the event of either bank’s inability or unwillingness to lend, we would either need to reach a similar agreement with another chartered financial institution or obtain our own bank charter or licenses. We may be unable to reach a similar agreement with another partner on favorable terms or at all, and obtaining a bank charter or lending licenses would be a time-consuming and costly process and would subject us to additional laws and regulatory requirements, which could be burdensome and increase our costs. In addition, our commercial relationships with third parties which are federally supervised U.S. financial institutions could subject us to examination by their federal banking regulators with respect to certain services that we provide.In 2015, the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals, Madden v. Midland Funding, LLC (786 F.3d 246 (2d Cir. 2015)), concluded that the buyer of a charged off credit card account could not rely on the National Bank Act's preemption of state interest rate limits for interest at rates imposed by the buyer after charge-off. A petition to the U.S. Supreme Court to review the decision was denied in June 2016, and the case has been remanded to the lower court to be determined in accordance with the ruling of the Second Circuit. The decision has resulted in some uncertainty as to whether non-bank entities purchasing loans originated by a bank may rely on federal preemption of state usury laws, and may create an increased risk of litigation by plaintiffs challenging our ability to collect interest and fees in accordance with the terms of certain loans. Although the Madden decision specifically addressed preemption under the National Bank Act, this decision could support future challenges to federal preemption for other institutions, including FDIC-insured, state chartered industrial banks like those that we rely on to issue our loan products in the U.S. Although we believe the Madden case can be distinguished from the manner in which we offer our credit products, there can be no assurances as to the outcome of any potential litigation, or that the possible impact of such litigation will not have a material adverse impact on our business. Our credit products expose us to additional risks. Our PayPal Credit and PayPal Working Capital products are offered to a wide range of consumers and merchants, and the financial success of these products depends on the effective management of the risk related to these products. The lender for the PayPal Credit product extends credit using proprietary segmentation and credit algorithms and other analytical techniques designed to analyze the credit risk of specific consumers based on their past purchasing and payment history with PayPal as well as their credit scores. Similarly, to assess a merchant who wishes to obtain a PayPal Working Capital advance, among other indicators, the lender applies a proprietary risk model to help predict the merchant's ability to repay the working capital advance. These risk models may not accurately predict the creditworthiness of a consumer or merchant due to inaccurate assumptions about the particular consumer or merchant or the economic environment or limited transaction history, among other factors. The accuracy of these risk models and the ability of the lender and our ability to manage credit risk related to our PayPal Credit and PayPal Working Capital products may also be affected by legal or regulatory changes, competitors’ actions, changes in consumer behavior, changes in the economic environment and other factors.Like other businesses with significant exposure to losses from consumer and merchant credit, we face the risk that PayPal Credit and PayPal Working Capital account holders will default on their payment obligation, creating the risk of potential charge-offs. The non-payment rate among account holders may increase due to, among other things, changes to underwriting standards, worsening economic conditions, such as a recession or greater austerity in various countries, increases in prevailing interest rates, and high unemployment rates. Account holders who miss payments often fail to repay their loans, and account holders who file for protection under the bankruptcy laws generally do not repay their loans.We purchase receivables related to our PayPal Credit products, and originated loans with respect to our PayPal Working Capital Products. If we are unable to fund our purchase of these receivables adequately or in a cost-effective manner, or if we are unable to efficiently manage the cash resources utilized for these purposes, our business could be harmed.Our international expansion of our PayPal Credit product offerings exposes us to additional risks, including those discussed below under the risk factor titled “Our international operations are subject to increased risks, which could harm our business.” 23 Table of Contents Our business may be impacted by political events, war, terrorism, public health issues, natural disasters and other business interruptions. War, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, public health issues and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to the economy and commerce on a global or regional basis, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, our customers, and companies with which we do business. Our business operations are subject to interruption by, among others, natural disasters, fire, power shortages, earthquakes, floods, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond our control. Such events could decrease demand for our products and services or make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products and services to our customers. In the event of a natural disaster, we could incur significant losses, require substantial recovery time and experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations. Changes to our buyer and seller protection programs could increase our loss rate. Our buyer and seller protection programs protect merchants and consumers from fraudulent transactions. In 2015, we increased the scope of our buyer protection program to cover digital goods and intangible goods and services. In addition, consumers who pay through PayPal may have reimbursement rights from their payment card issuer (usually a bank), which in turn will seek recovery from us. The risk of losses from our buyer and seller protection programs are specific to individual buyers, sellers and transactions, and may also be impacted by regional variations to these programs, modifications to these programs resulting from changes in regulatory requirements, or changes that we decide to implement, such as expanding the scope of transactions covered by one or more of these programs. Upon PayPal becoming an independent publicly traded company on July 17, 2015, we extended our protection programs in several countries to cover certain customers’ purchases on eBay, and our costs associated with these programs have therefore increased. Increases in our loss rate, including as a result of changing our buyer and seller protection programs, could harm our business. Our international operations are subject to increased risks, which could harm our business. Our international operations have generated approximately one-half of our net revenues in recent years. In addition to uncertainty about our ability to generate revenues from our foreign operations and expand into international markets, and the foreign currency risks discussed earlier in this “Risk Factors” section under the caption “We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates,” there are risks inherent in doing business internationally on both a domestic (i.e., in-country) and cross-border basis, including:•expenses associated with localizing our products and services and customer data, including offering customers the ability to transact business in the local currency and adapting our products and services to local preferences (e.g., payment methods) with which we may have limited or no experience;•trade barriers and changes in trade regulations;•difficulties in developing, staffing, and simultaneously managing a large number of varying foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences;•stringent local labor laws and regulations;•credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;•profit repatriation restrictions, foreign currency exchange restrictions or extreme fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for a particular currency;•political or social unrest, economic instability, repression, or human rights issues;•geopolitical events, including natural disasters, public health issues, acts of war, and terrorism;•import or export regulations;•compliance with U.S. laws and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, and other local anticorruption laws;•compliance with U.S. and foreign laws designed to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities;•antitrust and competition regulations;•potentially adverse tax developments and consequences;•economic uncertainties relating to sovereign and other debt;•different, uncertain, or more stringent user protection, data protection, privacy, and other laws;•risks related to other government regulation or required compliance with local laws;•data localization requirements;•risks related to multiple overlapping legal or regulatory regimes, which may impose conflicting requirements on us;•national or regional differences in macroeconomic growth rates;•local licensing and reporting obligations; and•increased difficulties in collecting accounts receivable.Violations of the complex foreign and U.S. laws, rules and regulations that apply to our international operations may result in fines, criminal actions, or sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws, violations by our employees, contractors, or agents could nevertheless occur. These risks are inherent in our international operations and expansion, may increase our costs of doing business internationally, and could harm our business. 24 Table of Contents We are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates. We are exposed to interest rate risk from our investment portfolio and from interest-rate sensitive assets underlying the customer balances we hold on our balance sheet as customer accounts. A low interest rate environment or reductions in interest rates may negatively impact our investment income and our net income. In addition, fluctuations in interest rates may adversely impact our customers’ spending levels and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amounts owed to us. Higher interest rates often lead to higher payment obligations by customers to us and other lenders under mortgage, credit card and other consumer loans, which may reduce our customers’ ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore lead to increased delinquencies, charge-offs and allowance for loan and interest receivable which could have an adverse effect on our net income.In July 2015, we entered into a revolving credit facility. As a result, to the extent of our borrowings under the facility, which bear interest at a floating rate, we will be exposed to interest rate fluctuations. Use of our payments services for illegal purposes could harm our business. Our payment system is susceptible to potentially illegal or improper uses, including money laundering, terrorist financing, illegal online gambling, fraudulent sales of goods or services, illicit sales of prescription medications or controlled substances, piracy of software, movies, music, and other copyrighted or trademarked goods (in particular, digital goods), money laundering, bank fraud, child pornography trafficking, prohibited sales of alcoholic beverages or tobacco products, online securities fraud, or to facilitate other illegal activity. Certain activity that may be legal in one country may be illegal in another country, and a merchant may intentionally or inadvertently be found responsible for importing or exporting illegal goods, resulting in liability for us. Changes in law have increased the penalties for intermediaries providing payment services for certain illegal activities and additional payments-related proposals are under active consideration by government authorities. Intellectual property rights owners or government authorities may seek to bring legal action against providers of payments solutions, including PayPal, that are peripherally involved in the sale of infringing items. Any threatened or resulting claims could result in reputational harm, and any resulting liabilities, loss of transaction volume or increased costs could harm our business. Our failure to manage our customer funds and the assets underlying our customer funds properly could harm our business. We hold a substantial amount of funds belonging to our customers, including deposits in customer accounts and funds being remitted to sellers of goods and services. Our ability to manage and account accurately for the assets underlying our customer funds requires a high level of internal controls. As our business continues to grow and we expand our product offerings, we must continue to strengthen our associated internal controls. For example, in March 2016, as approved by the Supervisory Board of PayPal (Europe) and as permitted by the CSSF, certain European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary are being used to extend credit to our European customers. Our success requires significant public confidence in our ability to properly manage our customers’ balances and handle large and growing transaction volumes and amounts of customer funds. Any failure to maintain the necessary controls or to manage our customer funds and the assets underlying our customer funds accurately could result in reputational harm, lead customers to discontinue or reduce their use of our products and result in significant penalties and fines, which could materially harm our business. We are subject to regulatory activity and antitrust litigation under competition laws. We are subject to scrutiny by various government agencies under U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including antitrust and competition laws. An increasing number of jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. Other companies and government agencies have in the past and may in the future allege that our actions violate the antitrust or competition laws of the U.S., individual states, other countries, or the European Commission, or otherwise constitute unfair competition. An increasing number of governments are regulating competition law activities, including increased scrutiny in large markets such as China. Our business agreements or arrangements with customers or other companies could give rise to regulatory action or antitrust litigation. Some regulators, particularly those outside of the U.S., may perceive our business to be used so broadly that otherwise uncontroversial business practices could be deemed anticompetitive. Any claims or investigations, even if without foundation, may be very expensive to defend or respond to, involve negative publicity and substantial diversion of management time and effort, and could result in reputational harm, significant judgments against us, or require us to change our business practices. 25 Table of Contents We are subject to patent litigation. We have repeatedly been sued for allegedly infringing other parties’ patents. At any given time, we are typically a defendant in a number of patent lawsuits and have been notified of several other potential patent disputes. We expect that we will increasingly be subject to patent infringement claims because, among other reasons:•our products and services continue to expand in scope and complexity;•we continue to expand into new business areas, including through acquisitions; and•the number of patent owners who may claim that we, any of the companies that we have acquired, or our customers infringe their patents, and the aggregate number of patents controlled by such patent owners, continues to increase.Such claims may be brought directly against us or against our customers whom we may indemnify either because we are contractually obligated to do so or we choose to do so as a business matter. We believe that an increasing number of these claims against us and other technology companies have been, and continue to be, initiated by third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims. In addition, we have seen significant patent disputes between operating companies in some technology industries. Patent claims, whether meritorious or not, are time-consuming and costly to defend and resolve, and could require us to make expensive changes in our methods of doing business, enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements, make substantial payments to satisfy adverse judgments or settle claims or proceedings, or cease conducting certain operations, which would harm our business. We may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or third parties may allege that we are infringing their intellectual property rights. The protection of our intellectual property, including our trademarks, patents, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, and trade secrets, is important to the success of our business. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on applicable laws and regulations in the U.S. and internationally, as well as a variety of administrative procedures. We also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights when offering or procuring products and services, including confidentiality and invention assignment agreements entered into with our employees and contractors and confidentiality agreements with parties with whom we conduct business.Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are made available. We may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our rights. Although we have generally taken measures to protect our intellectual property rights, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in protecting or enforcing our rights in every jurisdiction, or that contractual arrangements and other steps that we have taken to protect our intellectual property will prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our intellectual property or deter independent development of equivalent or superior intellectual property rights by others. If we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting, registering or using trademarks and trade dress that infringe, dilute or otherwise violate our trademark rights, the value of our brands could be diminished and our business could be adversely affected. Also, we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. We have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to others. These licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation. Any failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or significant costs incurred in doing so, could diminish the value of our intangible assets and materially harm our business.As the number of products in the technology and payments industries increases and the functionality of these products further overlaps, and as we acquire technology through acquisitions or licenses, we may become increasingly subject to intellectual property infringement and other claims. Litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of the patent and other intellectual property rights of others. The ultimate outcome of any allegation is often uncertain and, regardless of the outcome, any such claim, with or without merit, may be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert management’s time and attention from our business, and require us to, among other things, stop providing transaction processing and other payment-related services or redesign, stop selling our products or services, pay substantial amounts to satisfy judgments or settle claims or lawsuits, pay substantial royalty or licensing fees, or satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with certain parties with whom we have commercial relationships. Our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights, or litigation or claims arising out of intellectual property matters, may harm our business. 26 Table of Contents We are regularly subject to general litigation, regulatory disputes, and government inquiries. We are regularly subject to claims, individual and class action lawsuits, government and regulatory investigations, inquiries or requests, and other proceedings involving competition and antitrust law, intellectual property, privacy, data protection, information security, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, sanctions, anti-corruption, consumer protection, accessibility claims, securities, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, services, escheatment of unclaimed or abandoned property, and other matters. In particular, our business faces ongoing consumer protection and intellectual property litigation, as discussed above. The number and significance of these disputes and inquiries have increased as our company has grown larger, our business has expanded in scope and geographic reach, and our products and services have increased in complexity. In addition, the laws, rules and regulations affecting our business, including those pertaining to Internet and mobile commerce, payments services, and credit, are subject to ongoing interpretation by the courts and governmental authorities, and the resulting uncertainty in the scope and application of these laws, rules and regulations increases the risk that we will be subject to private claims and governmental actions alleging violations of those laws, rules and regulations.The scope, outcome and impact of claims, lawsuits, government investigations, and proceedings that we are subject to cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of the outcome, such investigations and proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of management resources, reputational damage, and other factors. Determining reserves for our pending litigation and regulatory proceedings is a complex, fact-intensive process that is subject to management’s judgment. Resolving one or more such legal and regulatory proceedings could potentially require us to make substantial payments to satisfy judgments, fines or penalties or to settle claims or proceedings, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business. These proceedings could also result in reputational harm, criminal sanctions, consent decrees, or orders preventing us from offering certain products or services, requiring a change in our business practices in costly ways or development of non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies. Any of these consequences could materially and adversely affect our business.Certain of our customer agreements contain arbitration provisions with class action waiver provisions that may limit our exposure to consumer class action litigation, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in enforcing these arbitration provisions, or the class action waiver provisions in them, in the future or in any given case. Legislative, administrative or regulatory developments may directly or indirectly prohibit or limit the use of pre-dispute arbitration clauses and class action waiver provisions. Any such prohibitions or limitations on or discontinuation of the use of such arbitration or class action waiver provisions could subject us to additional lawsuits, including additional consumer class action litigation, or materially impact our ability to avoid exposure from consumer class action litigation. We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities. The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation and significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Like many other multinational corporations, we are subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Our determination of our tax liability is always subject to audit and review by applicable domestic and foreign tax authorities, and we are currently undergoing a number of investigations, audits and reviews by taxing authorities throughout the world. Any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could have a negative effect on our business and the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the periods for which such determination is made. While we have established reserves based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventualities, these reserves may prove to be insufficient.In addition, our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated, or by the incurrence of losses, in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, as a result of gains on our foreign exchange risk management program, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items.Various levels of government, such as U.S. federal and state legislatures, and international organizations, such as the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) and the EU, are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative or regulatory action to increase tax revenue. Any such tax reform or other legislative or regulatory actions could increase our effective tax rate. We and our merchants may be subject to sales reporting and record-keeping obligations. A number of U.S. states, the U.S. federal government and foreign countries have implemented or are in the process of implementing reporting or record-keeping obligations on companies that engage in or facilitate ecommerce to improve tax compliance. Additionally, a number of jurisdictions are reviewing whether payment service providers and other intermediaries could be deemed the legal agent of merchants for certain tax purposes. We have modified our software to meet known requirements and expect further modifications will be required to comply with future requirements, which may change our customer experience and increase operational costs. Any failure by us to comply with these and similar reporting and record-keeping obligations could result in substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions, impact our ability to do business in certain jurisdictions, and harm our business. 27 Table of Contents Acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic investments, and other strategic transactions could result in operating difficulties and could harm our business. Acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic investments, and other strategic transactions are important elements of our overall corporate strategy. We expect to continue to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions as part of our overall business strategy, including business combinations, acquisitions, and dispositions of certain businesses, technologies, services, products, and other assets, as well as joint ventures, strategic investments, and commercial and strategic partnerships. These transactions may involve significant challenges and risks, including:•the potential loss of key customers, vendors and other key business partners of the companies we acquire, or dispose of, following and continuing after announcement of our transaction plans;•declining employee morale and retention issues affecting employees of companies that we acquire or dispose of, which may result from changes in compensation, management, reporting relationships, future prospects, or the direction of the acquired or disposed business;•difficulty making strategic hires of new employees;•diversion of management time and a shift of focus from operating the business to the transaction, and in the case of an acquisition, integration and administration;•the need to integrate the operations, systems (including accounting, management, information, compliance, human resource and other administrative systems), technologies, products and personnel of each acquired company, which is an inherently risky and potentially lengthy and costly process;•the inefficiencies and lack of control that may result if such integration is delayed or not implemented, and unforeseen difficulties and expenditures that may arise as a result;•the need to implement or improve controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at companies that, prior to acquisition, may have lacked such controls, procedures and policies or whose controls, procedures and policies did not meet applicable legal, regulatory and other standards;•potential exposure to new or increased regulatory oversight and regulatory obligations associated with new products or entry into new markets;•risks associated with our expansion into new international markets;•risks associated with the complexity of entering into and effective managing joint ventures, strategic investments, and other strategic partnerships•lawsuits resulting from the transaction;•liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including intellectual property and other litigation claims or disputes, violations of laws, rules and regulations, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities;•the potential loss of key employees following the transaction;•the acquisition of new customer and employee personal information, which in and of itself may require regulatory approval and or additional controls, policies and procedures and subject us to additional exposure and additional complexity and costs of compliance; and•our dependence on the accounting, financial reporting, operating metrics and similar systems, controls and processes of acquired businesses and the risk that errors or irregularities in those systems, controls and processes will lead to errors in our financial statements or make it more difficult to manage the acquired business.At any given time we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more of these or other types of transactions, any of which could, individually or in the aggregate, be material to our financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying, negotiating, and consummating favorable transaction opportunities. It may take us longer than expected to fully realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions, and those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Any acquisitions or dispositions may also require us to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt (and increased interest expense), liabilities, and amortization expenses related to intangible assets or write-offs of goodwill, which could adversely affect our results of operations and dilute the economic and voting rights of our stockholders.Joint ventures and minority investment inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, thereby potentially increasing the financial, legal, operational and/or compliance risks associated with the joint venture or minority investment. In addition, we may be dependent on joint venture partners, controlling shareholders, management or other persons or entities who control them may have business interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours. Business decisions or other actions or omissions of the joint venture partners, controlling shareholders, management or other persons or entities who control them may adversely affect the value of our investment, result in litigation or regulatory action against us and otherwise damage our reputation and brand. 28 Table of Contents We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk. We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, including the following:•networks, banks, payment processors, and payment gateways that link us to the payment card and bank clearing networks to process transactions;•unaffiliated third-party lenders to make consumer and merchant loans originated in the U.S. for our PayPal Credit and PayPal Working Capital products, respectively;•third parties that provide loan servicing and customer statements processing;•third parties that provide certain outsourced customer support and product development functions, which are critical to our operations; and•third parties that provide facilities, infrastructure, components and services, including data center facilities and cloud computing.Third parties that we rely on to process transactions may fail or refuse to process transactions adequately, and these and other third parties on whom we rely may breach their agreements with us, refuse to renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms, take actions that degrade the functionality of our services, impose additional costs or requirements on us, or give preferential treatment to competitive services. Financial or regulatory issues, labor issues, or other problems that prevent these third parties from providing services to us or our customers could harm our business. If our service providers do not perform satisfactorily, our operations could be disrupted, which could result in customer dissatisfaction, damage our reputation, and harm our business. Price increases or financial penalties by, or service terminations, disruptions or interruptions at, companies that we rely on to provide services to us or our customers could disrupt our operations and harm our business. Some third parties who provide services to us may have or gain market power and be able to increase their prices to us without competitive constraint. In addition, there can be no assurance that third parties who provide services directly to us or our customers will continue to do so on acceptable terms, or at all. If any third parties were to stop providing services to us or our customers on acceptable terms, including as a result of bankruptcy or other business interruption, we may be unable to procure alternatives from other third parties in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all. Our developer platforms, which are open to merchants and third-party developers, subject us to additional risks. We provide third-party developers with access to application programming interfaces, software development kits and other tools designed to allow them to produce applications for use, with a particular focus on mobile applications. There can be no assurance that merchants or third-party developers will develop and maintain applications and services on our open platforms on a timely basis or at all, and a number of factors could cause such third-party developers to curtail or stop development for our platforms. In addition, our business is subject to many regulatory restrictions. It is possible that merchants and third-party developers who utilize our development platforms or tools could violate these regulatory restrictions and we may be held responsible for such violations, which could harm our business. Our retail point of sale solutions expose us to additional risks. We have announced several retail point of sale solutions, which enable merchants to accept payments using a payments card reader attached to, or otherwise communicating with, a mobile device or to scan payment cards and codes using the mobile device’s embedded camera, and which enable consumers to use their mobile devices to pay at the point of sale. We have entered into strategic partnerships with Visa, MasterCard and Discover to further expand our relationship with these companies in a way that will make it easier for merchants to accept and consumers to choose to pay for transactions utilizing these companies' credit and debit cards. As part of those agreements, we will gain access to each of these partner's tokenization services in the U.S. for in-store point-of-sale PayPal transactions, which we expect will increase the number of point of sale transactions that we process. As we continue to expand our product and service offerings at the retail point of sale, we will face additional risks, including:•increased expectations from offline retailers regarding the reliability and availability of our systems and services and correspondingly lower amounts of downtime, which we may not be able to meet;•significant competition at the retail point of sale, particularly from established payment card providers such as Visa, MasterCard and American Express, many of which have substantially greater resources than we do;•increased targeting by fraudsters; given that our fraud models are less developed in this area, we may experience increases in fraud and associated transaction losses as we adjust to fraudulent activity at the point of sale;•exposure to product liability claims to the extent that hardware devices that we produce for use at the retail point of sale malfunction or are not in compliance with laws, which could result in substantial liability and require product recalls or other actions;•exposure to additional laws, rules and regulations;•increased reliance on third parties involved with processing in-store payments, including independent software providers, electronic point of sale providers, hardware providers (such as cash register and pin-pad providers), payment processors and banks that enable in-store transactions; and•lower operating income than our other payment solutions.Unless we are able to successfully manage these risks, including driving adoption of, and significant volume through, our retail point of sale solutions over time, our business may be harmed. 29 Table of Contents Our success largely depends on key personnel. Because competition for our key employees is intense, we may not be able to attract, retain, and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our business. The loss of key personnel could harm our business. Our future performance depends substantially on the continued services of key personnel, including our executive team and other highly skilled employees, and our ability to attract, retain, and motivate such personnel. Competition for key personnel is intense, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area, where our corporate headquarters are located and where the cost of living is high, and we may be unable to successfully attract, integrate, or retain sufficiently qualified key personnel. In making employment decisions, particularly in the technology and payments industries, job candidates often consider the value of the equity awards they would receive in connection with their employment, and fluctuations in our stock price, or a perception that the market price of our stock may not increase or may increase more slowly than stock prices at other technology or payments companies, may make it more difficult to attract, retain, and motivate employees. We are limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws or policies. In addition, we do not have long-term employment agreements with any of our key personnel and do not maintain any “key person” life insurance policies. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel, or our inability to attract highly qualified key personnel, could harm our business. We are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our products and services. Companies providing online services may be subject to claims relating to information disseminated through them, including claims alleging defamation, libel, breach of contract, invasion of privacy, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, among other things. The laws relating to the liability of companies providing online services for information disseminated through their services are subject to frequent challenges both in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. We are also subject to potential liability to third parties for the customer-provided content on our products and services, particularly in jurisdictions outside the U.S. where the applicable laws are unsettled. If we become liable for information provided by our customers and carried on our products and services, we could be directly harmed and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability, including expending substantial resources or discontinuing certain product or service offerings, which could harm our business. Risks Related to the Separation and Our Operation as an Independent Publicly Traded Company If the distribution, together with certain related transactions, does not qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), eBay, PayPal and eBay stockholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities and, in certain circumstances, we could be required to indemnify eBay for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement. On July 17, 2015, we became an independent publicly traded company through the pro rata distribution by eBay Inc. of 100% our outstanding common stock to eBay’s stockholders (which we sometimes refer to as the “separation” or the “distribution”). eBay received an opinion from its outside legal counsel regarding the qualification of the distribution, together with certain related transactions, as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code. The opinion was based on and relied on, among other things, certain facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements and undertakings of eBay and of us, including those relating to the past and future conduct of eBay and of us. If any of these representations, statements or undertakings were, or became, inaccurate or incomplete, or if eBay or we breach any of our respective covenants in the separation documents, the opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized.Notwithstanding the opinion of counsel, the IRS could determine that the distribution, together with certain related transactions, should be treated as a taxable transaction if the IRS determines that any of these representations, assumptions, or undertakings upon which such opinion was based are incorrect or have been violated or if the IRS disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel. An opinion of counsel is not binding on the IRS or any court and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge the conclusions reached in the opinion. The IRS did not provide any opinion in advance of the separation that our proposed transaction is tax-free.If the distribution, together with certain related transactions, failed to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code, in general, eBay would recognize taxable gain as if it had sold the PayPal common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value, eBay stockholders who received PayPal common stock in the distribution may be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares and we could incur significant liabilities. 30 Table of Contents We may not be able to engage in desirable strategic or capital-raising transactions for a period of time following the separation. In addition, we could be liable for adverse tax consequences resulting from engaging in significant strategic or capital-raising transactions. To preserve the tax-free treatment to eBay of the separation and the distribution, under the tax matters agreement that we entered into with eBay, for a period of time following the distribution, we are generally prohibited from taking certain actions that prevent the distribution and related transactions from qualifying as a transaction that is generally tax-free, for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code. These restrictions may limit our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or other transactions that we or our stockholders consider desirable or may prevent us from engaging in certain capital-raising transactions. We have limited history of operating as an independent, publicly traded company in our current form, and our historical financial information is not necessarily representative of the results that we would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results. The consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K were derived in part from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of eBay and do not necessarily reflect the financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows that we would have achieved as a separate, independent, publicly traded company during the periods presented or those that we will achieve in the future, primarily as a result of the factors described below:•Prior to the separation, our business was operated by eBay as part of its broader corporate organization, rather than as an independent company. eBay or its affiliates performed various corporate functions for us, such as legal, finance, treasury, accounting, tax, auditing, human resources, certain compliance functions, and public affairs. Our historical financial results prior to separation reflect allocations of corporate expenses from eBay for such functions, which are likely to be less than the comparable expenses we would have incurred had we operated as a separate publicly traded company. In addition, we may need to significantly increase our investment in certain of these functions to ensure appropriate levels of administrative, legal and regulatory compliance.•Prior to the separation, our business was integrated with the other businesses of eBay. Historically, we shared economies of scope and scale in costs, employees, vendor relationships and customer relationships. Although we have entered into arm’s length agreements with eBay, including the operating agreement, these arrangements may not retain or fully capture the benefits that we enjoyed as a result of being integrated with eBay and may result in our paying higher charges than in the past for these services. This could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.•As a part of eBay, we benefited from, among other things, the acquisition of new customers from eBay, capital to fund acquisitions, investments and credit, and data from eBay that helped us to manage risks and maintain a low loss rate. In addition, being a part of eBay enabled us to leverage eBay’s technology capabilities, data, commerce platforms and relationships with retailers, brands and large merchants worldwide. The loss of these synergies and benefits could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.•Generally, our working capital requirements and capital for our general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and capital expenditures, were historically satisfied as part of the corporate-wide cash management policies of eBay. We may need to obtain additional financing from banks, through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities, or through strategic relationships or other arrangements, which may or may not be available and may be more costly.•The cost of capital for our business may be higher than eBay’s cost of capital prior to the separation.We may continue to experience significant changes in our cost structure, management, financing, and business operations as a result of operating as an independent company separate from eBay. For additional information, please see “Management’s 31 Table of Contents Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. eBay remains a significant source of our revenues. We continue to derive a significant amount of revenues and operating income from eBay. Our relationship with eBay is governed in part by an operating agreement that was entered into at separation and has a term of five years. When our operating agreement with eBay expires, or if it is terminated prior to its expiration, or if there is a significant change in our relationship with eBay, including if eBay becomes a merchant of record, eliminates or modifies any of its risk management or customer protection programs, directs transactions to a different provider of payment services or offers eBay customers more payment options, our business could be materially harmed. eBay may fail to perform under various agreements that were executed as part of the separation or we may fail to have necessary systems and services in place when certain of the transaction agreements expire. In connection with the separation, we entered into a separation and distribution agreement with eBay as well as various other agreements, including an operating agreement, colocation services agreements, transition services agreements, a tax matters agreement, an employee matters agreement, an intellectual property matters agreement, a data sharing addendum, and a product development agreement. The separation agreement, the tax matters agreement, the employee matters agreement, and the intellectual property matters agreement determine the allocation of assets and liabilities (including by means of licensing) between the companies following the separation for those respective areas and include any necessary indemnifications related to liabilities and obligations. The operating agreement, the colocation services agreements and the data sharing addendum establish certain commercial relationships between eBay and us related to payment processing, credit, information technology infrastructure and data sharing. The transition services agreements provide for the performance of certain services by each company for the benefit of the other for a limited period of time after the separation. If we or eBay is unable to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements, including its respective indemnification obligations, we could incur operational difficulties or losses or be required to make substantial indemnification or other payments to eBay. If we do not have in place our own systems and services, or if we do not have agreements with other providers of these services once these transaction agreements expire or terminate, we may not be able to operate our business effectively and our financial condition and result of operations may be adversely affected. After the separation, certain of our directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their previous or continuing positions at eBay. Because of their current or former positions with eBay, certain of our directors own eBay common stock and equity awards. Following the separation, even though our board of directors consists of a majority of directors who are independent, some of our directors continue to have a financial interest in eBay common stock and equity awards. In addition, one of our directors continues to serve on the eBay board of directors. Continuing ownership of eBay common stock and equity awards or service as a director at both companies could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest if we and eBay were to have disagreements about the agreements between us or face decisions that could have different implications for us and eBay. Risks Related to Our Common Stock The price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly. The price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including, but not limited to:•actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;•changes in financial estimates by us or securities analysts and recommendations by securities analysts;•changes in our capital structure;•speculation, coverage or sentiment in the media or the investment community;•the operating and stock price performance of comparable companies;•changes to the regulatory and legal environment under which we operate; and•market conditions or trends in the payments industry, the industries of merchants and the domestic and worldwide economy as a whole. 32 Table of Contents Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the state courts of the State of Delaware, or, if no state court located in the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the District of Delaware, as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could discourage lawsuits against us and our directors and officers. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that unless the corporation otherwise determines, the state courts of the State of Delaware, or, if no state court located in the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the District of Delaware, will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors or officers to us or our stockholders, any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“DGCL”) or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes with us or our directors or officers, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors and officers. Alternatively, if a court outside of Delaware were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above, we could incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may prevent or delay an acquisition of our company, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock. Certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of deterring coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and by encouraging prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others:•rules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings;•the fact that directors may not be elected, removed or replaced at stockholder-requested special meetings unless a person, entity or group owns at least a majority of our outstanding common stock;•the right of our board to issue preferred stock and to determine the voting, dividend and other rights of preferred stock without stockholder approval; and•the ability of our directors, and not stockholders, to fill vacancies on our board of directors in most circumstances and to determine the size of our board of directors;•the prohibition on stockholders acting by written consent; and•the absence of cumulative rights in the election of directors.We have also elected not to be governed by Section 203 of the DGCL, which provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that acquire, or are affiliated with a person that acquires, more than 15% of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the date on which that person or its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15% of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, however, contains a provision that generally mirrors Section 203 of the DGCL, except that it provides for a 20% threshold instead of the 15% provided for by the DGCL. These provisions could delay or prevent a change of control that our stockholders may favor.Certain of the above provisions were added pursuant to the agreement between eBay Inc. and certain entities under the control of Carl C. Icahn. These provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers. However, these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and may delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in the best interests of us and our stockholders. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors.In addition, an acquisition or further issuance of our stock (including preferred stock) could trigger the application of Section 355(e) of the Code. For a discussion of Section 355(e), see “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” in our registration statement on Form 10, as amended, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Under the tax matters agreement, in such circumstances, we would be required to indemnify eBay for any resulting taxes, which could materially and adversely affect us. Moreover, this indemnity obligation might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control that our stockholders may consider favorable. Please refer to “Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions” and “Description of PayPal’s Capital Stock” in our registration statement on Form 10, as amended, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a more detailed description of these agreements and provisions. 33 Table of Contents We own and lease various properties in the U.S. and other countries around the world.

Separation from eBay Inc. On September 30, 2014, eBay Inc. (“eBay”) announced its intent to separate its payments business into an independent, publicly traded company. To accomplish this separation, in January 2015, eBay incorporated PayPal Holdings, Inc. (“PayPal Holdings”) which is now the parent of PayPal, Inc. and holds directly or indirectly all of the assets and liabilities associated with PayPal, Inc. In June 2015, the board of directors of eBay approved the separation (the “separation”) of eBay's payments business through the distribution (the “distribution”) of 100% of the outstanding common stock of PayPal Holdings to eBay's stockholders. PayPal Holdings' registration statement on Form 10, as amended, was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on June 29, 2015. On July 17, 2015 (the “distribution date”), PayPal Holdings became an independent publicly traded company through the pro rata distribution by eBay of 100% of the outstanding common stock of PayPal Holdings to eBay stockholders. Each eBay stockholder of record as of the close of business on July 8, 2015 received one share of PayPal Holdings common stock for every share of eBay common stock held on the record date. Approximately 1.2 billion shares of PayPal Holdings common stock were distributed on July 17, 2015 to eBay stockholders. PayPal Holdings' common stock began “regular way” trading under the ticker symbol “PYPL” on The NASDAQ Stock Market on July 20, 2015.Prior to the separation, eBay transferred substantially all of the assets and liabilities and operations of eBay's payments business to PayPal Holdings, which was completed in June 2015 (the “capitalization”). The consolidated financial statements prior to the capitalization were prepared on a stand-alone basis and were derived from eBay's consolidated financial statements and accounting records. The consolidated financial statements reflect our financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income and cash flows as our business was operated as part of eBay prior to the capitalization. Following the capitalization, our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PayPal Holdings and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of dates and for periods prior to the separation may not be indicative of what our financial position, results of operations and cash flows would have been as a separate stand-alone entity during the periods presented, nor are they indicative of what our financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be in the future. For additional information, see “Note 1—Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires, references to “we,” “our,” “us,” “the Company” and “PayPal” refer to PayPal Holdings and its consolidated subsidiaries or, in the case of information as of dates or for periods prior to the separation, the consolidated entities of the payments business of eBay, including PayPal, Inc. and certain other assets and liabilities that had been historically held at the eBay corporate level but were specifically identifiable and attributable to the payments business. Business Environment We are a leading technology platform and digital payments company that enables digital and mobile payments on behalf of consumers and merchants worldwide. Our vision is to democratize financial services, as we believe that managing and moving money is a right for all people, not just the affluent. Our goal is to increase our relevance for consumers and merchants to manage and move their money anywhere in the world, anytime, on any platform and using any device. Our combined payment solutions, including our PayPal, PayPal Credit, Braintree, Venmo, Xoom, and Paydiant products, compose our proprietary Payments Platform.We operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened regulatory focus on all aspects of the payments industry. That focus continues to become even more heightened as regulators on a global basis focus on such important issues as countering terrorist financing, anti-money laundering, privacy and consumer protection. Some of the laws and regulations to which we are subject were enacted recently and the laws and regulations applicable to us, including those enacted prior to the advent of digital and mobile payments, are continuing to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation. Non-compliance with laws and regulations, increased penalties and enforcement actions related to non-compliance, changes in laws and regulations or their interpretation, and the enactment of new laws and regulations applicable to us could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Therefore, we monitor these areas closely to ensure compliant solutions for our customers who depend on us.The United Kingdom (U.K.) held a referendum on June 23, 2016 in which a majority of voters approved an exit from the European Union (EU) (“Brexit”). The outcome of this referendum caused volatility in global stock markets and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Brexit could adversely affect the U.K., European and worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to instability in regional or global financial and foreign exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the British Pound and Euro. We have foreign exchange exposure management programs designed to help reduce the impact from foreign currency rate movements. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, net revenues generated from our U.K. operations constituted 12%, 13% and 14%, respectively, of total net revenues. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, net revenues generated from the EU (excluding the U.K.) constituted approximately 20% of total net revenues. For additional information on how Brexit could affect our business, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” under the caption—“The United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union could adversely affect us.” Information security risks for global payments and technology companies have significantly increased in recent years. Although we are not aware of any material impacts relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches on our Payments Platform, there can be no assurance that we are immune to these risks and will not suffer such losses in the future. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” under the caption—“Our business is subject to cyberattacks and security and privacy breaches.” 37 Table of Contents Overview of Results of Operations The following table provides a summary of our consolidated operating results for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014: Year Ended December 31, Percent Increase/(Decrease) 2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 (In millions, except percentages and per share amounts)Net revenues$10,842 $9,248 $8,025 17 % 15 %Operating expenses9,256 7,787 6,757 19 % 15 %Operating income1,586 1,461 1,268 9 % 15 %Operating margin15% 16% 16% ** **Income tax expense230 260 842 (12)% (69)%Effective tax rate14% 17% 67% ** **Net income$1,401 $1,228 $419 14 % 193 %Net income per diluted share(1)(2)$1.15 $1.00 $0.34 15 % 192 %Net cash provided by operating activities$3,158 $2,546 $2,220 24 % 15 % All amounts in tables are rounded to the nearest millions, except as otherwise noted. As a result, certain amounts may not recalculate using the rounded amounts provided.(1) On July 17, 2015, the distribution date, eBay stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 8, 2015 received one share of PayPal common stock for every share of eBay common stock held as of the record date. Basic and diluted net income per share for the year ended December 31, 2014 was calculated using the number of common shares distributed on July 17, 2015.(2) The weighted average number of common shares outstanding for diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2015 was based on the number of common shares distributed on July 17, 2015 for the period prior to distribution and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period beginning after the distribution date. ** Not MeaningfulNet revenues increased $1.6 billion, or 17%, in 2016 and $1.2 billion, or 15%, in 2015. The increase was primarily driven by growth in TPV (as defined below under “Net Revenues”) of 26% in 2016 and 20% in 2015. Net revenues from Xoom (acquired in November 2015) contributed two percentage points to the 2016 growth rate and had no impact to the 2015 growth rate. Total operating expenses increased $1.5 billion, or 19%, in 2016 and $1 billion or 15% in 2015. The increase in 2016 was due primarily to an increase in transaction expense and transaction and loan losses and higher other operating expenses incurred to operate as an independent public company (primarily in customer support and operations, general and administrative, and depreciation and amortization), partially offset by a decrease in restructuring expense. The increase in total operating expense in 2015 was primarily due to an increase in transaction expense, transaction and loan losses, general and administrative, and customer support and operations expense. Xoom operating expenses contributed three percentage points to the 2016 growth rate and one percentage point to the 2015 growth rate. Operating income increased $125 million, or 9%, in 2016 and $193 million, or 15% in 2015. Operating income increased in 2016 and 2015 primarily due to the increase in net revenues and total operating expenses increasing less compared to the increase in net revenues from operating efficiencies. Xoom had a four percentage points negative impact to 2016 growth rates and a one percentage point negative impact to 2015 growth rates. Our operating margin was 15%, 16% and 16% in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Operating margin decreased in 2016 primarily due to growth in our transaction expense and transaction and loan losses which together increased 30% in 2016 compared to 2015. Operating margin was flat in 2015 compared to 2014. Net income increased by $173 million, or 14%, in 2016 and $809 million, or 193%, in 2015. The increase in net income in 2016 was attributable to an increase in operating income of $125 million, a decrease in income tax expense of $30 million and an increase in other income (expense), net of $18 million. The increase in net income in 2015 was attributable to an increase in operating income of $193 million and a decrease in income tax expense of $582 million primarily resulting from the recognition of deferred tax liabilities in 2014 relating to undistributed foreign earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries for 2013 and prior years. 38 Table of Contents Non-GAAP financial measures The following table provides a summary of our consolidated non-GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014: Year Ended December 31, Percent Increase/(Decrease) 2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 (In millions, except percentages and per share amounts)Non-GAAP operating income$2,174 $1,975 $1,648 10 % 20%Non-GAAP operating margin20% 21% 21% ** ** Non-GAAP income tax expense$394 $402 $298 (2)% 35%Non-GAAP net income$1,825 $1,588 $1,343 15 % 18%Non-GAAP net income per diluted share(1)(2)$1.50 $1.29 $1.10 16 % 18%Free Cash Flow$2,489 $1,824 $1,728 36 % 6% All amounts in tables are rounded to the nearest millions, except as otherwise noted.

For information on how we compute these non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, please refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Information” below. Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange Rates We have significant operations internationally that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar, subjecting us to foreign currency risk which may adversely impact our financial results. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar versus the British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar, as well as other currencies in which we conduct our international operations, impacts the translation of our net revenues and expenses generated in these foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, we generated approximately 47%, 50% and 52% of our net revenues from customers domiciled outside of the United States, respectively. During each of these periods, the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) was the only country, other than the United States, where we generated more than 10% of total net revenues in. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, net revenues generated from the EU (excluding the U.K.) constituted approximately 20% of total net revenues. Because we have generated substantial net revenues internationally in recent periods, including during the periods presented, we are subject to the risks of doing business in countries outside of the U.S. as discussed under “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition.” We calculate the year-over-year impact of foreign currency movements on our business using prior period foreign currency exchange rates applied to current period transactional currency amounts. While changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported results, we have a foreign currency exchange exposure management program whereby we designate certain foreign currency exchange contracts as cash flow hedges to help reduce the impact on earnings from foreign currency exchange rate movements. However, it is impossible to predict or eliminate the effects of this exposure. Gains and losses from these foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized as a component of transaction revenues in the same period the forecasted transactions impact earnings.In the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the year-over-year foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar had the following impact on our reported results: 39 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 (in millions)Unfavorable impact to net revenues (exclusive of hedging impact)$(196) $(527)Hedging impact119 182Unfavorable impact to net revenues (77) (345)Favorable impact to operating expense86 310Net impact to operating income$9 $(35) Additionally, in connection with our services in multiple currencies, we generally set our foreign currency exchange rates twice per day, and may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign currency exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the times that we set our foreign currency exchange rates. Given that we also have foreign currency exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries, we have an additional foreign currency exchange exposure management program whereby we use foreign currency exchange contracts to offset the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency gains and losses on our assets and liabilities are recorded in “Other income (expense), net,” which is offset by the gains and losses on the foreign currency exchange contracts. These foreign currency exchange contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. Financial Results Net revenues Revenue description We earn revenue primarily by processing customer transactions on our Payments Platform and from other value added services. Our revenues are classified into the following two categories:•Transaction revenues: Net transaction fees charged to consumers and merchants primarily based on the volume of activity, or Total Payments Volume (“TPV”), processed through our Payments Platform. We define TPV as the value of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed through our Payments Platform, excluding transactions processed through our gateway and Paydiant products. Growth in TPV is directly impacted by the number of payment transactions that we enable on our Payments Platform. Payment transactions are the total number of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed through our Payments Platform, excluding transactions processed through our gateway and Paydiant products. We earn additional fees on transactions settled in foreign currencies when we enable cross-border transactions (i.e., transactions where the merchant or consumer were in different countries).•Other value added services: Net revenues derived principally from interest and fees earned on our PayPal Credit loans receivable portfolio, subscription fees, gateway fees, gain on sale of participation interests in certain consumer loans receivable, revenue share we earn through partnerships, interest earned on certain PayPal customer account balances, fees earned through our Paydiant products and other services that we provide to consumers and merchants.Our revenues can be significantly impacted by the following:•The mix of merchants, products and services;•The mix between domestic and cross-border transactions;•Geographic region or country in which a transaction occurs; and•The amount of PayPal Credit loans receivable outstanding with consumers and merchants. 40 Table of Contents Net revenues analysis The components of our net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows: Year Ended December 31, Percent Increase/(Decrease) 2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 (In millions, except percentages)Transaction revenues$9,490 $8,128 $7,107 17% 14%Other value added services1,352 1,120 918 21% 22%Net revenues$10,842 $9,248 $8,025 17% 15% Transaction revenues Transaction revenues increased by $1.4 billion, or 17%, in 2016 compared to 2015, and by $1.0 billion, or 14%, in 2015 compared to 2014. Xoom transaction revenues contributed two percentage points to the 2016 growth rate and had no impact to the 2015 growth rate. The increase in transaction revenues in 2016 and 2015 was due primarily to the growth in TPV and in the number of payment transactions, both of which were due primarily to increased engagement from our customers (measured by payment transactions per active account) and the increase in our active customer accounts. Net gains from our foreign currency exchange contracts recognized as a component of transaction revenues in 2016 were $119 million, compared to $182 million in 2015. Refer to “Note 8—Derivative Instruments” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our foreign currency exposure management program. The following table provides a summary of our active customer accounts, number of payment transactions, TPV and related metrics: Year Ended December 31, Percent Increase/(Decrease) 2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 (In millions, except percentages)Active customer accounts(1)197 179 162 10% 11%Number of payment transactions(2)6,129 4,928 3,964 24% 24%Payment transactions per active account(3)31.1 27.5 24.5 13% 12%Total TPV(4)$354,014 $281,764 $234,635 26% 20%Percent of cross-border TPV22% 22% 24% ** ** All amounts in tables are rounded to the nearest millions, except as otherwise noted. As a result, certain amounts may not recalculate using the rounded amounts provided.1 An active customer account is a registered account that successfully sent or received at least one payment or payment reversal through our Payments Platform, excluding transactions processed through our gateway and Paydiant products, in the past 12 months.2 Payment transactions are the total number of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed through our Payments Platform, excluding transactions processed through our gateway and Paydiant products.3 Number of payment transactions per active customer account reflects the total number of payment transactions within the previous 12 month period, divided by active customer accounts at the end of the period4 Total Payment Volume or “TPV” is the value of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed through our Payments Platform, excluding transactions processed through our gateway and Paydiant products. ** Not meaningfulThe percentage growth in transaction revenues was lower than the percentage growth in TPV and payment transactions in 2016 due primarily to a higher portion of person-to-person (“P2P”) transactions (including our Venmo products) for which we earn lower rates, and a higher portion of TPV generated by large merchants who generally pay lower rates with higher transaction volume. The percentage growth in transaction revenues was lower than the percentage growth in TPV and payment transactions in 2015 due to a higher portion of TPV generated by large merchants who generally pay lower rates on higher transaction volume and a lower mix of cross-border transactions. Cross-border transactions generally provide higher revenues than similar transactions that take place within a single country or market. The percent of TPV generated by large merchants increased in 2016 and 2015. The impact of increases or decreases in prices charged to our customers did not significantly impact revenue growth in 2016 or 2015. 41 Table of Contents Other value added services Net revenues from other value added services increased by $232 million, or 21%, in 2016 compared to 2015, and by $202 million, or 22%, in 2015 compared to 2014. Growth in net revenues from other value-added services in 2016 was due primarily to interest and fee income earned on our PayPal Credit loans receivable portfolio. The total consumer and merchant loans receivable balance as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $5.7 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively, reflecting a year over year increase of 29%. The increase in net revenues from other value added services in 2015 was due primarily to interest and fee income earned on loans receivable outstanding from consumers and merchants that used our PayPal Credit products, revenue share earned under our credit program agreement with Synchrony Financial, and the gain on sale of a participation interest in certain consumer loans receivable that we purchased, as described further below.In the third quarter of 2015, we amended the terms of our credit program agreement with Synchrony Financial. As a result of the amendment, we recognized $78 million of additional revenue under the agreement during 2015. In addition, as part of the amended agreement, our obligation to purchase the portfolio of consumer loan receivables relating to the customer accounts arising out of the credit program agreement with Synchrony Financial was terminated. We retain an option to purchase the portfolio at the end of the new contract term. In the second quarter of 2015, we completed an arrangement with certain investors under which we sold participation interests in certain consumer loans and interest receivable related to our PayPal Credit products with a gross book value of approximately $708 million. As a result of the arrangement, the impact to net revenues from other value added services during 2015 was a net decrease of $35 million compared to 2014 due to the reduction in net revenues earned from interest and fees on the participation interests sold, partially offset by the gain recognized on the sale of the participation interest (inclusive of the gain of $26 million recognized on the initial sale of approximately $708 million in certain consumer loans receivable) and servicing fees. Operating Expenses Beginning with the first quarter of 2016, we reclassified certain operating expenses in our consolidated statements of income to better align our external and internal financial reporting. These classification changes relate primarily to real estate and information technology operating expenses that were previously allocated among customer support and operations expense, sales and marketing expense and product development expense. Our management no longer allocates these operating expenses for internal financial reporting purposes or general management of the business and has therefore discontinued this allocation for external financial reporting purposes. As a result, starting with the first quarter of 2016 these operating expenses were reported as part of general and administrative expenses. These changes have no impact on the previously reported consolidated net income for prior periods, including total operating expenses, financial position or cash flows for any periods presented, and do not eliminate any of the costs allocated to us by eBay for any periods prior to the separation. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. See “Note 1—Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the effects of the changes on the presentation of operating expenses to our previously reported consolidated statement of income. Growth rates presented below are calculated based upon the reclassified prior period amounts. The following table summarizes our operating expenses and related metrics we use to assess the trend in each: 42 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, Percent Increase/(Decrease) 2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 (In millions, except percentages)Transaction expense$3,346 $2,610 $2,170 28% 20 %Transaction and loan losses1,088 809 646 34% 25 %Customer support and operations1,267 1,110 991 14% 12 %Sales and marketing969 937 954 3% (2)%Product development834 792 747 5% 6 %General and administrative1,028 873 733 18% 19 %Depreciation and amortization724 608 516 19% 18 %Restructuring— 48 — ** ** Total operating expenses$9,256 $7,787 $6,757 19% 15 %Transaction expense rate10.95% 0.93% 0.92% Transaction and loan loss rate20.31% 0.29% 0.28% 1 Transaction expense rate is calculated by dividing transaction expense by TPV 2 Transaction and loan loss rate is calculated by dividing transaction and loan losses by TPV** Not Meaningful Transaction expense Transaction expense is primarily composed of the costs we incur to accept a customer’s funding source of payment. These costs include fees paid to payment processors and other financial institutions in order to draw funds from a customer’s credit or debit card, bank account or other funding source they have stored in their digital wallet. Transaction expense also includes fees paid to disbursement partners to enable a transaction and interest expense on borrowings incurred to finance our portfolio of loans receivable arising from our PayPal Credit funding option. We refer to the allocation of funding sources used by our consumers as our “funding mix.” The cost of funding a transaction with a credit or debit card is generally higher than the cost of funding a transaction from a bank or through internal sources such as a PayPal account balance or PayPal Credit. As we expand the availability of alternative funding sources to our customers, a change in funding mix can increase or decrease our transaction expense rate. For example, in connection with our customer choice initiatives, we expect that our transaction expense rate will increase. The cost of funding a transaction is also impacted by the geographic region or country in which a transaction occurs because we generally pay lower rates for transactions funded with credit cards outside the U.S. than in the U.S. Transaction expense increased $736 million, or 28%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The increases in transaction expense in 2016 was primarily attributable to an increase in TPV, which increased 26% in 2016. Transaction expense increased by $440 million, or 20%, in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase in transaction expense in 2015 was primarily attributable to an increase in TPV, offset by favorable foreign currency fluctuations due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Our transaction expense rate in 2016 increased compared to 2015 due primarily to changes in funding mix. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, approximately 2% of TPV was funded with PayPal Credit. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, approximately 45%, 45%, and 48% of TPV, respectively, was generated outside of the U.S. Our transaction expense rate in 2015 increased compared to 2014 due to higher assessments charged by payments processors and other financial institutions partially offset by cost efficiencies from our Payments Platform and a more favorable funding mix. Interest expense on borrowings incurred to finance our portfolio of loans receivable, included in transaction expense, was not material for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Transaction and loan losses Transaction losses include the expense associated with our customer protection programs, fraud, and chargebacks. Loan losses include the losses associated with our PayPal Credit loans receivable portfolio. We expect our transaction and loan losses to fluctuate depending on many factors, including TPV, macroeconomic conditions, changes to our customer protection programs, the impact of regulatory changes, and the credit quality of loans receivable arising from transactions funded with our PayPal Credit products and working capital advances to select merchant sellers. Additionally, prior to the distribution we recovered certain amounts from eBay related to customer protection programs offered on eligible eBay purchases made with PayPal. These costs included the actual amount of protection losses associated with eBay's customer protection programs that we administered and funded on behalf of eBay, which were included as a reduction of transaction and loan losses. Recoveries associated with protection losses incurred on eligible eBay purchases during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $27 million and $43 million, respectively. Following the distribution, we no longer administer eBay's customer protection programs or recover amounts from eBay associated with protection losses incurred on eligible eBay purchases; instead, we and eBay each independently administer our own customer protection programs. Further, our customer protection programs extend to customers’ eligible purchases on eBay and therefore we have incurred and expect to continue to incur incremental costs associated with our customer protection programs following the distribution.The components of our transaction and loan losses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows: 43 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, Percent Increase/(Decrease) 2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 (In millions, except percentages)Transaction losses$655 $511 $408 28% 25%Loan losses433 298 238 45% 25%Transaction and loan losses$1,088 $809 $646 34% 25% Transaction and loan losses increased $279 million, or 34%, in 2016 compared to 2015, and increased $163 million, or 25%, in 2015 compared to 2014. Transaction losses increased by $144 million, or 28%, in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily attributable to higher TPV. Our transaction loss rate, calculated by dividing transaction loss by TPV, in 2016 was flat compared to 2015. The growth in transaction losses in 2016 was higher than the growth in TPV in 2016 due primarily to lower incremental costs in 2015 associated with our customer protection programs following the distribution. Transaction losses increased by $103 million, or 25%, in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily attributable to higher TPV. Our transaction loss rate in 2015 increased compared to 2014 due to lower recoveries in 2015 associated with transaction losses incurred on eligible eBay purchases offset by improved consumer loss performance and a higher provision in the prior year from actual losses incurred. Loan losses increased $135 million, or 45%, in 2016 compared to 2015 and increased $60 million, or 25%, in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase in loan losses in 2016 was due primarily to an increase in the loans receivable balance year over year and additional reserves recorded in the current period due to increases to forecasted principal balance delinquency rates. The total consumer loans receivable balance as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $5.1 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively, reflecting a year over year increase of 28%. The increase in loan losses in 2015 was due primarily to an increase in the loans receivable balance year over year. The total consumer loans receivable balance as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $4.0 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively, reflecting a year over year increase of 8% in 2015, including the sale of additional participation interests to certain investors in the second quarter of 2015. The increase in consumer loans receivables in 2016 and 2015 was due to the growth in the portfolio of loans receivable outstanding arising from consumers who chose PayPal Credit as a funding option and an increase in working capital advances to selected merchant sellers. The following table provides information regarding the credit quality of our pool of consumer loans and interest receivable balance: December 31, 2016 2015Weighted average U.S. consumer FICO scores(1)682 686Percentage of loans receivable with FICO scores > 680(1)52.1% 53.6%Percentage of loans receivable with FICO scores < 599(1)11.1% 9.4%Percent of loans and interest receivable current90.0% 90.1%Percent of loans and interest receivable > 90 days(3)4.1% 3.9%Net charge off rate(2)6.4% 5.9% (1) Excludes certain outstanding consumer loans outside of the U.S., for which no FICO scores are available, with an outstanding balance of $117 million and $70 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. (2) Net charge off rate is the annual ratio of net credit losses on consumer loans receivables as a percentage of the average daily amount of consumer loans and interest receivables balance during the year. (3) Represents percentage of balances which are 90 days past the billing date to the consumer.We offer credit products to certain existing small and medium-sized merchants through our PayPal Working Capital product. The total PayPal Working Capital advances and fees receivable (“merchant receivables”) outstanding as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were $558 million and $421 million, respectively, reflecting a year over year increase of 33% due to the increase in the availability of our credit products domestically and internationally. To assess a merchant seeking a PayPal Working Capital advance, we use, among other indicators, a risk model that we have internally developed that we refer to as our PayPal Working Capital Risk Model (“PRM”), as a credit quality indicator to help predict the merchant's ability to repay the principal balance and fixed fee related to the working capital advance. The PRM uses multiple variables as predictors of the merchant's ability to repay a working capital advance. Primary drivers of the model include the merchant's annual payment volume and payment processing history with PayPal, prior repayment history with the PayPal Working Capital product, and other measures. Merchants are assigned a PRM credit score within the range of 350 to 750. We generally expect that merchants to which we extend a working capital advance will have PRM scores greater than 525. We generally consider scores above 610 to be very good and to pose less credit risk. We assess a participating merchant’s PRM score on a recurring basis. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the weighted average PRM score related to our PayPal Working Capital balances outstanding was 625 and 630, respectively.The determination of the number of days our merchant receivables are outstanding is based on the current expected repayment period of the advance and fixed fee as compared to the original expected repayment period. We generally calculate the repayment rate based on the merchant's estimated future payment volume so that repayment of the advance and fixed fee is expected to occur within 9 to 12 months from the date of the advance. On a regular basis, we recalculate the repayment period based on the repayment activity on the receivable. As such, actual repayment periods are dependent on actual payment processing volumes. We monitor receivables with repayment periods greater than the original expected repayment period. In the second quarter of 2016, we refined our estimate of the original expected repayment period to take into account the variability in repayment patterns. Prior period amounts have been updated to reflect this change. The following table provides information regarding the credit quality of our merchant receivables: 44 Table of Contents December 31, 2016 2015Percentage of merchant receivables with PRM scores > 61067.7% 69.1%Percentage of merchant receivables with PRM scores < 52512.9% 10.7%Percent of merchant receivables within original expected repayment period(1)82.8% 87.2%Percent of merchant receivables > 90 days outstanding(1)7.5% 4.0% (1) Amounts in the prior periods were updated to reflect changes in our estimate of the original expected repayment period.The changes in percentage of merchant receivables past their expected repayment period at December 31, 2016 over December 31, 2015 were due primarily to the increase in longer duration merchant loans in 2016 compared to the prior year, which increased the seasonality of repayments trends. Modifications to the acceptable risk parameters of our PayPal Credit products for the periods presented did not have a material impact on our loans. Customer support and operations Customer support and operations expenses include costs incurred to provide 24-hour call support to our customers, our site operations and other infrastructure costs incurred to support our Payments Platform, costs to support our trust and security programs protecting our merchants and consumers and other costs incurred in our operations centers. Customer support and operations costs increased $157 million, or 14%, in 2016 compared to 2015 and $119 million, or 12%, in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase in 2016 was due primarily to an increase in contractor and employee related expenses to service the growth in our active customer accounts and the number of payment transactions occurring on our Payments Platform. The increase in 2015 was predominantly related to an increase in headcount to service the growth in our active customer accounts and the number of payment transactions occurring on our Payments Platform and an increase in expenses to operate as an independent public company offset in part by favorable foreign currency fluctuations due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Sales and marketing Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of customer acquisition, business development, advertising, marketing programs, and employee compensation and contractor costs to support these programs. Sales and marketing expenses increased $32 million, or 3%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in 2016 was due primarily to higher marketing spend related to Xoom on advertising campaigns intended to enhance our global brand recognition. Sales and marketing expense decreased by $17 million, or 2%, in 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease in 2015 was due primarily to a decrease in employee and contractor related expenses and favorable foreign currency fluctuations due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, offset in part by higher marketing spend. 45 Table of Contents Product development Product development expenses consist primarily of employee compensation and contractor costs that are incurred in connection with the development of our Payments Platform, new products and the improvement of our existing products. Product development expenses exclude software and website development costs that are capitalized. The amortization of developed technology is included in depreciation and amortization expense.Product development expenses increased $42 million, or 5%, in 2016 compared to 2015 and increased $45 million, or 6%, in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase in 2016 was due primarily to an increase in employee related expenses, driven primarily by Xoom, offset by a decrease in contractor related expenses. The increase in 2015 was due primarily to investments in our Payments Platform, creating new mobile experiences for our customers and supporting our strategic initiatives, partially offset by a decrease in employee and contractor related expenses. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs incurred to provide support to our business, including legal, human resources, finance, executive and other support operations. Our legal expenses, including those related to ongoing legal proceedings, case settlements and judgments, and regulatory proceedings and fines, may fluctuate substantially from period to period.For periods prior to the separation, our consolidated financial statements include expenses associated with workplace resources and information technology that were previously allocated to the Payments segment of eBay, and additional expenses related to certain corporate functions, including senior management, legal, human resources and finance. These expenses also include allocations related to stock-based compensation. The expenses that were incurred by eBay have been allocated to us based on direct usage or benefit where identifiable, with the remainder allocated on a pro rata basis of revenue, headcount, or other systematic measure. The corporate costs and allocation of expenses from eBay may not be indicative of the expenses that may have been incurred had we been a separate stand-alone entity during the periods presented, nor are the results stated herein indicative of the expenses we may incur in the future. Such expenses could be higher or lower. In the periods presented, a significant portion of expenses associated with these functions and allocated to us in our consolidated financial statements are included in general and administrative expenses.General and administrative expenses increased $155 million, or 18%, in 2016 compared to 2015 and increased $140 million, or 19%, in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase in 2016 was due primarily to an increase in employee expenses, contractor related expenses incurred to operate as an independent public company and continued investments in compliance programs. The increase in 2015 was due primarily to an increase in expenses incurred to operate as an independent public company and an increase in expenses associated with professional services, including contractor related expenses, and regulatory matters. In 2015, $121 million of corporate costs and expenses allocated to us by eBay were included in general and administrative expenses compared to $207 million in 2014, representing a decrease of $86 million, or 42%, compared to 2014. Depreciation and Amortization The primary components of our depreciation and amortization expenses include the depreciation and amortization of software, including the amortization of capitalized software and website development costs, amortization of equipment used to deliver our services and the amortization of acquired intangible assets. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $116 million, or 19%, in 2016 compared to 2015 and increased $92 million, or 18%, in 2015 compared to 2014. The increases in 2016 and 2015 were due primarily to additional depreciation expenses associated with investments in our technology platform and in 2015, an increase in capital expenditures to operate as an independent public company. Amortization expense for intangible assets was $150 million, $93 million and $84 million in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in amortization of intangibles in 2016 and 2015 was due primarily to our acquisitions. 46 Table of Contents Restructuring In January 2015, at a regular meeting of eBay’s board of directors (the “eBay Board”), the eBay Board approved a plan to implement a strategic reduction of its existing global workforce. The reduction was completed by the end of 2015 primarily impacting sales and marketing and product development expenses. Restructuring expenses were $48 million in 2015. No restructuring expenses were recognized in 2016 or 2014. Income Tax Expense Our effective tax rate was 14% in 2016, 17% in 2015, and 67% in 2014. The decrease in our effective tax rate in 2016 was primarily due to favorable discrete tax adjustments during the year ended December 31, 2016 and other separation-related costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in our effective tax rate during 2015 compared to 2014 was due primarily to the recognition in 2014 of a U.S. deferred tax liability of approximately $650 million on $1.9 billion of undistributed foreign earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries for 2013 and prior years. See “Note 16—Income Taxes” to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on our effective tax rate. Non-GAAP Financial Information Non-GAAP financial information is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s performance that excludes or includes amounts that are different than the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation S-K, portions of this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” include a reconciliation of certain non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our related financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP.We present non-GAAP financial measures to enhance an investor’s evaluation of our ongoing operating results and to facilitate meaningful comparison of our results between periods. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to, among other things, evaluate our ongoing operations, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation.We exclude the following items from non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted share, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP effective tax rate, and non-GAAP income tax expense: •Stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes. This consists of expenses for equity awards under our equity incentive plans. We exclude stock-based compensation expense from our non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses that management does not believe are reflective of ongoing operating results. The related employer payroll taxes are dependent on our stock price and the timing and size of exercises and vesting of equity awards, over which management has limited to no control, and as such management does not believe it correlates to the operation of our business.•Amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets, impairment of goodwill and transaction expenses from the acquisition or disposal of a business. We incur amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill in connection with acquisitions and may incur significant gains or losses or transactional expenses from the acquisition or disposal of a business and therefore exclude these amounts from our non-GAAP measures. We exclude these items because management does not believe they are reflective of our ongoing operating results.•Separation. These are significant expenses related to the separation of our business from eBay into a separate, independent publicly traded company. These consist primarily of third-party consulting fees, legal fees, employee retention payments and other expenses incurred to complete the separation. We exclude these items because management does not believe they are reflective of our ongoing operating results.•Restructuring. These consist of significant expenses for employee severance and other exit and disposal costs. We exclude restructuring charges primarily because management does not believe they are reflective of ongoing operating results.•Other certain significant gains, losses, or charges that are not indicative of our core operating results. These are significant gains, losses, or charges during a period that are the result of isolated events or transactions which have not occurred frequently in the past and are not expected to occur regularly in the future. We exclude these amounts from our non-GAAP results because management does not believe they are indicative of our ongoing operating results. •Tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments. This amount is used to present stock-based compensation and the other amounts described above on an after-tax basis consistent with the presentation of non-GAAP net income. The following table provides reconciliations of our consolidated non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014: 47 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 (In millions, except percentages)GAAP operating income$1,586 $1,461 $1,268Stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes455 356 309Amortization of acquired intangible assets133 85 70Separation— 15 —Restructuring— 48 1Acquisition related transaction expense— 10 —Total non-GAAP operating income adjustments588 514 380Non-GAAP operating income$2,174 $1,975 $1,648Non-GAAP operating margin20% 21% 21% Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 (In millions, except percentages)GAAP income before income taxes$1,631 $1,488 $1,261GAAP income tax expense230 260 842GAAP net income1,401 1,228 419Non-GAAP adjustments to net income: Non-GAAP operating income adjustments (see table above)$588 $514 $380Amortization of investments— — 4Other certain significant gains, losses, or charges— — 646Separation (other income and expense)— (12) —Tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments(164) (142) (106)Non-GAAP net income$1,825 $1,588 $1,343 GAAP income tax expense$230 $260 $842Tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments164 142 106Non-GAAP income tax expense$394 $402 $948 GAAP net income per diluted share$1.15 $1.00 $0.34Non-GAAP net income per diluted share$1.50 $1.29 $1.10Shares used in GAAP diluted share calculation(1)(2)1,218 1,229 1,224Shares used in non-GAAP diluted share calculation(1)(2)1,218 1,229 1,224 GAAP effective tax rate14% 17% 67 %Tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments to net income4% 3% (49)%Non-GAAP effective tax rate18% 20% 18 % 1 On July 17, 2015, the distribution date, eBay stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 8, 2015 received one share of PayPal common stock for every share of eBay common stock held as of the record date. Basic and diluted net income per share for the year ended December 31, 2014 was calculated using the number of common shares distributed on the distribution date.2 The weighted average number of common shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2015 was based on the number of common shares distributed on July 17, 2015 for the period prior to distribution and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period beginning after the distribution date. In addition to the non-GAAP measures discussed above, we also use free cash flow to assess our operating performance. Free cash flow represents cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. We consider free cash flow to be a key performance measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases of property and equipment and including investments in our Payments Platform, which can then be used to, among other things, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions, and return cash to shareholders. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period. 48 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 (In millions)Net cash provided by operating activities$3,158 $2,546 $2,220Less: Purchases of property and equipment(669) (722) (492)Free cash flow$2,489 $1,824 $1,728 Liquidity and Capital Resources We require liquidity and access to capital to fund our global operations, including customer protection programs, our PayPal Credit products, capital expenditures, investments in our business, potential acquisitions, working capital and other cash needs. The following table summarizes the cash, cash equivalents and investment balances available as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015: Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 (In millions)Cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investment securities(1)(2)$6,447 $5,707(1)Excludes assets related to customer accounts of $14.4 billion and $12.3 billion at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.(2) Excludes total restricted cash of $17 million and $26 million at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and cost method investments of $50 million and $26 million as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.Cash, cash equivalents and investments held by our foreign subsidiaries (i.e., any entities where earnings would be subject to United States tax upon repatriation) were $5.0 billion as of December 31, 2016 and $4.2 billion at December 31, 2015, or 78% and 74% of our total cash, cash equivalents and investments as of those dates, respectively. In the second quarter of 2015, we received a contribution of approximately $3.8 billion of cash from eBay, as well as a related estimated deferred tax liability of $236 million associated with foreign earnings that are not considered indefinitely reinvested. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we reassessed the measurement of the deferred tax liability based on updated valuation information and reduced the deferred tax liability balance to $172 million as of December 31, 2015. The adjustment to the deferred tax liability was recorded as a contribution from eBay and resulted in an increase to net parent investment within stockholders' equity. This cash is being used for general corporate purposes in both our international and domestic operations.In the third quarter of 2015, we entered into a credit agreement (“Credit Agreement”) that provides for an unsecured $2.0 billion, five-year revolving credit facility that includes a $150 million letter of credit sub-facility and a $150 million swingline sub-facility, with available borrowings under the revolving credit facility reduced by the amount of any letters of credit and swingline borrowings outstanding. Borrowings and other amounts payable under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by PayPal, Inc. (the “Guarantor”). We may also, subject to the agreement of the applicable lenders, increase the commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to $500 million. Subject to specified conditions, we may designate one or more of our subsidiaries as additional borrowers under the Credit Agreement provided that we and the Guarantor guarantee all borrowings and other obligations of any such subsidiaries under the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2016, no subsidiaries were designated as additional borrowers. Funds borrowed under the Credit Agreement may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes.Loans under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at either (i) the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a margin (based on our public debt ratings) ranging from 1.00 percent to 1.625 percent or (ii) a formula based on the agent bank’s prime rate, the federal funds effective rate or LIBOR plus a margin (based on our public debt ratings) ranging from zero percent to 0.625 percent. Subject to certain conditions stated in the Credit Agreement, we and any of our subsidiaries designated as additional borrowers may borrow, prepay and re-borrow amounts under the revolving credit facility at any time during the term of the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement will terminate and all amounts owing thereunder will be due and payable on July 17, 2020, unless (a) the commitments are terminated earlier, either at our request or, if an event of default occurs, by the lenders (or automatically in the case of certain bankruptcy-related events), or (b) the maturity date is extended upon our request, subject to the agreement of the lenders. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants, events of default and indemnification provisions in favor of the banks. The negative covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens, subject to certain exceptions. The financial covenants require us to meet a quarterly financial test with respect to a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio, based on our public debt ratings. As of December 31, 2016, no borrowings or letters of credit were outstanding under the Credit Agreement. Accordingly, at December 31, 2016, $2.0 billion of borrowing capacity was available for the purposes permitted by the Credit Agreement, subject to customary conditions to borrowing.We have a cash pooling arrangement with a financial institution for cash management purposes. The arrangement allows for cash withdrawals from the financial institution based upon our aggregate operating cash balances held within the financial institution (“Aggregate Cash Deposits”). The arrangement also allows us to withdraw amounts exceeding the Aggregate Cash Deposits up to an agreed-upon limit. The net balance of the withdrawals and the Aggregate Cash Deposits are used by the financial institution as a basis for calculating our net interest expense or income under these arrangements. As of December 31, 2016, we had a total of $2.0 billion in cash withdrawals offsetting our $2.0 billion in Aggregate Cash Deposits held within the financial institution under the cash pooling arrangement.As of December 31, 2016, we were rated investment grade by Standard and Poor's Financial Services, LLC and Fitch Ratings, Inc. We expect that these credit rating agencies will continue to monitor our performance, including our capital structure and results of operations. Our goal is to be rated investment grade, but as circumstances change there are factors that could result in our credit ratings being downgraded or put on a watch list for possible downgrading. If that were to occur, it could increase our borrowing costs, including the interest rate on loans under our Credit Agreement. The risk of losses from our customer protection programs are specific to individual customers, merchants and transactions, and may also be impacted by regional variations in the programs and modifications to the programs resulting from changes to regulatory requirements. For the periods presented in these consolidated financial statements included in this report, our transaction loss rates, calculated by dividing transaction loss by TPV, ranged between 0.17% and 0.18% of TPV. Historical trends may not be an indication of future results. In addition, prior to the distribution, we recovered certain amounts from eBay related to customer protection programs offered on eligible eBay purchases made with PayPal. These costs included the actual amount of protection losses associated with eBay's customer protection programs that we administered and funded on behalf of eBay, which are included as a reduction of transaction and loan losses. Following the distribution, we no longer administer eBay's customer protection programs or recover amounts from eBay associated with transaction losses incurred on eligible eBay purchases; instead, we and eBay each independently administer our own customer protection programs. Further, our customer protection programs extend to customers’ eligible purchases on eBay and therefore we have incurred and expect to continue to incur incremental costs associated with our customer protection programs following the distribution.Growth in our portfolio of loan receivables originated through PayPal Credit products increases our liquidity needs and any failure to meet those liquidity needs could adversely affect our business. We continue to evaluate partnerships and third-party sources of funding of our credit portfolio, including, but not limited to, commercial banks, securitization markets, private equity firms and sovereign wealth funds. Consistent with this strategy, in March 2016, as approved by management and our Luxembourg banking subsidiary Supervisory Board and as permitted within regulations set forth by the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (the “CSSF”), we designated $800 million of European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary to be used to extend credit to our European customers. These funds are classified as cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheet and represent approximately 20% of European customer balances potentially available for corporate use by us at December 31, 2016 as determined by applying financial regulations maintained by the CSSF. We may periodically seek to designate additional amounts of customer balances to be used to extend credit to our European customers, if necessary, based on utilization of the approved funds and anticipated credit funding requirements. Our objective is to expand the availability of our credit products with capital from external sources, although there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving that goal. In January 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program that provides for the repurchase of up to $2 billion of our common stock, with no expiration from the date of authorization. This stock repurchase program is intended to offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and, subject to market conditions and other factors, may also be used to make opportunistic repurchases of our common stock to reduce outstanding share count. Any share repurchases under our stock repurchase program may be made through open market transactions, block trades, privately negotiated transactions or other means at times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate and will be funded from our working capital or other financing alternatives. However, any stock repurchases are subject to market conditions and other uncertainties and we cannot predict if or when any stock repurchases will be made. Moreover, we may terminate our stock repurchase program at any time without notice. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we repurchased approximately $995 million of our common stock under our stock repurchase program. As of December 31, 2016, a total of approximately $1.0 billion remained available for future repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase program.Our liquidity, access to capital and borrowing costs could be adversely impacted by declines in our credit rating, our financial performance, and global credit market conditions, as well as a broad range of other factors. In addition, our liquidity, access to capital and borrowing costs could also be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. See “Risk Factors—Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition” and “Note 12—Commitments and Contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion of these and other risks facing our business.We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, available-for-sale investments, cash expected to be generated from operations, and our expected access to capital markets, together with potential external funding through third-party sources, such as commercial banks, private equity firms, and sovereign wealth funds, will be sufficient to fund our operating activities, anticipated capital expenditures, and PayPal Credit products for the foreseeable future. 49 Table of Contents 50 Table of Contents Cash Flows In March 2016, we designated $800 million of European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary to be used to extend credit to our European customers. We have presented changes in funds receivable and customer accounts as cash flows from investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows based on the nature of the activity underlying our customer accounts which includes purchases of investments, maturities and sales of investments and changes in funds receivable and customer accounts. We have elected to conform the prior period statement of cash flows to the current period presentation to enhance transparency and provide comparability. See “Note 1—Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the effects of the changes on the presentation of our statement of cash flows to our previously reported consolidated statement of cash flows. Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 (In millions)Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities$3,158 $2,546 $2,220Investing activities(4,999) (8,038) (2,881)Financing activities2,038 4,728 1,284Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents— (44) (26)Net increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$197 $(808) $597 Operating Activities Cash flows from operating activities includes net income adjusted for certain non-cash expenses, timing differences between expenses recognized for provision for transaction and loan losses and actual transaction losses paid, and changes in other assets and liabilities. Significant non-cash expenses for the period include depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and deferred tax expenses. The cash impact from actual transaction losses paid during a period are reflected as a negative impact to changes in other current and non-current assets in cash from operating activities. The expenses recognized during the period for provision for loan losses are estimates of probable incurred losses on our PayPal Credit products for which the receivable has not been charged off. Actual charge offs of receivables related to our PayPal Credit products are reflected as a reduction in changes in principal loans receivable impacting investing activities and thus have no impact on cash from operating activities.We generated cash from operating activities of $3.2 billion in 2016 due primarily to operating income of approximately $1.6 billion. Adjustments for non-cash expenses of depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation (including excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation) were approximately $1.1 billion during 2016. Adjustments for non-cash expenses related to provision for transaction and loan losses were approximately $1.1 billion during 2016. The cash generated from operating activities was negatively impacted by changes in working capital primarily related to transaction loss allowance for cash losses, net. We generated cash from operating activities of $2.5 billion in 2015 due primarily to operating income of approximately $1.5 billion. Adjustments for non-cash expenses of depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation (including excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation) were approximately $928 million during 2015. Adjustments for non-cash expenses related to transaction and loan losses were approximately $809 million during 2015. The cash generated from operating activities was negatively impacted by changes in working capital primarily related to actual transaction losses paid during the period. Additional uses of cash impacting cash generated from operating activities include net cash outflows relating to settlement of eBay payables and receivables of approximately $96 million and increases in accounts receivable of approximately $22 million.We generated cash from operating activities of $2.2 billion in 2014 due primarily to operating income of approximately $1.3 billion. Adjustments for non-cash expenses of depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation (including excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation) were approximately $774 million. Adjustments to non-cash expenses for transaction and loan losses were $646 million. The cash generated from operating activities was offset by uses of cash primarily related to transaction loss allowance for cash losses, net and changes in other working capital.Cash paid for income taxes in 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $48 million, $216 million and $47 million, respectively. 51 Table of Contents Investing Activities The net cash used in investing activities of $5 billion in 2016 was due primarily to purchases of available for sale investments of $21.0 billion, increases in our loan receivable portfolio (net of collections) originated through our PayPal Credit products of $1.5 billion, purchases of property and equipment of $669 million and net increases in funds receivable from customers and customer accounts of $176 million, including the reclassification of $800 million of European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary as cash and cash equivalents. These net cash outflows were offset by maturities and sales of investments of $18.4 billion. The net cash used in investing activities of $8 billion in 2015 was due primarily to purchases of investments of $21.6 billion, acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $1.2 billion, increases in our loan receivable portfolio (net of collections) originated through our PayPal Credit products of $819 million and purchases of property and equipment of $722 million. These net cash outflows were offset in part by maturities and sales of investments of $16.1 billion and net cash inflows relating to receivables from eBay of $575 million. The net cash used in investing activities of $2.9 billion in 2014 was due primarily to purchases of available for sale investments of $8.7 billion, increases in our loan receivable portfolio (net of collections) originated through our PayPal Credit products of $1 billion, purchases of property and equipment of $492 million and net cash outflows relating to receivables from eBay of $362 million. These net cash outflows were offset in part by maturities and sales of investments of $7.8 billion. Financing Activities The net cash provided by financing activities of $2 billion in 2016 was due primarily to increases in funds payable and amounts due to customers of $3 billion, offset in part by the repurchase of $995 million of our common stock under our stock repurchase program.The net cash provided by financing activities of $4.7 billion in 2015 was due primarily to a contribution of approximately $3.9 billion of cash from eBay and increases in funds payable and amounts due to customers of $1.6 billion, offset in part by repayments of borrowings from eBay of $862 million. The net cash provided by financing activities of $1.3 billion in 2014 was due primarily to increases in funds payable and amounts due to customers of $1.3 billion, offset in part by repayments of borrowings from eBay. Free Cash Flow We define free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. Free cash flow was $2.5 billion in 2016, an increase of $665 million from 2015. The increase in free cash flow during the period was primarily due to higher cash generated from operating activities of $612 million and lower purchases of property and equipment of $53 million. Free cash flow generated during 2016 was used for funding our credit portfolio, repurchasing our common stock under our stock repurchase program, and general business purposes. Free cash flow was $1.8 billion in 2015, an increase of $96 million from 2014. The increase in free cash flow during the period was primarily due to higher cash generated from operating activities of $326 million, offset in part by higher purchases of property and equipment of $230 million. Free cash flow generated during 2015 was used towards our acquisitions completed in 2015, funding our credit portfolio and general business purposes.Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. See “Non-GAAP Financial Information” for information on how we compute free cash flow and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. 52 Table of Contents Effect of Exchange Rates on Cash Currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on cash and cash equivalents in 2016. The negative effect of currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents during 2015 and 2014 of $44 million and $26 million, respectively, was due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against certain foreign currencies, primarily the Euro. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Future Liquidity and Obligations As of December 31, 2016, approximately $28.8 billion of unused credit was available to PayPal Credit account holders compared to $24.8 billion of unused credit as of December 31, 2015. While this amount represents the total unused credit available, we have not experienced, and do not anticipate, that all of our PayPal Credit account holders will access their entire available credit at any given point in time. In addition, the individual lines of credit that make up this unused credit are subject to periodic review and termination by the chartered financial institution that is the issuer of PayPal Credit products based on, among other things, account usage and customer creditworthiness. When a consumer funds a purchase in the U.S. using a PayPal Credit product issued by a chartered financial institution, the chartered financial institution extends credit to the consumer, funds the extension of credit at the point of sale and advances funds to the merchant. We subsequently purchase the receivables related to the consumer loans extended by the chartered financial institution and, as a result of such purchase, bear the risk of loss in the event of loan defaults. Although the chartered financial institution continues to own each customer account, we own the related receivable (excluding participation interests sold) and are responsible for all servicing functions related to the account.We have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments for general operating purposes. Changes in our business needs, contractual cancellation provisions, fluctuating interest rates, and other factors may result in actual payments differing from the estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of these payments. The following table summarizes our obligations as of December 31, 2016 that are expected to impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods. We believe we will be able to fund these obligations through our existing cash and investment portfolio and cash expected to be generated from operations. PurchaseObligations OperatingLeases TotalPayments Due During the Year Ending December 31,(In millions)2017$321 $102 $4232018129 106 235201997 93 190202059 63 12220214 47 51Thereafter22 141 163 $632 $552 $1,184 The significant assumptions used in our determination of amounts presented in the above table are as follows:•Purchase obligation amounts include minimum purchase commitments for advertising, capital expenditures (computer equipment, software applications, engineering development services, construction contracts) and other goods and services entered into in the ordinary course of business.•Lease amounts include minimum rental payments under our non-cancelable operating leases for office facilities, as well as computer and office equipment that we utilize under lease arrangements. The amounts presented are consistent with contractual terms and are not expected to differ significantly from actual results under our existing leases, unless a substantial change in our headcount needs requires us to expand our occupied space or exit an office facility early.As we are unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits, net, the table does not include $244 million of such non-current liabilities included in deferred and other tax liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016. 53 Table of Contents Seasonality The Company does not experience meaningful seasonality with respect to net revenues. No individual quarter in 2016, 2015 or 2014 accounted for more than 30% of annual net revenue. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The application of U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect our reported financial condition. We have established detailed policies and control procedures to provide reasonable assurance that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period. The accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to our financial statements. An accounting estimate is considered critical if both (a) the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (b) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to our financial condition. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Our significant accounting policies, including recent accounting pronouncements, are described in “Note 1—Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the consolidated annual financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.A quantitative sensitivity analysis is provided where that information is reasonably available, can be reliably estimated and provides material information to investors. The amounts used to assess sensitivity are included to allow users of this report to understand a general direction cause and effect of changes in the estimates and do not represent management’s predictions of variability. For all of these estimates, it should be noted that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted, and estimates require regular review and adjustment. Transaction and loan losses Transaction and loan losses include the expense associated with our customer protection programs, fraud, chargebacks, and credit losses associated with our loans receivable balances. We expect our transaction and loan losses to fluctuate depending on many factors, including: total TPV, macroeconomic conditions, changes to our customer protection programs, the impact of regulatory changes, and the credit quality of loans receivable arising from transactions funded with our PayPal Credit products and working capital advances to selected merchant sellers.We establish allowances for estimated transaction losses arising from processing customer transactions, such as chargebacks for unauthorized credit card use and merchant-related chargebacks due to non-delivery of goods or services, ACH returns, buyer protection program claims, account takeovers, and account overdrafts. Additions to the allowance, in the form of provisions, are reflected in transaction and loan losses in our consolidated statements of income. The allowances are monitored regularly and are updated based on actual claims data reported by our claims processors and other actual data received. The allowances are based on known facts and circumstances, internal factors including experience with similar cases, historical trends involving loss payment patterns, and the mix of transaction and loss types.We also establish an allowance for loans receivable which represents our estimate of probable incurred loan losses inherent in our consumer loans receivable and merchant working capital advances. Increases to the allowance for loans receivable are reflected as transaction and loan losses in our consolidated financial statements. This evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates and judgments. For our consumer loans receivable, the allowance is primarily based on forecasted principal balance delinquency rates (“roll rates”). Roll rates are the percentage of balances which we estimate will migrate from one stage of delinquency to the next based on our historical experience, as well as external factors such as estimated bankruptcies and levels of unemployment. Roll rates are applied to the principal amount of our consumer receivables for each stage of delinquency, from current to 180 days past the payment due date, in order to estimate the principal loans which have incurred losses and are probable to be charged off. For merchant working capital advances, the allowance is primarily based on principal balances, forecasted delinquency rates and recoveries through the use of a vintage-based loss forecasting model.The determination of delinquency, from current to 180 days past due, for principal balances related to merchant working capital advances is based on the current expected repayment period of the advance and fixed fee as compared to the original expected repayment period. We calculate the repayment rate based on the merchant's expected future payment volume such that repayment of the advance and fixed fee is typically expected to occur within 9 to 12 months from the date of the advance. On a regular basis, we recalculate the repayment period based on the actual repayment activity on the receivable. As such, actual repayment periods are dependent on actual payment processing volumes. The allowance for loss against the interest receivable is primarily determined by applying historical average customer account roll rates to the interest receivable balance in each stage of delinquency to project the value of accounts that have incurred losses and are probable to be charged off. The allowance for fees receivable is primarily based on fee balances, forecasted delinquency rates and recoveries through the use of a vintage-based loss forecasting model. Increases to the allowance for interest receivable is reflected as a reduction of net revenues in our consolidated statement of income. Increases to the allowance for fees receivable is recognized as a reduction in deferred revenues in our consolidated balance sheet. We charge off consumer loan receivable balances in the month in which a customer balance becomes 180 days past the payment due date. We charge off the merchant receivable when the updated repayment period is 180 days past the original expected repayment period and the merchant has not made a payment in the last 60 days. We also charge off the receivable when the updated repayment period is 360 days past the original expected repayment period regardless of whether or not the merchant has made a payment within the last 60 days. Bankrupt accounts are charged off within 60 days of receiving notification from the bankruptcy courts. Loans receivable past the payment due date continue to accrue interest until such time as they are charged off, with the portion of the reserve related to the interest receivable balance classified as a reduction of revenue.Determining appropriate allowances for these losses is an inherently uncertain process and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates. We regularly update our allowance estimates as new facts become known and events occur that may impact the settlement or recovery of losses. The allowances are maintained at a level we deem appropriate to adequately provide for losses incurred at the balance sheet date. Based on our results for the year ended December 31, 2016, an aggregate ten percent increase in our transaction and loan loss rate would negatively impact transaction and loan losses by approximately $109 million. 54 Table of Contents Accounting for Income Taxes Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective government taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. Our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rates that apply to our foreign earnings. In addition to local country tax laws and regulations, our income tax rate depends on the extent that our earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management’s judgment about and intentions concerning our future operations. To the extent we do not intend to repatriate these earnings to fund U.S. operations, we do not provide for U.S. federal income and foreign withholding tax on these earnings.Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates that are based on a number of factors, including our historical experience and short range and long-range business forecasts. To the extent deferred tax assets are not expected to be realized, we record a valuation allowance.We recognize and measure uncertain tax positions in accordance with GAAP, pursuant to which we only recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. GAAP further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings in the quarter in which such change occurs. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.We file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions around the world. A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited by the relevant tax authorities and finally resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our reserves for income taxes are adequate such that we reflect the benefits more likely than not to be sustained in an examination. We adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest, where appropriate in light of changing facts and circumstances. Settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash.Based on our results for the year ended December 31, 2016, a one-percentage point increase in our effective tax rate would have resulted in an increase in our income tax expense of approximately $16 million. 55 Table of Contents Loss Contingencies We are currently involved in various claims, legal proceedings and investigations of potential operating violations by regulatory oversight authorities. We regularly review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim, legal proceeding or potential regulatory violation is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims, litigation or other violation and may revise our estimates. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes. Revenue Recognition Application of the various accounting principles in U.S. GAAP related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires us to make judgments and estimates. Complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting. Specifically, the determination of whether we are a principal to a transaction (gross revenue) or an agent (net revenue) can require considerable judgment. Further, we provide incentive payments to consumers and merchants, which require judgment to determine whether the payments should be recorded as a reduction to gross revenue. Changes in judgments with respect to these assumptions and estimates could impact the amount of revenue recognized. Valuation of Goodwill and Intangibles The valuation of assets acquired in a business combination and asset impairment reviews require the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to estimate the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in an acquired business to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill. Impairment testing for assets, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, requires the allocation of cash flows to those assets or group of assets and if required, an estimate of fair value for the assets or group of assets. Our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. These valuations require the use of management’s assumptions, which would not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur.We evaluate goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or sooner if indicators of impairment exist. Under the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) guidance, the evaluation of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment allows for a qualitative assessment to be performed, which is similar to the FASB guidance for evaluating goodwill for impairment. In performing these qualitative assessments, we consider relevant events and conditions, including but not limited to: macroeconomic trends, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance, cost factors, company-specific events, legal and regulatory factors and our market capitalization. If the qualitative assessments indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than their carrying amounts, we must perform a quantitative impairment test.Under the quantitative impairment test, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset, an impairment loss is recorded in the statement of income. Measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit is based on one or more of the following fair value measures: amounts at which the unit as a whole could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties, using present value techniques of estimated future cash flows, or using valuation techniques based on multiples of earnings or revenue, or a similar performance measure. 56 Table of Contents Market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity price risk. Management establishes and oversees the implementation of policies governing our investing, funding, and foreign currency derivative activities in order to mitigate market risks. We monitor risk exposures on an ongoing basis. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to interest rate risk relating to our investment portfolio and from interest-rate sensitive assets underlying the customer balances we hold on our consolidated balance sheet as customer accounts. We seek to reduce earnings volatility that may result from changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, approximately 25% and 24%, respectively, of our total cash and investment portfolio was held in cash and cash equivalents. The assets underlying the customer balances we hold on our consolidated balance sheet as customer accounts are maintained in interest and non-interest bearing bank deposits, time deposits, and U.S. and foreign government and agency securities. We classify the assets underlying the customer balances as current based on their purpose and availability to fulfill our direct obligation under amounts due to customers. We seek to preserve principal while holding eligible liquid assets, as defined by applicable regulatory requirements and commercial law in jurisdictions where we operate, equal to at least 100% of the aggregate amount of all customer balances. We do not pay interest on amounts due to customers.In the third quarter of 2015, we entered into a $2 billion senior unsecured credit facility maturing in 2020. Borrowings under the revolving facility, if any, bear interest at floating rates. As a result, we will be exposed to fluctuations in interest rates to the extent of our borrowings under the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2016, no borrowings or letters of credit were outstanding under the Credit Agreement. Interest rates may also adversely impact our customers’ spending levels and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amounts owed to us. Higher interest rates often lead to higher payment obligations by customers to us and other lenders under mortgage, credit card and other consumer loan obligations, which may reduce our customers’ ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore may lead to increased delinquencies, charge-offs and allowances for loan and interest receivable, which could have an adverse effect on our net earnings. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would not have had a material impact on our financial assets or liabilities at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Foreign Currency Risk We have significant operations internationally that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar, subjecting us to foreign currency risk which may adversely impact our financial results. We transact business in various foreign currencies and have significant international revenues as well as costs. In addition, we charge our international subsidiaries for their use of intellectual property and technology and for certain corporate services. Our cash flow, results of operations and certain of our intercompany balances that are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses due to foreign currency fluctuations and related hedging activities. We are generally a net receiver of foreign currencies and therefore benefit from a weakening of the U.S. dollar, and are adversely affected by a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, relative to foreign currencies.We have a foreign exchange exposure management program designed to identify material foreign currency exposures, manage these exposures and reduce the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated cash flows and results of operations through foreign currency exchange contracts. These foreign currency exchange contracts are accounted for as derivative instruments; for additional details related to our foreign currency exchange contracts, please see “Note 8—Derivative Instruments” to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We use foreign exchange forward contracts to protect our forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These hedging contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movements. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. The effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) and subsequently reclassified into revenue in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the unrealized gains and losses on these contracts, if any, is recorded immediately in earnings. We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that changes in exchange rates of 20% for all currencies could be experienced in the near term. If the U.S. dollar weakened by 20% at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign currency exchange forward contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately $341 million and $321 million lower, respectively. If the U.S. dollar strengthened by 20% at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign currency exchange forward contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately $341 million and $321 million higher, respectively.We have an additional foreign exchange management program whereby we use foreign currency exchange contracts to offset the foreign currency exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency gains and losses on our assets and liabilities are recorded in “Other income (expense), net,” which is offset by the gains and losses on the foreign currency exchange contracts.Adverse changes in exchange rates of 20% for all currencies would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately $160 million and $136 million at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, without considering the offsetting effect of hedging. Foreign currency exchange contracts in place as of December 31, 2016 would have positively impacted income before income taxes by approximately $128 million, resulting in a net negative impact of approximately $32 million. Foreign currency exchange contracts in place as of December 31, 2015 would have positively impacted income before income taxes by approximately $133 million, resulting in a net negative impact of approximately $3 million. These reasonably possible adverse changes in currency exchange rates of 20% were applied to total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of our subsidiaries at the balance sheet dates to compute the adverse impact these changes would have had on our income before income taxes as of these dates. 57 Table of Contents Equity Price Risk As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our cost method investments totaled $50 million and $26 million, respectively, which represented less than 1% of our total cash and investment portfolio and were primarily related to cost method investments in privately held companies. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we did not hold any marketable equity instruments. We review our investments for impairment when events and circumstances indicate a decline in fair value of such assets below carrying value is other-than-temporary. Our analysis includes a review of recent operating results and trends, recent sales and acquisitions of the securities in which we have invested and other publicly available data. European Debt Exposures We actively monitor our exposure to the European markets, including the impact of sovereign debt issues associated with Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain. As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we did not have any direct investments in the sovereign debt of these countries or in debt securities issued by corporations or financial institutions organized in these countries. We maintain a small number of operating bank accounts with local and foreign banks in the aforementioned countries that have balances that we do not consider material.",
    "key_insights": "PayPal operates a powerful two-sided proprietary platform connecting millions of consumers and merchants globally, demonstrating massive scale with 197 million active customer accounts and $354 billion in Total Payment Volume (TPV) processed in 2016. The core strategy is centered on growing its customer base, expanding its global capabilities, and forming strategic partnerships to reinforce its role in the global digital payments ecosystem.

    "context": "Overview PayPal Holdings, Inc. (“we,” “our,” “us,” “the Company” or “PayPal”) is a leading technology platform company that enables digital and mobile payments on behalf of consumers and merchants worldwide. We believe in providing simple, affordable, secure and reliable financial services and digital payments to help our customers around the world to achieve their financial goals. We strive to increase our relevance for consumers, merchants, friends and family to access and move their money anywhere in the world, anytime, on any platform and through any device (e.g., mobile, tablets, personal computers or wearables). We provide safer and simpler ways for businesses of all sizes to accept payments from merchant websites, mobile devices and applications, and at offline retail locations through a wide range of payment solutions. We also facilitate person to person payments through PayPal, Venmo and Xoom (acquired in November 2015). Our combined payment solution capabilities, including our PayPal, PayPal Credit, Braintree, Venmo, and Xoom products, comprise our proprietary Payments Platform. The terms \"we,\" \"our,\" \"us,\" \"the Company,\" and \"PayPal\" mean PayPal Holdings, Inc. and, unless otherwise expressly stated or the context requires, its subsidiaries.We enable global commerce by providing payment solutions for our approximately 179 million active customer accounts in over 200 markets as of December 31, 2015, while providing customers a choice of how they would like to pay or get paid. A market is a geographic area or political jurisdiction, such as a country, territory, or protectorate, in which we offer our services. A country, territory or protectorate is identified by a distinct set of laws and regulations. An active customer account is a registered account that successfully sent or received at least one payment or payment reversal through our Payments Platform, excluding transactions processed through our gateway and Paydiant products, in the past 12 months. Our gateway products include our Payflow Payments and certain Braintree products. A payment gateway links a merchant’s website to that merchant’s processing network and merchant account.We offer our customers the flexibility to use their account to both purchase and be paid for goods, as well as transfer and withdraw funds. A consumer can typically fund a purchase using a bank account, a PayPal account balance, a PayPal Credit account, a credit or debit card or other stored value products such as coupons and gift cards. Our PayPal, Venmo, and Xoom products also make it safer and simpler for friends and family to transfer funds to each other, including cross border transfers using several of these funding sources. We offer merchants an end-to-end payments solution that provides authorization and settlement capabilities, as well as instant access to funds. We help merchants connect with their customers and manage risk. PayPal's aim is to create deeper, more relevant relationships with each of its customers. We measure the relevance of our products in the lives of our customers, and therefore the success of our business, through both payment volume and payment transactions. Payment volume is the value of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed through our Payments Platform, excluding transactions processed through our gateway and Paydiant products (“Total Payment Volume” or “TPV”). During 2015, our TPV was approximately $282 billion, representing growth of 20% over 2014. “Payment transactions” is the total number of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed through our Payments Platform, excluding transactions processed through our gateway and Paydiant products. During 2015, we processed approximately 4.9 billion payment transactions, representing growth of 24% over 2014. This translated to 27.5 payment transactions per active customer account in 2015. This is an increase from 24.5 payment transactions per active customer account in 2014. \"Payment transactions per active customer account\" reflects the total number of payment transactions within the previous 12 month period, divided by active customer accounts at the end of the period. 1 Table of Contents Our Payments Platform is built to make the existing global financial infrastructure work for people in the digital and mobile age. PayPal allows people to make seamless transactions between different markets and networks. Our Payments Platform connects with financial institutions around the world and allows consumers to make purchases using a broad range of payment methods, regardless of where a merchant is located. Consumers who use our Payments Platform can engage in cross-border shopping by sending payments in more than 200 markets across the globe and in more than 100 currencies. This enables merchants to extend their reach across borders to an expanded customer base.We generate revenues by charging fees for providing transaction processing and other payment-related services, primarily based on the volume of activity, or TPV, processed through our Payments Platform. We also earn revenue by providing value added services to consumers and merchants, such as our PayPal Credit and Paydiant products. During 2015, we generated revenue of $9.2 billion, representing growth of 15% over 2014 (19% on an foreign currency neutral basis). Our revenue is influenced by, among other things, consumer spending patterns, merchant adoption of payment methods other than traditional credit or debit cards and cash, the expansion of multi-channel retail, the growth of mobile devices and merchant applications on those devices, the growth of consumers with access to the Internet globally, the pace of transition from paper-based forms of payment to digital forms of payment, our share of the digital payments market, and our ability to innovate new methods of payment that merchants and consumers find to be valuable. Our strategy is to drive growth by:•Growing our core businesses globally through expanding our capabilities and base of active customer accounts, increasing our customers’ use of our products and services by better addressing our customers’ everyday needs in managing and moving money and expanding the adoption of our solutions by new merchants and consumers;•Expanding our value proposition for customers by providing risk management, insights from our two-sided Payments Platform, and scale;•Extending our existing business by seeking new areas of growth in markets around the world and focusing on innovation both in the digital and the physical world; and •Enhancing our strong foundation focused on trust, simplicity, and being technology agnostic. 2 Table of Contents In line with our strategy to drive growth, we focus on the generation of free cash flow. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as cash flow from operations less purchases of property and equipment. We consider free cash flow to be a key performance measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of operating cash flow generated by the business after the purchases of property and equipment, which can then be used to, among other things, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions, and return cash to shareholders. In 2015, we generated $1.8 billion in free cash flow; this represents an increase of $96 million from 2014. Please refer to Part II, Item 7 \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Non-GAAP Financial Information\" for information on how we compute free cash flow and a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.PayPal is a popular form of payment for mobile commerce, and our business has grown with the increased adoption of mobile devices. We believe that our Braintree products strengthen our position in mobile payments and extend our coverage to a new class of retailers who offer their services primarily through mobile applications. These products have expanded our footprint with earlier stage merchants. Our Venmo app is a leading mobile application to move money between friends and family using their mobile device. With Venmo, we have a diversified demographic of consumers. In April 2015, we completed our acquisition of Paydiant to further expand our capabilities in mobile payments. Using Paydiant’s platform, our merchant partners can create their own branded wallets to accelerate mobile-in-store payments and drive consumer engagement through mobile payments, loyalty, offers and the prioritization of preferred payment types, such as store branded credit cards and gift cards. In November 2015, we completed our acquisition of Xoom. Xoom enables consumers to send money, pay bills and send mobile phone reloads to family and friends around the world using mobile devices. We believe that mobile devices are the bridge between online, in-app, and in-store offerings, creating a pathway to a larger addressable market. In addition, mobile becomes a conduit that facilitates the movement and management of money, including remittances, consumer lending, and person-to-person (\"P2P\") transactions. We operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened regulatory focus on all aspects of the payments industry. That focus continues to become even more heightened as regulators on a global basis focus on such important issues as countering terrorist financing, anti-money laundering, privacy and consumer protection. Some of the laws and regulations to which we are subject were enacted recently and the laws and regulations applicable to us, including those enacted prior to the advent of digital and mobile payments, are continuing to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation. Non-compliance with laws and regulations, increased penalties and enforcement actions related to non-compliance, changes in laws and regulations or their interpretation, and the enactment of new laws and regulations applicable to us could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Therefore, we monitor these areas closely to ensure compliant solutions for our customers who depend on us. 3 Table of Contents Connecting Merchants and Consumers We operate a proprietary global technology platform that links merchants and consumers around the globe to facilitate the processing of payment transactions, allowing us to connect millions of merchants and consumers worldwide. Our Payments Platform facilitates an efficient and secure means for merchants to receive payments, and a convenient, secure way for consumers to make payments. We process transactions through our Payments Platform in more than 200 markets, allowing customers to pay and get paid in more than 100 currencies, withdraw funds to their bank accounts in 57 currencies and hold balances in their PayPal accounts in 26 currencies.A transaction on our Payments Platform can involve up to three participants in addition to us: a merchant, a consumer and the consumer’s funding source provider. The following diagram illustrates a typical payment transaction between a consumer and a merchant on our Payments Platform: Consumers We enable consumers to more safely exchange funds with merchants using their PayPal digital wallet. Our digital wallet provides consumers with the ability to draw funds from a variety of their financial resources, which may include both “internal” sources of funds (i.e., a PayPal account balance or PayPal Credit account) and sources of funds that are “external” to PayPal (e.g., bank transfers, credit and debit cards or gift cards), within one application. We generally do not charge consumers to fund or draw from their accounts; however, we generate revenue from consumers on fees charged to exchange currencies and on interest and fees from consumer loans originated through our PayPal Credit products.We value our relationship with our consumers and invest in this relationship. We strive to provide efficient customer service, account support, and protection from loss, and to create relevant products. As of December 31, 2015, over 8,000 people in our customer service organization worked to provide our consumers with answers and solutions when and where they need them, in over 20 languages. We have operations centers around the world, including in the U.S., Europe, Asia and South America, that strive to provide high-quality service and support for our customers. We have also developed a number of trust and security programs, including PayPal’s Buyer Protection Program, that provide additional protection to consumers for qualifying purchases by reimbursing the consumer for the full amount of the purchase if a purchased item does not arrive or is significantly different than the seller’s description (see \"Revenue Sources—Protecting Merchants and Consumers\" below).Traditional financial institutions often charge fees for basic services provided to their customers, and existing alternatives to these financial institutions, including services to cash a check or pay a bill, can be inconvenient and expensive. We focus on providing affordable consumer products that democratize the access to and movement of money. We believe that managing and moving a consumer’s money should be a right, not a privilege. Through our technology and products, we believe we can change the status quo and make digital payments more efficient and accessible. We expect P2P transfers to contribute to this strategy. We believe that our P2P products have network effects and help to establish relationships with potential PayPal users by allowing them to join the Payments Platform at the time of making or receiving payments, which encourages our natural, customer-driven growth. PayPal offers P2P payment solutions through its website, its PayPal mobile application, through Venmo, a mobile application that enables payment transactions between non-merchant account holders, and through Xoom, a service enabling payments from customers in the United States to family and friends in a secure, fast and cost-effective way, using their mobile phones or computers. Xoom offers money transfer services from the United States to 41 countries, cross-border bill payment services from the United States to 7 countries and prepaid mobile phone reload services in 25 countries.We also provide the ability for consumers to receive a line of credit through our PayPal Credit consumer products. Consumers access this credit through their PayPal account or directly with merchants. As of December 31, 2015, we have purchased or extended approximately $7.4 billion in credit to consumers, of which $4.0 billion is currently outstanding. We currently fund the purchase of PayPal Credit consumer receivables with international and domestic cash resources. Our chartered financial institution in Luxembourg, or an independent chartered financial institution in the U.S. with whom we partner, extends credit to the consumer, funds the extension of credit at the point of sale (“POS”) and advances funds to the merchant. In the U.S., we subsequently purchase the consumer receivables related to the consumer loans from the independent chartered financial institution with whom we partnered and as a result of that purchase, bear the risk of loss on the related consumer receivables, less a participation interest held by the independent chartered financial institution. As we expand the availability of our credit products, we expect to utilize capital from internal and external sources. In the second quarter of 2015, we concluded an arrangement with certain investors whereby we sold a participation interest in certain consumer receivables originated by PayPal Credit. We will continue to evaluate partnerships and third party sources of funding of our credit portfolio, including, but not limited to, commercial banks, securitization markets, private equity firms, sovereign wealth funds and under certain specific circumstances, the use of customer funds. For additional information concerning our consumer credit products, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -Future Liquidity and Obligations” and “Note 9—Loans and Interest Receivable Net” to our combined and consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein. 4 Table of Contents Merchants As commerce continues to transition from the physical world to the digital world and from domestic commerce to global commerce, our proprietary Payments Platform provides opportunities for merchants to grow their businesses. We partner with merchants to help them grow and expand their businesses by improving sales conversion, providing global reach, offering alternative payment methods (such as easy integration credit products and mobile capabilities), reducing losses through proprietary protection programs, and leveraging data analytics. We focus on growing merchant acceptance through business development activities and direct relationships with merchants. We enable merchants to more safely and simply receive payments from our active customer accounts, providing global reach while reducing some of the complexity and friction involved in enabling overseas and cross-border trade. For the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately 45% of our TPV involved a merchant outside of the U.S., and approximately 22% was cross-border (i.e., transactions where the merchant or consumer were in different countries).A merchant can typically open a standard PayPal account and begin accepting payments through PayPal within a few minutes. Most online or mobile merchants can onboard quickly and are not required to invest in new or specialized hardware. Our Payments Platform supports growth with a variety of value added services designed to help businesses of all sizes manage their cash flow, invoice clients, pay bills, and reduce the need for merchants to receive and store sensitive customer financial information. For our standard service, we do not charge merchants setup or recurring fees. A merchant can also integrate with Braintree to begin accepting payments with credit or debit cards, PayPal, Venmo, digital currencies such as Bitcoin, or other payment solutions with a single integration.Our payment and PayPal Credit products are designed to help merchants increase the conversion rate of consumer purchases on their websites and mobile applications. For example, our One Touch product allows consumers to authenticate their account during their first One Touch purchase. This enables them to skip the login process for future payments and turn shopping into a one touch operation with near-instant authentication. With a faster authentication process, we believe that fewer customers will abandon a potential transaction before completing it. We also provide the ability for merchants to offer (and consumers to fund) payments via a deferred payment option using our PayPal Credit consumer products. In addition, our PayPal Working Capital (“PPWC”) product provides merchants with a working capital advance, which is paid back to PayPal through a percentage of a merchant’s sales that PayPal processes. In 2015, we achieved the milestone of having originated more than $1 billion in working capital advances. As of December 31, 2015, we had $421 million PayPal Working Capital advances and fees receivable outstanding. Our PPWC product allows us to deepen our engagement with our small business customers by offering them additional services. For additional information concerning our merchant credit products, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -Future Liquidity and Obligations” and “Note 9—Loans and Interest Receivable, Net” to our combined and consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We value our relationship with merchants and invest in this relationship by providing customer service, account support, developer advocacy and support, and proprietary risk and security solutions. In addition to our consumer protection programs, we have also developed PayPal’s Seller Protection Program. This program provides protection to merchants against claims that a transaction was not authorized by the buyer or claims that an item was not received by covering the seller for the full amount of the payment on eligible sales. By offering dual buyer and seller protection programs, both the consumer and merchant can transact with confidence.Our Payments Platform and open application programming interfaces (“APIs”) are designed to allow developers to innovate with ease and to offer cutting edge applications to a large ecosystem of merchants and consumers, while at the same time maintaining the security of our customers’ financial information. We provide developers with easy to use, flexible and powerful tools that are designed to leverage our global reach and payment capabilities. Our software developer kits (“SDKs”) are specifically focused on the mobile application market and are designed to remove friction by not requiring a redirect to the PayPal website or an additional log-in. We are using a true “mobile first” approach to make payments simple and intuitive. 5 Table of Contents Competition The global payments industry is highly competitive. We compete against businesses in varied industries, many of which are larger than we are, have a dominant and secure position in other industries, or offer other goods and services to consumers and merchants which we do not offer. We compete against all forms of payments, including credit and debit cards; automated clearing house and bank transfers; other online payment services; mobile payments; and offline payment methods, including cash and check. We compete primarily on the basis of the following:•ability to attract, retain and engage both merchants and consumers;•ability to show that merchants will achieve incremental sales by offering our PayPal services;•security of transactions and the ability for consumers to use our PayPal products and services without sharing their financial information with the merchant or the party they are paying;•simplicity of our fee structure;•ability to develop services across multiple commerce channels, including mobile payments and payments at the retail point of sale;•trust in our dispute resolution and buyer and seller protection programs;•customer service;•brand recognition;•website, mobile platform and application onboarding, ease-of-use and accessibility;•system reliability and data security;•ease and quality of integration into third-party mobile applications and operating systems; and•quality of developer tools such as our application programming interfaces and software development kits.For additional information concerning competition and our competitors, see Item 1A: “Risk Factors- Substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry may harm our business.”PayPal seeks to differentiate itself from industry participants on the safety of the transaction (our risk management capabilities as well as protection of consumer account details), the simplicity provided for digital transactions, and being both brand and technology agnostic. Further, unlike traditional four-party networks or other mobile payment solutions, PayPal has a direct financial relationship with both its consumers and merchants. As a result of our risk management capabilities, PayPal can provide its customers with protection from fraud and other losses incurred by participants to a transaction.To compete effectively, we will need to continue to expend significant resources in technology and marketing. During 2015, PayPal incurred $947 million on product innovation and development and enhancing our infrastructure to ensure our customers have the capabilities they need and want to complete transactions safely and simply. Further, in 2015, we incurred over $900 million related to our efforts to promote our brands through advertising, promotions, and other strategic initiatives. Our marketing efforts play an important role in building brand visibility, usage and overall preference among consumers at checkout. Our strengths Our business is built on a strong foundation designed to allow PayPal to differentiate itself from our competitors and drive growth. 6 Table of Contents Our competitive capabilities include: •Two-sided Platform - our platform connecting merchants and consumers enables PayPal to offer unique end-to-end product experiences while gaining valuable insights into customer behavior through our data. Our platform provides for simple digital and mobile transactions (use of an email address, a mobile phone number, or our One Touch product) while being both brand and technology agnostic. •Risk Management - our risk management system and tokenization allows us to keep our customers safer and to process legitimate transactions around the world while preventing illegal, high-risk, or fraudulent transactions. •Brand -PayPal has built a well-recognized and trusted brand and was named one of Interbrand’s best global brands of 2015.•Scale - our global scale gives us impressive reach. As of December 31, 2015, we had 179 million active customer accounts which included 13 million merchants, and in 2015, PayPal processed $282 billion of total payment volume in more than 200 markets around the world.•Regulatory Capability - we believe that our regulatory licenses that give us the ability to operate in markets around the world are a clear advantage and help our business grow.•Financial Strength - the diversity of our funding mix gives us confidence we can continue to grow profitably. Our strong balance sheet, low debt and cash balance allow us to aggressively pursue new opportunities.In addition to the discussion in this section, see “Substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry may harm our business” in “Item 1A: Risk Factors” below for further discussion of the potential impact of competition on our business. Revenue Sources We earn revenues primarily by processing customer transactions on our Payments Platform and from other value added services. Our revenues are classified into the following two categories:•Transaction revenues: Net transaction fees charged to consumers and merchants based on the volume of activity processed through our Payments Platform, including our PayPal, PayPal Credit, Venmo, Braintree and Xoom products. •Other value added services: Net revenues derived principally from interest and fees earned on our PayPal Credit loans receivable portfolio, subscription fees, gateway fees, gain on sale of participation interest in certain consumer loans receivable, revenue share we earn through partnerships, interest earned on certain PayPal customer account balances, fees earned through our Paydiant products and other services that we provide to consumers and merchants.Transaction revenues are generated from fees charged to consumers and merchants on the TPV that we enable. Growth in TPV is also directly impacted by the number of active customer accounts and the payment transactions that we enable on our payments platform. In 2015, transaction revenues generated from customers and merchants on eBay’s marketplace who completed a transaction using our products constituted 26% of our net revenues, down from 29% in 2014. The decline in percentage of revenues generated from eBay buyers and eBay sellers reflects the growth in adoption of PayPal solutions on platforms other than eBay. No other source of revenue represented more than 10% of our revenues.Our pricing varies among regions and can be modified for individual merchants through customer-specific agreements which provide merchants with financial incentives and other benefits to issue, accept, route, prioritize and promote our branded products and other payment programs. These financial incentives may be based on TPV or other performance-based criteria, such as issuance of new payment products, increased acceptance of our products, launch of new programs, or execution of marketing initiatives. 7 Table of Contents Protecting Merchants and Consumers Protecting merchants and consumers from loss is imperative to successfully competing in the payments industry. Trust and security are essential for our customers, and PayPal invests significantly in providing both merchants and consumers with comprehensive protection. The risk to merchants and consumers (and their payments partners) from fraudulent activities, such as account takeover, identity theft and counterparty malicious intent, is growing. Our ability to protect both consumers and merchants is based largely on our ability to leverage the data we collect on transactions and our analytical capabilities. We believe mobile devices will play an important part in the future of commerce, creating the opportunities to make our ecosystem safer. For example, PayPal is able to use location data from mobile devices and growing protection for the mobile operating environment to reduce risk to merchants and consumers.We enable consumers to make payments safely and simply without sharing sensitive financial information, such as credit card or debit card numbers, with merchants or other consumers. To make payments using PayPal, consumers need to disclose only their email address or mobile phone number to merchants. The account-based nature of our Payments Platform helps us to better detect and prevent fraud when funds enter, flow through and exit the Payments Platform because our transactions are tokenized and because payment authorization credentials are separated from account holder information. Our ongoing investment in systems and processes designed to enhance the safety and security of our products reflects our goal of having PayPal recognized as one of the world’s most trusted payments brands.We provide merchants and consumers with protection programs on substantially all transactions completed through our Payments Platform, except for transactions using our gateway and Paydiant products. These programs protect both merchants and consumers from loss primarily due to fraud and counterparty non-performance. Our risk management capabilities allow us to provide these protections, which are generally much broader than those protections provided by other participants in the payments industry. Most payments providers do not offer merchant protection in general, and those that do so generally do not provide protection of online or card not present transactions. As a result, merchants may incur losses for chargebacks and other claims on certain transactions when using other payments providers that they would not incur if they had used PayPal’s payments services. PayPal also provides consumer protection against losses on qualifying purchases and accepts claims for 180 days post transaction in the markets that PayPal serves. This protection is generally consistent with, or better than, that offered by other payments providers. We believe that as a result of these programs, consumers can be confident that they will only be required to pay if they receive the product in the condition as described, and merchants can be confident that they will receive payment for the product that they are delivering to the customer.Our Payments Platform utilizes a combination of proprietary technologies and services as well as technologies and services provided by third parties. We have developed intuitive user interfaces, customer tools and transaction processing, database and network applications that help enable our users to reliably and securely complete transactions on our sites and help our customers to utilize our suite of services. Our technology infrastructure simplifies the storage and processing of large amounts of data, eases the deployment and operation of large-scale global products and services, and automates much of the administration of large-scale clusters of computers. Our technology infrastructure has been designed around industry-standard architectures to reduce downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences. We strive to continually improve our technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and to increase efficiency, scalability, and security.Our Payments Platform’s architecture enables us to connect parties regardless of whether the transaction is occurring at a traditional physical location, online, or through a mobile device. The Payments Platform incorporates multiple layers of protection, both for continuity purposes and to help address cyber-security challenges. We engage in multiple efforts to protect the Payments Platform against these challenges, including regularly testing our systems to address potential vulnerabilities. 8 Table of Contents Intellectual Property The protection of our intellectual property, including our trademarks (particularly those covering the PayPal name), patents, copyrights, domain names, trade dress and trade secrets is critical to our success. We aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on applicable laws and regulations in the U.S. and internationally, as well as a variety of administrative procedures. We also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights in products and services. We have routinely entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors and nondisclosure agreements with parties with whom we conduct business to control access to and limit disclosure of our proprietary information.We pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and internationally. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain aspects of our proprietary technology. Effective trademark, copyright, patent, domain name, trade dress and trade secret protection is very expensive to maintain and may require litigation and may not be effective in preventing third parties from infringing upon our intellectual property rights. We must protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights in an increasing number of jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and time consuming and may not be successful.We have registered our core brands as trademarks and domain names in the U.S. and a large number of other jurisdictions and have in place an active program to continue to secure trademarks and domain names that correspond to our brands in markets of interest. Government Regulation Government regulation impacts key aspects of our business. We are subject to regulations that affect the payments industry in the markets we operate.Payments Regulation. Various laws and regulations govern the payments industry in the U.S. and globally. In the U.S., several of our subsidiaries hold licenses to operate as a money transmitter (or its equivalent), which, among other things, subjects those subsidiaries to reporting requirements, bonding requirements, limitations on the investment of customer funds and inspection by state regulatory agencies. Outside the U.S., we provide localized versions of our service to customers through various foreign subsidiaries. The activities of those non-U.S. entities are, or may, be supervised by a financial regulatory authority in the jurisdictions in which they operate. Among other regulatory authorities, the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (the “CSSF”), the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Reserve Bank of India, and the Central Bank of Russia have asserted jurisdiction over some or all of our activities in a particular country. This list is not exhaustive, as there are numerous other regulatory agencies that have or may assert jurisdiction. The laws and regulations applicable to the payments industry in any given jurisdiction are subject to interpretation and change.Banking Agency Supervision. We serve our customers in the European Union through PayPal (Europe) S.à.r.l. et Cie, SCA, a wholly-owned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a bank in Luxembourg by the CSSF. Consequently, we must comply with rules and regulations of the banking industry, including those related to capitalization, funds management, corporate governance, anti-money laundering, disclosure, reporting and inspection. We also are, or may be, subject to banking-related regulations in other countries now or in the future related to our role in the financial industry. In addition, based on our relationships with our partner financial institutions in the U.S., we are subject to indirect regulation and examination by these financial institutions’ regulators.Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) has significant authority to regulate consumer financial products in the United States, including consumer credit, deposit, payment, and similar products. The CFPB and other similar regulatory agencies in other jurisdictions may have broad consumer protection mandates that could result in the promulgation and interpretation of rules and regulations that may affect our business.Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Terrorist Financing. PayPal is subject to anti-money laundering (“AML”) laws and regulations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions outside of the U.S., as well as laws designed to prevent the use of the financial systems to facilitate terrorist activities. We have implemented a comprehensive AML program designed to prevent our payment network from being used to facilitate money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit activity, or to do business in countries or with persons and entities included on designated country or person lists promulgated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls (“OFAC”) and equivalent authorities in other countries. Our AML compliance program is comprised of policies, procedures and internal controls, including the designation of a compliance officer, and is designed to address these legal and regulatory requirements and assist in managing money laundering and terrorist financing risks.Interchange Fees. Interchange fees associated with four-party payments systems are being reviewed or challenged in various jurisdictions. For example, in the European Union, the Multilateral Interchange Fee (“MIF”) Regulation (which became effective in December 2015) caps credit and debit interchange fees for cards payments and provides for business rules to be complied with by any company dealing with card transactions, including PayPal. As a result, the fees that we collect in certain jurisdictions may become the subject of regulatory challenge.Data Protection and Information Security. Aspects of our operations or business are subject to privacy and data protection regulation in the United States, the European Union and elsewhere. For example, in the United States, we are subject to information safeguarding requirements under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act that require the maintenance of a written, comprehensive information security program and in Europe, the operations of our Luxembourg bank are subject to information safeguarding requirements under the Luxembourg Banking Act, among other laws. Regulatory authorities around the world are considering numerous legislative and regulatory proposals concerning privacy and data protection. In addition, the interpretation and application of these privacy and data protection laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in a state of flux.Anti-Corruption. PayPal is subject to applicable anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, in the jurisdictions in which it operates. Anti-corruption laws generally prohibit offering, promising, giving, or authorizing others to give anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a government official or private party in order to influence official action or otherwise gain an unfair business advantage, such as to obtain or retain business. We have implemented policies, procedures, and internal controls that are designed to comply with these laws and regulations.Additional Regulatory Developments. Various regulatory agencies also continue to examine a wide variety of issues, including virtual currencies, identity theft, account management guidelines, privacy, disclosure rules, security and marketing that would impact PayPal.For an additional discussion on governmental regulation affecting our business, please see the risk factors related to regulation of our payments business and regulation in the areas of consumer privacy, data use and/or security in “Item 1A: Risk Factors -Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition” and Item 3: Legal Proceedings\" included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 9 Table of Contents Seasonality The Company does not experience meaningful seasonality. No individual quarter in 2015, 2014 or 2013 accounted for more than 30% of net revenue. Research and Development Total research and development expense was $947 million, $890 million and $727 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Financial Information About Segments See “Note 10—Segment and Geographical Information” to the combined and consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for certain financial information about segments. Additionally, please see the information in \"Item 1A: Risk Factors\" under the caption \"Our international operations are subject to increased risks, which could harm our business,\" which describes risks associated with the foreign operations of segments. 10 Table of Contents Employees As of December 31, 2015, we employed approximately 16,800 people globally, of whom approximately 9,800 were located in the U.S. We consider our relationship with employees to be good. Separation from eBay Inc. PayPal Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in January 2015 for the purpose of owning and operating eBay’s Payments business in connection with the separation and distribution described below. Prior to the contribution of this business to PayPal Holdings, Inc., which occurred prior to the distribution in July 2015, PayPal Holdings, Inc. had no operations. On July 17, 2015 (the “distribution date”), PayPal became an independent publicly-traded company through the pro rata distribution by eBay of 100% of the outstanding common stock of PayPal to eBay stockholders (which we refer to as the “separation” or the “distribution”). Each eBay stockholder of record as of the close of business on July 8, 2015 received one share of PayPal common stock for every share of eBay common stock held on the record date. Approximately 1.2 billion shares of PayPal common stock were distributed on July 17, 2015 to eBay stockholders. PayPal’s common stock began “regular way” trading under the ticker symbol “PYPL” on The NASDAQ Stock Market on July 20, 2015. Prior to the separation, eBay transferred substantially all of the assets and liabilities and operations of eBay’s payments business to PayPal, which was completed in June 2015.

RISK FACTORS The following discussion is divided into three sections. The first section, which begins immediately following this paragraph, discusses some of the risks that may affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The second section, captioned “Risks Related to the Separation and Our Operation as an Independent Publicly Traded Company,” discusses some of the risks relating to our separation into an independent publicly traded company. The third section, captioned “Risks Related to Our Common Stock,” discusses some of the risks relating to an investment in our Common Stock. You should carefully review all of these sections, as well as our combined and consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the other information appearing in this report, for important information regarding risks that affect us. Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition Substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry may harm our business. The global payments industry is highly competitive. We compete against businesses in varied industries, many of which are larger than we are, have a dominant and secure position in other industries, or offer other goods and services to consumers and merchants which we do not offer. As online and offline commerce are increasingly converging, the pace of change, innovation and disruption is also increasing. The global payments industry is rapidly changing, highly innovative and increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny, which may negatively affect the competitive landscape. We compete against a wide range of businesses with varying roles in all forms of payments, including:•paper-based transactions (principally cash and checks);•providers of traditional payment methods, particularly credit and debit cards, and Automated Clearing House transactions (in particular, well-established banks);•payment networks which facilitate payments for credit card users;•providers of “digital wallets” which offer customers the ability to pay online and/or on mobile devices through a variety of payment methods, including with mobile applications, through contactless payments, and with a variety of payment cards (these providers include Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Amazon.com, Wal-Mart, the Merchant Customer Exchange (MCX) initiative supported by major U.S. retailers, Apple, Google, and others);•providers of mobile payments solutions that use tokenized card data approaches and Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality (e.g., Apple's mobile Apple Pay) or Host Card Emulation (HCE) functionality to eliminate the need for access to the physical secure element in the device (e.g., Google's Android solution);•payment-card processors that offer their services to merchants, including for “card on file” payments where the merchant invites the consumer to select a payment method for their first transaction, and subsequently uses the same payment method for subsequent transactions;•providers of “person-to-person” payments that facilitate individuals sending money with an email address or mobile phone number, such as Facebook messaging payments, Google and many banks;•merchants and merchant associations providing proprietary payment networks to facilitate payments within their own retail network, such as Wal-Mart;•money remitters, such as MoneyGram, Western Union, Global Payments, Inc. and Euronet; and•providers of card readers for mobile devices and of other point-of-sale and multi-channel technologies.We often partner with many of these businesses.We also face competition and potential competition from:•services that provide online merchants the ability to offer their customers the option of paying for purchases from their bank account or paying on credit in the United States and abroad;•issuers of stored value targeted at online payments;•other international online payment-services providers;•other providers of online account-based payments;•payment services targeting users of social networks and online gaming, including those offering billing to the consumer’s mobile phone account;•mobile payment services between bank accounts;•payment services enabling banks to offer their online banking customers the ability to send and receive payments through their bank account;•online shopping services that provide special offers linked to a specific payment provider; and•services that help merchants accept and manage virtual currencies.Some of these payment providers have greater customer bases, volume, scale, resources, and market share than we do, which may provide significant competitive advantages. Some of our competitors may also be subject to less burdensome licensing, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, and other regulatory requirements. They may devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of products and services, and they may offer lower prices or more effectively introduce their own innovative programs and services that adversely impact our growth. We also expect new entrants, as well as established banks and other financial institutions that do not currently offer online payments, to offer competitive products and services in the future. In addition, some merchants provide such services for themselves. Competing services tied to established banks and other financial institutions may engender greater consumer confidence in the safety and efficacy of their services. In certain countries, such as Germany, Netherlands and Australia, electronic funds transfer is a leading method of payment for both online and offline transactions with which our products compete. We compete primarily on the basis of the following:•ability to attract, retain and engage both merchants and consumers;•ability to show that merchants will achieve incremental sales by offering our PayPal services;•security of transactions and the ability for consumers to use our PayPal products and services without sharing their financial information with the merchant or the party they are paying;•simplicity of our fee structure;•ability to develop services across multiple commerce channels, including mobile payments and payments at the retail point of sale;•trust in our dispute resolution and buyer and seller protection programs;•customer service;•brand recognition;•website, mobile platform and application onboarding, ease-of-use and accessibility;•system reliability and data security;•ease and quality of integration into third-party mobile applications and operating systems; and•quality of developer tools, such as our application programming interfaces and software development kits.If we are not able to differentiate our business from those of our competitors, drive value for our customers, or effectively align our resources with our goals and objectives, we may not be able to compete effectively against our competitors. Our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threats could materially and adversely harm our business. 12 Table of Contents Our operating and financial results come primarily from transactions involving payments made in a reporting period and are therefore subject to fluctuations that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as well as the trading price of our common stock. Our operating and financial results have varied on a quarterly basis during our operating history and may continue to fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including as a result of the risks set forth in this “Risk Factors” section. It is difficult for us to forecast the level or source of our revenues or earnings (loss) accurately. In view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful, and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance. We do not have a backlog, and substantially all of our net revenues each quarter come primarily from transactions involving payments during that quarter. Due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting revenues, it is also difficult to forecast expenses as a percentage of net revenues. Quarterly and annual expenses as a percentage of net revenues reflected in our financial statements may be significantly different from historical or projected rates. Our operating results in one or more future quarters may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. The trading price of our common stock could decline, perhaps substantially, as a result of the factors described in this paragraph. Global and regional economic conditions could harm our business. Our operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions. Adverse economic conditions and events have negatively impacted regional and global financial markets in the past and will likely continue to do so from time to time in the future. These events and conditions could have a negative and adverse impact on the companies and customers with which we do business. In addition, financial turmoil affecting the banking system or financial markets could cause additional consolidation of the financial services industry, significant financial service institution failures, new or incremental tightening in the credit markets, low liquidity, and extreme volatility or distress in the fixed income, credit, currency, and equity markets. Adverse impacts to the companies and customers with which we do business, the banking system, or financial markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, including a reduction in the volume and prices of transactions on our payments platforms. 13 Table of Contents If we cannot keep pace with rapid technological developments, particularly developments with respect to mobile payments, to provide new and innovative programs, products and services, the use of our products and our revenues could decline. Rapid, significant, and disruptive technological changes continue to impact the industries in which we operate, including developments in payment card tokenization, ecommerce (e.g., social commerce), mobile, virtual currencies and near field communication and other proximity payment devices, such as contactless payments. We cannot predict the effects of technological changes on our business. In addition to our own initiatives and innovations, we rely in part on third parties, including some of our competitors, for the development of and access to new technologies. We expect that new services and technologies applicable to the industries in which we operate will continue to emerge, which may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies we currently use in our products and services. Developing and incorporating new technologies into our products and services may require substantial expenditures, take considerable time, and ultimately may not be successful. In addition, our ability to adopt new services and develop new technologies may be inhibited by industry-wide standards, payments networks, new laws and regulations, resistance to change from consumers or merchants, or third-party intellectual property rights. Our success will depend on our ability to develop and incorporate new technologies and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards; if we are unable to do so in a timely or cost-effective manner, our business could be harmed.For example, mobile devices are increasingly used for ecommerce transactions and payments, and a significant and growing portion of our customers access our Payments Platform through mobile devices. We may lose customers if we are not able to continue to meet our customers’ mobile and multi-screen experience expectations. The variety of technical and other configurations across different mobile devices and platforms increases the challenges associated with this environment. In addition, a number of other companies with significant resources and a number of innovative startups have introduced products and services focusing on mobile markets. Our ability to successfully address the challenges posed by the rapidly evolving market for mobile transactions is crucial to our continued success, and any failure to continue to increase the volume of mobile transactions effected through our Payments Platform could harm our business. Changes in how consumers fund their PayPal transactions could harm our business. We pay significant transaction fees when consumers fund payment transactions using credit cards, lower fees when consumers fund payments with debit cards, nominal fees when consumers fund payment transactions by electronic transfer of funds from bank accounts, and nominal fees when consumers fund payment transactions from an existing PayPal account balance or through our PayPal Credit products. Our financial success is highly sensitive to changes in the rate at which our consumers fund payments using credit and debit cards (collectively, “payment cards”), which can significantly increase our costs. Some of our consumers may prefer to use payment cards, especially if these payment cards offer functionality and benefits not associated with the use of their bank accounts. Some of our offerings, including the ability of consumers to make a limited number of “guest” payments without opening a PayPal account, have a higher rate of payment card funding than our basic product offering. An increase in the portion of our payment volume funded using payment cards or in fees associated with our funding mix, or other events or developments that make it more difficult or costly for us to fund transactions by electronic transfer of funds from bank accounts or existing PayPal account balances, could materially and adversely affect our financial performance and significantly harm our business. Some of our plans to lower our funding costs, including our PayPal Credit products and enabling consumers to defer payment for a short period of time on some transactions, may increase the risk to us of nonpayment by consumers. Our business is subject to cyberattacks and security and privacy breaches. Our business involves the collection, storage, processing and transmission of customers’ personal data, including financial information. In addition, a significant number of our customers authorize us to bill their payment card or bank accounts directly for all transaction and other fees charged by us. We have built our reputation on the premise that our Payments Platform offers customers a secure way to make payments. An increasing number of organizations, including large on-line and off-line merchants and businesses, other large Internet companies, financial institutions, and government institutions, have disclosed breaches of their information security systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks, including on portions of their websites or infrastructure. For example, in May 2014, eBay Inc. publicly announced that criminals were able to penetrate and steal certain data, including user names, encrypted user passwords and other non-financial user data, from certain of eBay's Marketplaces business unit databases, which led to eBay Marketplaces requiring a password reset and fewer eBay Marketplaces transactions using our PayPal services. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized, improper or illegal access to our systems, our data or customers' data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems are constantly evolving, may be difficult to detect quickly, and often are not recognized until launched against a target. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means, including, among others, hacking into the systems or facilities of us or our partners or customers, or attempting to fraudulently induce our employees, partners, customers or others into disclosing user names, passwords, payment card information, or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems. Certain efforts may be state-sponsored and supported by significant financial and technological resources, making them even more difficult to detect. As a result of our prominence, we believe that we are a particularly attractive target for such breaches and attacks. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and customer data and to prevent data loss and other security breaches, and expect to expend significant additional resources to bolster these protections, these security measures cannot provide absolute security, Our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyberattacks or security breaches, and third parties may be able to access our customers’ personal or proprietary information and payment card data that are stored on or accessible through those systems. Our security measures may also be breached due to employee error, malfeasance, system errors or vulnerabilities, or other irregularities. Any actual or perceived breach of our security could interrupt our operations; result in our systems or services being unavailable; result in improper disclosure of data; materially harm our reputation and brand; result in significant legal and financial exposure; lead to loss of customer confidence in, or decreased use of, our products and services; and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Any breaches of network or data security at our partners or customers could have similar effects. In addition, our customers could have vulnerabilities on their own computer systems that are entirely unrelated to our systems, but could mistakenly attribute their own vulnerabilities to PayPal.In addition, under payment card rules and our contracts with our card processors, if there is a breach of payment card information that we store, or that is stored by our direct payment card processing customers, we could be liable to the payment card issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses. We also expect to expend significant additional resources to protect against security or privacy breaches, and may be required to redress problems caused by breaches. Among other reasons, financial services regulators in various jurisdictions, including the United States and the European Union, have implemented or are considering proposals to impose new authentication requirements on banks and payment processors intended to reduce online fraud, which could impose significant costs, require us to change our business practices, make it more difficult for new customers to join PayPal, and reduce the ease of use of our products, which could harm our business. Additionally, our insurance policies carry low coverage limits, which may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches, and we may not be able to collect fully, if at all, under these insurance policies. 14 Table of Contents Systems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our websites, applications, products or services could harm our business. Our systems may experience service interruptions or degradation because of hardware and software defects or malfunctions, computer denial-of-service and other cyberattacks, human error, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, natural disasters, power losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist attacks, computer viruses or other malware, or other events. Our systems also may be subject to break-ins, sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. In addition, as a provider of payments solutions, we are subject to increased scrutiny by regulators that may require specific business continuity, resiliency and disaster recovery plans and more rigorous testing of such plans. This increased scrutiny may be costly and time-consuming and may divert our resources from other business priorities.We have experienced and will likely continue to experience system failures, denial of service attacks and other events or conditions from time to time that interrupt the availability or reduce or affect the speed or functionality of our products and services. These events have resulted and likely will result in loss of revenue. A prolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in the availability, speed or other functionality of our products and services could materially harm our business. Frequent or persistent interruptions in our services could cause current or potential customers to believe that our systems are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid our products and services, and could permanently harm our reputation and brands. Moreover, to the extent that any system failure or similar event results in damages to our customers or their businesses, these customers could seek significant compensation or contractual penalties from us for their losses and those claims, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and costly for us to address, and could have other consequences described in this “Risk Factors” section under the caption “Our business is subject to cyberattacks and security and privacy breaches.”Our Payments Platform has suffered significant intermittent unavailability. Reliability is particularly critical for us because the full-time availability of our PayPal products and services is critical to our goal of gaining widespread acceptance among consumers and merchants for digital and mobile payments. We have undertaken certain system upgrades and re-platforming efforts designed to improve our reliability and speed. These efforts are costly and time-consuming, involve significant technical risk and may divert our resources from new features and products, and there can be no guarantee that these efforts will succeed. Because we are a regulated financial institution in certain jurisdictions, frequent or persistent site interruptions could lead to regulatory scrutiny, significant fines and penalties, and mandatory and costly changes to our business practices, and ultimately could cause us to lose existing licenses that we need to operate or prevent or delay us from obtaining additional licenses that we need to expand our business.We also rely on facilities, components and services supplied by third parties, including eBay, and our business may be materially adversely affected to the extent these components or services do not meet our expectations or these third parties cease to provide the services or facilities. We do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for all losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of systems failures and similar events. 15 Table of Contents Changes to payment card networks or bank fees, rules, or practices could harm our business. We do not directly access the payment card networks, such as Visa and MasterCard, that enable our acceptance of credit cards and debit cards, including some types of prepaid cards. Accordingly, we must rely on banks or other payment processors to process transactions and must pay fees for the services. From time to time, payment card networks have increased, and may increase in the future, the interchange fees and assessments that they charge for each transaction which accesses their networks. Our payment card processors may have the right to pass any increases in interchange fees and assessments on to us as well as increase their own fees for processing. Any changes in interchange fees and assessments could increase our operating costs and reduce our operating income.In addition, in some jurisdictions, governments have required Visa and MasterCard to reduce interchange fees, or have opened investigations as to whether Visa’s or MasterCard’s interchange fees and practices violate antitrust law. In the United States, the Federal Reserve Board issued a final rule capping debit card interchange fees at significantly lower rates than Visa or MasterCard previously charged. In the European Union, the Multilateral Interchange Fee (“MIF”) Regulation limits credit and debit interchange fees for payments and imposes business rules on card processing services. Any material reduction in credit or debit card interchange rates in the United States or other markets could adversely affect our competitive position against traditional credit and debit card service providers, and may subject us to pricing pressure, although it would also lower our costs. Future changes to those regulations could potentially adversely affect our business.We are required by our processors to comply with payment card network operating rules, including special operating rules for payment service providers to merchants, and we have agreed to reimburse our processors for any fines they are assessed by payment card networks as a result of any rule violations by us or our merchants. The payment card networks set and interpret the card operating rules. From time to time, the networks have alleged that various aspects of our business model violate these operating rules. If such allegations are not resolved, they may result in material fines and penalties or require changes in our business practices that may be costly. The payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or re-interpret existing rules that we or our processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow, or costly to implement. As a result, we could lose our ability to give consumers the option of using payment cards to fund their payments or the choice of currency in which they would like their payment card to be charged. If we are unable to accept payment cards or are meaningfully limited in our ability to do so, our business would be adversely affected.We and our payment card processors have implemented specific business processes for merchants to comply with payment card network operating rules for providing services to merchants. Any failure to comply with these rules could result in fines. We are also subject to fines from payment card networks if we fail to detect that merchants are engaging in activities that are illegal or that are considered “high risk,” primarily the sale of certain types of digital content. For “high risk” merchants, we must either prevent such merchants from using our PayPal services or register such merchants with the payment card networks and conduct additional monitoring with respect to such merchants. Although the amount of these fines has not been material to date, additional fines in the future could become material and could result in a termination of our ability to accept payment cards or require changes in our process for registering new customers, which would materially harm our business. Payment card network rules may also increase the cost of, impose restrictions on, or otherwise negatively impact the development of, our retail point-of-sale solutions, which may negatively impact their deployment and adoption. Failure to deal effectively with fraud, fictitious transactions, bad transactions, and negative customer experiences would increase our loss rate and harm our business, and could severely diminish merchant and consumer confidence in and use of our services. We incur substantial losses due to claims from consumers that merchants have not performed or that their goods or services do not match the merchant’s description. We seek to recover such losses from the merchant, but may not be able to recover in full if the merchant is unwilling or unable to pay. We also incur losses from claims that the consumer did not authorize the purchase, from consumer fraud, from erroneous transmissions and from customers who have closed bank accounts or have insufficient funds in them to satisfy payments. In addition, if losses incurred by us related to payment card transactions become excessive, they could potentially result in our losing the right to accept payment cards for payment, which would harm our business. Our PayPal Credit products are similarly subject to the risk of fraudulent activity. We have taken measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud, but these measures need to be continually improved and may not be effective against new and continually evolving forms of fraud or in connection with new product offerings. If these measures do not succeed, our business could be harmed. 16 Table of Contents We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We have significant operations internationally that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar, subjecting us to foreign currency risk. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar versus the British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar, and Canadian Dollar impacts the translation of our net revenues generated in these foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar. Additionally, in connection with providing our services in multiple currencies, we set our foreign exchange rates twice per day. We may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the times that we set them. Given that we also hold some corporate and customer funds in non-U.S. currencies, our financial results are affected by the translation of these non-U.S. currencies into U.S. dollars. We also have foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. While we regularly enter into transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency translation and balance sheet exposure, it is impossible to predict or eliminate the effects of this exposure. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could significantly impact our financial results. Any factors that reduce cross-border trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business. Cross-border trade (i.e., transactions where the merchant or consumer were in different countries) is an important source of our revenue and profits. Cross-border transactions generally provide higher revenues and operating income than similar transactions that take place within a single country or market. Cross-border trade also represents our primary (and in some cases, our only) presence in certain important markets.Cross-border trade is subject to, and may be impacted by, foreign exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, the potential interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions (e.g., the jurisdiction of the merchant and of the consumer) are often extremely complicated in the context of cross-border trade. The interpretation and/or application of such laws could impose additional requirements (which may impose conflicting obligations) and restrictions on cross-border trade. Any factors that increase the costs of cross-border trade or restrict, delay, or make cross-border trade more difficult or impractical would lower our revenues and profits and could harm our business. Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight, as well as extensive, complex, overlapping and frequently changing rules, regulations and legal interpretations. Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight. For a discussion of how government regulation impacts key aspects of our business, please see Item I - “Business—Government Regulation” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our business is also subject to laws, rules, regulations, policies and legal interpretations in the markets in which we operate, including (but not limited to) those governing banking, credit, deposit taking, cross-border and domestic money transmission, foreign exchange, privacy, data protection, banking secrecy, payment services (including payment processing and settlement services), consumer protection, anti-money laundering, and counter-terrorist financing. The legal and regulatory requirements applicable to us are extensive, complex, frequently changing, and increasing in number, and may impose overlapping and/or conflicting requirements or obligations. Financial and political events have increased the level of regulatory scrutiny on the payments industry, and regulatory agencies may view matters or interpret laws and regulations differently than they have in the past and in a manner adverse to our business. Our success and increased visibility may result in increased regulatory oversight and tighter enforcement of rules and regulations that may apply to our business.As we expand and localize our international activities, we are increasingly becoming obligated to comply with the laws of the countries or markets in which we operate. In addition, because our services are accessible worldwide and we facilitate sales of goods and provide services to customers worldwide, one or more jurisdictions may claim that we or our customers are required to comply with their laws. Laws regulating the Internet, mobile and related technologies outside of the United States often impose different, more specific, or even conflicting obligations on us , as well as broader liability. For example, certain transactions that may be permissible in a local jurisdiction may be prohibited by regulations of U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) or U.S. anti-money laundering or counter-terrorist financing regulations. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or new laws and regulations (including changes to or expansion of the interpretation of those laws and regulations), including those discussed in this risk factor, may subject us to significant fines, penalties, criminal and civil lawsuits, forfeiture of significant assets, and other enforcement actions in one or more jurisdictions; result in additional compliance and licensure requirements; increase regulatory scrutiny of our business; restrict our operations; force us to change our business practices, make product or operational changes or delay planned product launches or improvements. The foregoing could, individually or in the aggregate, expose us to significant liability, impose significant costs, require us to expend substantial resources, increase the cost and complexity of compliance, damage our brand and business, make our products and services less attractive, result in the loss of customers, limit our ability to grow the business, adversely affect our results of operations, and harm our reputation. The complexity of U.S. federal and state regulatory and enforcement regimes, coupled with the global scope of our operations and the evolving global regulatory environment, could result in a single event giving rise to a large number of overlapping investigations and legal and regulatory proceedings by multiple government authorities in different jurisdictions. We have implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws, and regulations, but there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations. 17 Table of Contents Payments Regulation In the United States, PayPal, Inc. has obtained licenses to operate as a money transmitter (or its equivalent) in the states where it is required, as well as in the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. This license includes not only the PayPal branded products and services in these states, but also our Venmo branded products and services. Our subsidiary, Xoom, is also licensed as a money transmitter in certain U.S. states. As licensed money transmitters, PayPal and Xoom are subject to restrictions with respect to their investment of customer funds, reporting requirements, bonding requirements and inspection by state regulatory agencies. Accordingly, if we violate these laws or regulations, we could be subject to liability and/or additional restrictions, forced to cease doing business with residents of certain states, forced to change our business practices or be required to obtain additional licenses or regulatory approvals that could impose substantial costs.While we currently allow our consumers with credit cards to send payments from approximately 200 markets, we allow customers in only approximately half of those markets (including the United States) to also receive payments, in some cases with significant restrictions on the manner in which customers can withdraw funds. These limitations may affect our ability to grow our business in these markets. Of the markets whose residents can use our PayPal services, approximately 30 markets are in member states of the European Union. We provide our services to customers in the European Union through PayPal (Europe) S.à r.l. et Cie, SCA (“PayPal (Europe)”), our wholly-owned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a bank in Luxembourg. Accordingly, PayPal (Europe) is subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if it violates the disclosure, reporting, anti-money-laundering, capitalization, fund management, corporate governance, privacy, data protection, information security, banking secrecy, taxation, sanctions, or other requirements imposed on Luxembourg banks. In addition, European Union laws and regulations are typically subject to different and potentially inconsistent interpretations by the countries that are members of the European Union, which can make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage.In Australia, we serve our customers through PayPal Australia Pty. Ltd. (“PayPal Australia”), which is licensed by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission as a provider of a non-cash payment product and by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority as a purchased payment facility provider, which is a type of authorized depository institution. Accordingly, PayPal Australia is subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if it violates the product disclosure, reporting, anti-money laundering, capitalization, privacy, corporate governance or other requirements imposed on Australian depository institutions.In many of the other markets in which we do business, including Canada and a number of markets in Asia, Central America and South America, we serve our customers through PayPal Pte. Ltd., our wholly-owned subsidiary that is based in Singapore. PayPal Pte. Ltd. is supervised by the Monetary Authority of Singapore and is designated as a holder of a stored value facility and does not hold a remittance license. As a result, PayPal Pte. Ltd. is not able to offer outbound remittance payments (including donations to charities) from Singapore, and can only offer payments for the purchase of goods and services in Singapore. In many of the markets (other than Singapore) served by PayPal Pte. Ltd., it is unclear and uncertain whether our Singapore-based service is subject only to Singapore law or, if it is subject to the application of local laws, whether such local laws would require a payment processor like us to be licensed as a payments service, bank, financial institution or otherwise.We are also subject to regulation in other markets in which we do business and we have been and expect to continue to be required to apply for various licenses, certifications and regulatory approvals in a number of the countries where we provide our services. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such licenses. Even if we were able to obtain such licenses, there are substantial costs and potential product changes involved in maintaining such licenses, and we could be subject to fines or other enforcement action if we are found to violate disclosure, reporting, anti-money laundering, capitalization, corporate governance or other requirements of such licenses. These factors could impose substantial additional costs and involve considerable delay to the development or provision of our products in certain countries.In many other countries it may not be clear whether we are required to be licensed as a payment services provider, bank, financial institution or otherwise. In such markets, we may rely on local banks to process payments and conduct foreign exchange in local currency. Local regulators may use their power to slow or halt payments to local merchants conducted through the local bank. Such regulatory actions or the need to obtain licenses, certifications or other regulatory approvals could impose substantial costs and involve considerable delay to the provision or development of our services in a given market, or could require significant and costly operational changes or prevent us from providing any services in a given market. 18 Table of Contents Consumer Protection We are subject to consumer protection laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. The financial services sector has been increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny. In the U.S., we have been, and we expect that we will continue to be, required to make additional disclosures to our consumers and to comply with new restrictions and requirements on our activities. Among other things, our services are subject to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Regulation E issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). Under such regulations, among other things, we are required to provide advance disclosure of changes to our services, to follow specified error resolution procedures and to reimburse consumers for losses from certain transactions not authorized by the consumer. Additionally, even technical violations of these laws can result in assessment of actual damages or statutory damages or penalties of up to $1,000 in individual cases or up to $500,000 per violation in any class action and treble damages in some instances, and we could also be liable for plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees. We are subject to, and have paid amounts in settlement of, lawsuits containing allegations that our business violated the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Regulation E or otherwise advance claims for relief relating to our business practices (e.g., that we improperly held consumer funds or otherwise improperly limited consumer accounts). In January 2012, the CFPB finalized rules under Regulation E, mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act, which required us, beginning in October 2013, to provide additional disclosures, error resolution rights, and cancellation rights to U.S. consumers who make international remittance payments. In November 2014, the CFPB proposed a new prepaid account rule that would apply to prepaid cards, mobile wallets and potentially PayPal accounts. In December 2014, we became subject to CFPB supervision and examination pursuant to a new regulation that allows the CFPB to supervise all companies, including PayPal, that provide more than one million international remittance transfers per year. Under the regulation, CFPB examiners are now able to examine us for compliance with the remittance transfer rule and other laws and regulations. These and other rules promulgated by the CFPB could increase our costs and require us to expend substantial resources and make changes to our business practices. In May 2015, we entered into a Stipulated Final Judgment and Consent Order (\"Consent Order\") with the CFPB in which we settled regulatory claims arising from PayPal Credit practices between 2011 and 2015. The Consent Order included obligations on PayPal to pay $15 million in redress to consumers and a $10 million civil monetary penalty, and required PayPal to make various changes to the PayPal Credit disclosures and related business practices. We continue to cooperate and engage with the CFPB and work to ensure compliance with the Consent Order, which may result in us incurring additional costs associated with compliance or redress. PayPal (Europe) offers its services in European Union countries through a “passport” notification process through the Luxembourg regulator to regulators in other European Union member states pursuant to European Union Directives, and has completed the “passport” notification process in all European Union member countries. The regulators in these countries could notify PayPal (Europe) of local consumer protection laws that apply to its business, in addition to Luxembourg consumer protection law, and could also seek to persuade the Luxembourg regulator to order PayPal (Europe) to conduct its activities in the local country through a branch office. These or similar actions by these regulators could increase the cost of, or delay, our plans for expanding our business in European Union countries. In addition, the countries that are members of the European Union may each have different and potentially inconsistent interpretations of regulations implementing the European Union Payment Services Directive, which could make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage. The European Commission has proposed revisions to the Payments Services and Anti-Money Laundering Directives, which could make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage. Finally, if the assets of PayPal (Europe) exceed certain thresholds, or if the European Central Bank (\"ECB\") determines that PayPal (Europe) is a significant supervised entity or that some activity of PayPal (Europe) is subject to oversight by the ECB, PayPal (Europe) or certain of its activities could become directly regulated by the ECB in addition to the Luxembourg regulator, the Commission de surveillance du secteur financier, as our national supervisor, which could subject us to additional requirements and would likely increase compliance costs. 19 Table of Contents Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing We are subject to various anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws and regulations around the world that prohibit, among other things, our involvement in transferring the proceeds of criminal activities. We routinely report to the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"OFAC\") on payments we have rejected or blocked pursuant to OFAC sanctions regulations and on any possible violations of those regulations. In March 2015, we reached a settlement with OFAC regarding possible violations arising from our practices between 2009 and 2013. In addition, we continue to cooperate with OFAC regarding other transactions that could also possibly be in violation of OFAC sanctions regulations. In addition, we continue to cooperate with OFAC regarding other transactions that we have self-reported could also possibly be in violation of OFAC sanctions regulations. Subsequent to our March 2015 settlement, we have received new subpoenas from OFAC seeking additional information about certain of these transactions. Such self-reported transactions could result in claims or actions against us including litigation, injunctions, damage awards, fines or penalties, or require us to change our business practices that could result in a material loss, require significant management time, result in the diversion of significant operational resources or otherwise harm our business. Violation of OFAC sanctions regulations that OFAC determines to be egregious can result in statutory penalties of up to $250,000 per transaction. For a discussion of our dealings with OFAC, please see “Note 11: Commitments and Contingencies - Litigation and Regulatory Matters.”U.S. and other regulators globally continue to increase their scrutiny of compliance with these obligations, which may require us to further revise or expand our compliance program, including the procedures we use to verify the identity of our customers and to monitor international and domestic transactions. Many countries in which we operate also have anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws and regulations, and we have been and continue to be required to make changes to our compliance program in various jurisdictions in response. Regulators regularly re-examine the transaction volume thresholds at which we must obtain and keep applicable records or verify identities of customers and any change in such thresholds could result in greater costs for compliance. Privacy and Protection of User Data We are subject to a number of laws, rules and directives (which we refer to as \"privacy laws\") relating to the collection, use, retention, security, processing and transfer (which we refer to as \"process\") of personally identifiable information about our customers and employees (sometimes called personal data) in the countries where we operate. Much of the personal information that we process, especially financial information, is regulated by multiple privacy laws and, in some cases, the privacy laws of multiple jurisdictions. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between or among us, our subsidiaries, and other parties with which we have commercial relationships. The European Court of Justice in the Schrems case has ruled that the U.S.-E.U. Safe Harbor framework clauses, one compliance method by which companies could transfer personal data regarding citizens of the European Union to the United States, could no longer be relied upon. The potential impact of this ruling is subject to further determination and additional developments, including the potential development of a new form of Safe Harbor framework or a requirement to find alternative bases for the compliant transfer of personal data from the E.U. to the U.S. PayPal, Inc. has not relied on the Safe Harbor framework for the transfer of E.U. personal data to the United States. Rather, when our company was a subsidiary of eBay Inc., we relied on binding corporate rules that permitted such transfers; upon separation from eBay, we have continued to operate under these same binding corporate rules pending the approval of our application for our own independent binding corporate rules. While PayPal, Inc. has not relied on the Safe Harbor framework, some of our data processing subsidiaries, service providers, customers or other business partners do. In addition, because PayPal (Europe) is headquartered in Luxembourg and subject to regulation as a bank in that jurisdiction, we have relied on the “one-stop-shop” concept under which Luxembourg has been our lead data protection regulator in the E.U. However, a recent European Court of Justice ruling (Weltimmo) affecting companies that do business in the E.U. potentially could make us subject to the local data protection laws or regulatory enforcement activities of the various E.U. member states in which we have established legal entities. Regulatory scrutiny of privacy, data protection, collection, use and sharing of data is increasing on a global basis. There is uncertainty associated with the legal and regulatory environment around privacy and data protection laws, which continue to develop in ways we cannot predict. Privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and impose inconsistent or conflicting requirements. Complying with varying jurisdictional requirements could increase the costs and complexity of compliance or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business, and violations of privacy and data protection-related laws can result in significant penalties and damage to our brand and business. In addition, compliance with inconsistent privacy laws may restrict our ability to provide services to our customers. A determination that there have been violations of laws of privacy or data protection laws could expose us to significant damage awards, fines and other penalties that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business and reputation. In addition, because of the large number of text messages, emails, phone calls and other communications we send or make to our customers for various business purposes, communication-related privacy laws that provide a specified monetary damage award or fine for each violation could result in particularly significant damage awards or fines. For example, under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (\"TCPA\"), in the U.S., plaintiffs may seek actual monetary loss or statutory damages of $500 per violation, whichever is greater, and courts may treble the damage award for willful or knowing violations. We have been and may be subject to lawsuits (including class-action lawsuits) containing allegations that our business violated the TCPA. These lawsuits seek damages (including statutory damages) and injunctive relief, among other remedies. Given the large number of communications we send to our customers, a determination that there have been violations of the TCPA or other communications-based statutes could expose us to significant damage awards that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business.We post on our websites our privacy policies and practices including concerning the collection, use and disclosure of user data. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any applicable regulatory requirements or orders, or privacy, data protection, information security or consumer protection-related privacy laws and regulations in one or more jurisdictions could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, including class action privacy litigation in certain jurisdictions, subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments and negative publicity, require us to change our business practices, increase the costs and complexity of compliance, and adversely affect our business. Data protection, privacy and information security have become the subject of increasing public, media and legislative concern. If our customers were to reduce their use of our products and services as a result of these concerns, our business could be harmed. As noted above, we are also subject to the possibility of security and privacy breaches, which themselves may result in a violation of these privacy laws. 20 Table of Contents PayPal is not a bank or licensed lender in the United States and relies upon third parties to make loans and provide other products critical to our business. As PayPal is neither a chartered financial institution nor licensed to make loans in any state, we rely on a third party chartered financial institution to issue the PayPal Credit consumer product in the United States, and a different chartered financial institution to issue the PayPal Working Capital product in the United States. Both of these chartered financial institutions are industrial banks chartered by the State of Utah. In the event of a termination or interruption in the ability of the chartered financial institution that currently issues the PayPal Credit consumer product in the United States to lend under the PayPal Credit consumer product, our chartered financial institution that issues the PayPal Working Capital product in the U.S. has agreed to take ownership of (and originate loans with respect to) all consumer accounts. Nevertheless, any termination or interruption of either bank’s ability to lend could result in the inability to originate any new PayPal Credit or PayPal Working Capital loans. In the event of either bank’s inability to lend, we would either need to reach a similar agreement with another chartered financial institution or obtain our own bank charter or licenses. We may be unable to reach a similar agreement with another partner on favorable terms or at all, and obtaining a bank charter or lending licenses would be a time-consuming and costly process and would subject us to additional laws and regulatory requirements, which could be burdensome and increase our costs. In addition, our commercial relationships with third parties which are federally supervised U.S. financial institutions could subject us to examination by their federal banking regulators with respect to certain services that we provide. Our credit products expose us to additional risks. Our PayPal Credit and PayPal Working Capital products are offered to a wide range of consumers and merchants, and the financial success of these products depends on the effective management of the risk related to these products. The lender for the PayPal Credit product extends credit using proprietary segmentation and credit algorithms and other analytical techniques designed to analyze the credit risk of specific consumers based on their past purchasing and payment history as well as their credit scores. Similarly, to assess a merchant who wishes to obtain a PayPal Working Capital advance, among other indicators, the lender applies a proprietary risk model to help predict the merchant's ability to repay the working capital advance. These risk models may not accurately predict the creditworthiness of a consumer or merchant due to inaccurate assumptions about the particular consumer or merchant or the economic environment or limited product history, among other factors. The accuracy of these risk models and the ability of the lender and our ability to manage credit risk related to our PayPal Credit and PayPal Working Capital products may also be affected by legal or regulatory changes (e.g., bankruptcy laws and minimum payment regulations), competitors’ actions, changes in consumer behavior, changes in the economic environment and other factors. Like other businesses with significant exposure to losses from consumer credit, we face the risk that PayPal Credit consumer account holders will default on their payment obligation, making the receivables uncollectible and creating the risk of potential charge-offs. The non-payment rate among account holders may increase due to, among other things, changes to underwriting standards, worsening economic conditions, such as a recession or greater austerity in various countries, and high unemployment rates. Account holders who miss payments often fail to repay their loans, and account holders who file for protection under the bankruptcy laws generally do not repay their loans.We purchase receivables related to PayPal Credit and PayPal Working Capital products. If we are unable to fund our purchase of these receivables adequately or in a cost-effective manner, or if we are unable to efficiently manage the cash resources utilized for these purposes, our business could be harmed.Our international expansion of our PayPal Credit product offerings exposes us to additional risks, including those discussed below under the risk factor titled “Our international operations are subject to increased risks, which could harm our business.” 21 Table of Contents We are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates. We are exposed to interest rate risk from our investment portfolio and from interest-rate sensitive assets underlying the customer balances we hold on our balance sheet as customer accounts. The assets underlying our customer balances we hold on our balance sheet as customer accounts are maintained in interest and non-interest bearing bank deposits, time deposits, corporate debt securities and U.S. and foreign government and agency securities. We seek to preserve principal while holding eligible liquid assets, as defined by applicable regulatory requirements and commercial law in jurisdictions in which we operate, equal to at least 100% of the aggregate amount of all customer balances. We do not pay interest on amounts due to customers. In addition, fluctuations in interest rates may adversely impact our customers’ spending levels and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amounts owed to us. Higher interest rates often lead to higher payment obligations by customers to us and other lenders under mortgage, credit card and other consumer loans, which may reduce our customers’ ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore lead to increased delinquencies, charge-offs and allowance for loan and interest receivable which could have an adverse effect on our net income.In July 2015, we entered into a revolving credit facility. As a result, we will be exposed to fluctuations in interest rates to the extent of our borrowings under the facility, which bear interest at a floating rate. Changes to our buyer and seller protection programs could increase our loss rate. Our buyer and seller protection programs protect merchants and consumers from fraudulent transactions. In 2015, we increased the scope of our buyer protection program to cover digital goods and intangible goods and services. In addition, consumers who pay through PayPal may have reimbursement rights from their payment card issuer (usually a bank), which in turn will seek recovery from us. The risk of losses from our buyer and seller protection programs are specific to individual buyers, sellers and transactions, and may also be impacted by regional variations to these programs, modifications to these programs resulting from changes in regulatory requirements, or changes that we decide to implement, such as expanding the scope of transactions covered by one or more of these programs. Upon PayPal becoming an independent publicly-traded company on July 17, 2015 through the distribution of 100 percent of the outstanding capital stock of PayPal to eBay’s stockholders, which we refer to as the distribution, we extended our protection programs in several countries to cover certain customers’ purchases on eBay, and our costs associated with these programs have therefore increased. Increases in our loss rate, including as a result of changing our buyer and seller protection programs, could harm our business. Our international operations are subject to increased risks, which could harm our business. Our international operations, especially in European Union countries (in particular, United Kingdom and Germany) and China, have generated approximately one-half of our net revenues in recent years. In addition to uncertainty about our ability to generate revenues from our foreign operations and expand into international markets, and the foreign currency risks discussed earlier in this “Risk Factors” section under the caption “We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates,” there are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:•expenses associated with localizing our products and services and customer data, including offering customers the ability to transact business in the local currency and adapting our products and services to local preferences (e.g., payment methods) with which we may have limited or no experience;•trade barriers and changes in trade regulations;•difficulties in developing, staffing, and simultaneously managing a large number of varying foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences;•stringent local labor laws and regulations;•credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;•profit repatriation restrictions, foreign currency exchange restrictions or extreme fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for a particular currency;•political or social unrest, economic instability, repression, or human rights issues;•geopolitical events, including natural disasters, public health issues, acts of war, and terrorism;•import or export regulations;•compliance with U.S. laws and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, and other local anticorruption laws; •compliance with U.S. and foreign laws designed to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities; •antitrust and competition regulations;•potentially adverse tax developments and consequences;•economic uncertainties relating to sovereign and other debt;•different, uncertain, or more stringent user protection, data protection, privacy, and other laws;•risks related to other government regulation or required compliance with local laws;•risks related to multiple overlapping legal or regulatory regimes, which may impose conflicting requirements on us;•national or regional differences in macroeconomic growth rates;•local licensing and reporting obligations; and•increased difficulties in collecting accounts receivable.Violations of the complex foreign and U.S. laws, rules and regulations that apply to our international operations may result in fines, criminal actions, or sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws, violations by our employees, contractors, or agents could nevertheless occur. These risks are inherent in our international operations and expansion, may increase our costs of doing business internationally, and could harm our business. 22 Table of Contents Use of our payments services for illegal purposes could harm our business. Our payment system is susceptible to potentially illegal or improper uses, including money laundering, terrorist financing, illegal online gambling, fraudulent sales of goods or services, illicit sales of prescription medications or controlled substances, piracy of software, movies, music, and other copyrighted or trademarked goods (in particular, digital goods), money laundering, bank fraud, child pornography trafficking, prohibited sales of alcoholic beverages or tobacco products, online securities fraud, or to facilitate other illegal activity. Certain activity that may be legal in one country may be illegal in another country, and a merchant may intentionally or inadvertently be found responsible for importing illegal goods, creating liability to us. Changes in law have increased the penalties for intermediaries providing payment services for certain illegal activities and additional payments-related proposals are under active consideration by government authorities. Intellectual property rights owners or government authorities may seek to bring legal action against providers of payments solutions, including PayPal, that are peripherally involved in the sale of infringing items. Any resulting claims could result in reputational harm and any resulting liabilities, loss of transaction volume or increased costs could harm our business. Our failure to manage the assets underlying our customer funds properly could harm our business. Our ability to manage and account accurately for the assets underlying our customer funds requires a high level of internal controls. As our business continues to grow and we expand our product offerings, we must continue to strengthen our associated internal controls. Our success requires significant public confidence in our ability to handle large and growing transaction volumes and amounts of customer funds. Any failure to maintain the necessary controls or to manage the assets underlying our customer funds accurately could result in reputational harm, lead customers to discontinue or reduce their use of our products and result in significant penalties and fines, which could harm our business. We are subject to regulatory activity and antitrust litigation under competition laws. We are subject to scrutiny by various government agencies under U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including antitrust and competition laws. An increasing number of jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. Other companies and government agencies have in the past and may in the future allege that our actions violate the antitrust or competition laws of the United States, individual states, other countries, or the European Commission, or otherwise constitute unfair competition. An increasing number of governments are regulating competition law activities, including increased scrutiny in large markets such as China. Our business agreements or arrangements with customers or other companies could give rise to regulatory action or antitrust litigation. Some regulators, particularly those outside of the United States, may perceive our business to be used so broadly that otherwise uncontroversial business practices could be deemed anticompetitive. Any claims or investigations, even if without foundation, may be very expensive to defend or respond to, involve negative publicity and substantial diversion of management time and effort and could result in significant judgments against us or require us to change our business practices. 23 Table of Contents We are subject to patent litigation. We have repeatedly been sued for allegedly infringing other parties’ patents. At any given time, we are typically a defendant in a number of patent lawsuits and have been notified of several other potential patent disputes. We expect that we will increasingly be subject to patent infringement claims because, among other reasons:•our products and services continue to expand in scope and complexity;•we continue to expand into new business areas, including through acquisitions; and•the number of patent owners who may claim that we, any of the companies that we have acquired, or our customers infringe their patents, and the aggregate number of patents controlled by such patent owners, continues to increase.Such claims may be brought directly against us and/or against our customers whom we may indemnify either because we are contractually obligated to do so or we choose to do so as a business matter. We believe that an increasing number of these claims against us and other technology companies have been, and continue to be, initiated by third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims. In addition, we have seen significant patent disputes between operating companies in some technology industries. Patent claims, whether meritorious or not, are time-consuming and costly to defend and resolve, and could require us to make expensive changes in our methods of doing business, enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements, make substantial payments to satisfy adverse judgments or settle claims or proceedings, or cease conducting certain operations, which would harm our business. We may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or third parties may allege that we are infringing their intellectual property rights. We believe the protection of our intellectual property, including our trademarks, patents, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, and trade secrets, is critical to our success. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on applicable laws and regulations in the United States and internationally, as well as a variety of administrative procedures. We also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights when offering or procuring products and services, including confidentiality and invention assignment agreements entered into with our employees and contractors and confidentiality agreements with parties with whom we conduct business.Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are made available, and contractual arrangements and other steps that we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our intellectual property or deter independent development of equivalent or superior intellectual property rights by others. We must protect our intellectual property rights, including our trademarks, patents, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, and other proprietary rights in an increasing number of jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and time-consuming. We may not be successful in protecting or enforcing our rights in every jurisdiction. Also, we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. We have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to others. These licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation. Any failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or significant costs incurred in doing so, could materially harm our business.As the number of products in the software industry increases and the functionality of these products further overlaps, and as we acquire technology through acquisitions or licenses, we may become increasingly subject to intellectual property infringement and other claims. Litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of the patent and other intellectual property rights of others. The ultimate outcome of any allegation is uncertain and, regardless of the outcome, any such claim, with or without merit, may be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert management’s time and attention from our business, and require us to, among other things, stop providing transaction processing and other payment related services or redesign, stop selling our products or services, pay substantial amounts to satisfy judgments or settle claims or lawsuits, pay substantial royalty or licensing fees, or satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with certain parties with whom we have commercial relationships. Our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights, or litigation or claims arising out of intellectual property matters, may harm our business. 24 Table of Contents We are regularly subject to general litigation, regulatory disputes, and government inquiries. We are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits (including class actions and individual lawsuits), government and regulatory investigations, and other proceedings involving competition and antitrust law, intellectual property, privacy, data protection, information security, consumer protection, accessibility claims, securities, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, services, escheatment of unclaimed or abandoned property, and other matters. In particular, our business faces ongoing consumer protection and intellectual property litigation, as discussed above. The number and significance of these disputes and inquiries have increased as our company has grown larger, our business has expanded in scope and geographic reach, and our products and services have increased in complexity. In addition, the laws, rules and regulations affecting our business, including those pertaining to Internet and mobile commerce, payments services, and credit, are subject to ongoing interpretation by the courts and governmental authorities, and the resulting uncertainty in the scope and application of these laws, rules and regulations increases the risk that we will be subject to private claims and governmental actions alleging violations of those laws, rules and regulations. The scope, outcome and impact of claims, lawsuits, government investigations, and proceedings that we are subject to cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of the outcome, such investigations and proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. Determining reserves for our pending litigation is a complex, fact-intensive process that is subject to management’s judgment. Resolving one or more such legal and regulatory proceedings could potentially require us to make substantial payments to satisfy judgments, fines or penalties or to settle claims or proceedings, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business. These proceedings could also result in reputational harm, criminal sanctions, consent decrees, or orders preventing us from offering certain products or services, requiring a change in our business practices in costly ways or development of non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies. Any of these consequences could materially and adversely affect our business.Certain of our customer agreements contain arbitration provisions with class action waiver provisions that may limit our exposure to consumer class action litigation, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in enforcing these arbitration provisions, or the class action waiver provisions in them, in the future or in any given case. Legislative, administrative or regulatory developments may directly or indirectly prohibit or limit the use of pre-dispute arbitration clauses and class action waiver provisions. Any such prohibitions or limitations on or discontinuation of the use of such arbitration or class action waiver provisions could subject us to additional lawsuits, including additional consumer class action litigation, or materially impact our ability to avoid exposure from consumer class action litigation. We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities. The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation and significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Like many other multinational corporations, we are subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Our determination of our tax liability is always subject to audit and review by applicable domestic and foreign tax authorities, and we are currently undergoing a number of investigations, audits and reviews by taxing authorities throughout the world, including with respect to our tax structure. Any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could have a negative effect on our business and the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the periods for which such determination is made. While we have established reserves based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventualities, these reserves may prove to be insufficient.In addition, our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated (or by the incurrence of losses) in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, as a result of gains on our foreign exchange risk management program, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items.In light of continuing global fiscal challenges, various levels of government and international organizations such as the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and European Union (EU) are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative or regulatory action to increase tax revenue. These tax reform efforts are designed to ensure that corporate entities are taxed on a larger percentage of their earnings. Any such tax reform or other legislative or regulatory actions to increase tax revenue could increase our effective tax rate. We and our merchants may be subject to sales reporting and record-keeping obligations. One or more states or the federal government or foreign countries may seek to impose reporting or record-keeping obligations on companies that engage in or facilitate ecommerce. Such an obligation could be imposed by legislation intended to improve tax compliance (and legislation to such effect has been contemplated by several additional states and is in the process of being implemented by a number of foreign jurisdictions) or if one of our companies was deemed to be the legal agent of our merchants by a jurisdiction in which it operates. We have modified our software to meet these requirements and expect increased operational costs and changes to our customer experience in connection with complying with these reporting obligations. Any failure by us to comply with these and similar reporting and record-keeping obligations could result in substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions and could harm our business. 25 Table of Contents Acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic investments could result in operating difficulties and could harm our business. We have acquired a significant number of businesses, technologies, services, and products. We expect to continue to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions as part of our overall business strategy, including business combinations, acquisitions, and dispositions of certain businesses, technologies, services, products, and other assets, as well as strategic investments and joint ventures. These transactions may involve significant challenges and risks, including:•the potential loss of key customers, vendors and other key business partners of the companies we acquire, or dispose of, following and continuing after announcement of our transaction plans;•declining employee morale and retention issues affecting employees of companies that we acquire or dispose of, which may result from changes in compensation, management, reporting relationships, future prospects, or the direction of the acquired or disposed business;•difficulty making strategic hires of new employees;•diversion of management time and a shift of focus from operating the business to the transaction, and in the case of an acquisition, integration and administration;•the need to integrate the operations, systems (including accounting, management, information, compliance, human resource and other administrative systems), technologies, products and personnel of each acquired company, which is an inherently risky and potentially lengthy and costly process;•the inefficiencies and lack of control that may result if such integration is delayed or not implemented, and unforeseen difficulties and expenditures that may arise as a result;•the need to implement or improve controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at companies that, prior to acquisition, may have lacked such controls, procedures and policies or whose controls, procedures and policies did not meet applicable legal and other standards;•potential exposure to new or increased regulatory oversight associated with new lines of business;•risks associated with our expansion into new international markets;•lawsuits resulting from the acquisition;•liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including intellectual property and other litigation claims or disputes, violations of laws, rules and regulations, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities;•the potential loss of key employees following the transaction;•the acquisition of new customer and employee personal information, which in and of itself may require regulatory approval and or additional controls, policies and procedures and subject us to additional exposure and additional complexity and costs of compliance; and•our dependence on the acquired business’ accounting, financial reporting, operating metrics and similar systems, controls and processes and the risk that errors or irregularities in those systems, controls and processes will lead to errors in our financial statements or make it more difficult to manage the acquired business.At any given time we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more of these types of transactions and any of these transactions could, individually or in the aggregate, be material to our financial condition and results of operations. It may take us longer than expected to fully realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions, and those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Any acquisitions or dispositions may also require us to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt (and increased interest expense), liabilities, and amortization expenses related to intangible assets or write-offs of goodwill, which could adversely affect our results of operations and dilute the economic and voting rights of our stockholders.We may make certain investments, including through joint ventures, in which we have a minority equity interest and/or lack management and operational control. Under such circumstances, the controlling joint venture partner in a joint venture investment may have business interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours, and business decisions or other actions or omissions of the controlling investor, joint venture partner or joint venture company may result in reputational harm or adversely affect the value of our investment. 26 Table of Contents We are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our services. Companies providing online services may be subject to claims relating to information disseminated through their services, including claims alleging defamation, libel, breach of contract, invasion of privacy, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, among other things. The laws relating to the liability of companies providing online services for information disseminated through their services are subject to frequent challenges both in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. We are also subject to potential liability to third parties for the customer-provided content on our sites, particularly in jurisdictions outside the United States where the applicable laws are unsettled. If we become liable for information provided by our customers and carried on our service, we could be directly harmed and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability, including expending substantial resources or discontinuing certain service offerings, which could harm our business. Problems with or price increases by third parties who provide services to us or to our customers could harm our business. A number of third parties provide services to us or to our customers. As discussed in this Risk Factors section under the caption “Changes to payment card networks or bank fees, rules, or practices could harm our business,” we are dependent on banks and other payment processors that link us to the payment card and bank clearing networks to process transactions. We rely on unaffiliated third party lenders to make the consumer and other loans originated through the PayPal Credit and PayPal Working Capital products. We also rely heavily on third parties to operate our services, including merchant processors and payment gateways to process transactions and third parties that provide loan receivable tracking and customer statements processing. Financial or regulatory issues, labor issues, or other problems that prevent these companies from providing services to us or our customers could harm our business. We have outsourced certain functions to third-party providers, including some customer support and product development functions, which are critical to our operations. If our service providers do not perform satisfactorily, our operations could be disrupted, which could result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business.Price increases or financial penalties by, or service terminations, disruptions or interruptions at, companies that provide services to us and our customers and clients could also make it more difficult for our merchants to complete transactions, thereby harming our business. Some third parties who provide services to us may have or gain market power and be able to increase their prices to us without competitive constraint. In addition, there can be no assurance that third parties who provide services directly to us or our customers will continue to do so on acceptable terms, or at all. If any third parties were to stop providing services to us or our customers on acceptable terms, including as a result of bankruptcy, we may be unable to procure alternatives from other third parties in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all. Our developer platforms, which are open to merchants and third-party developers, subject us to additional risks. We provide third-party developers with access to application programming interfaces, software development kits and other tools designed to allow them to produce applications for use, with a particular focus on mobile applications. There can be no assurance that merchants or third-party developers will develop and maintain applications and services on our open platforms on a timely basis or at all, and a number of factors could cause such third-party developers to curtail or stop development for our platforms. In addition, our business is subject to many regulatory restrictions. It is possible that merchants and third-party developers who utilize our development platforms or tools could violate these regulatory restrictions and we may be held responsible for such violations, which could harm our business. Our retail point of sale solutions expose us to additional risks. We have announced several retail point of sale solutions, which enable merchants to accept payments using a payments card reader attached to, or otherwise communicating with, a mobile device or to scan payment cards and codes using the mobile device’s embedded camera, and which enable consumers to use their mobile devices to pay at the point of sale. As we continue to expand our product and service offerings at the retail point of sale, we will face additional risks, including:•increased expectations from offline retailers regarding the reliability and availability of our systems and services and correspondingly lower amounts of downtime, which we may not be able to meet;•significant competition at the retail point of sale, particularly from established payment card providers such as Visa, MasterCard and American Express, many of which have substantially greater resources than we do;•increased targeting by fraudsters; given that our fraud models are less developed in this area, we may experience increases in fraud and associated transaction losses as we adjust to fraudulent activity at the point of sale;•exposure to product liability claims to the extent that hardware devices that we produce for use at the retail point of sale malfunction or are not in compliance with laws, which could result in substantial liability and require product recalls or other actions;•exposure to additional laws, rules and regulations;•increased reliance on third parties involved with processing in-store payments, including independent software providers, electronic point of sale providers, hardware providers (such as cash register and pin-pad providers), payment processors and banks that enable in-store transactions; and•lower operating income than our other payment solutions.Unless we are able to successfully manage these risks, including driving adoption of, and significant volume through, our retail point of sale solutions over time, our business may be harmed. 27 Table of Contents Our success largely depends on key personnel. Because competition for our key employees is intense, we may not be able to attract, retain, and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our business. The loss of senior management or other key personnel could harm our business. Our future performance depends substantially on the continued services of our senior management and other key personnel, including engineering and product development personnel, and our ability to attract, retain, and motivate such personnel. Competition for key personnel is intense, especially in the Silicon Valley where our corporate headquarters are located, and we may be unable to successfully attract, integrate, or retain sufficiently qualified key personnel. In making employment decisions, particularly in high-technology and payments industries, job candidates often consider the value of the equity awards they would receive in connection with their employment, and fluctuations in our stock price may make it more difficult to attract, retain, and motivate employees. In addition, we do not have long-term employment agreements with any of our key personnel and do not maintain any “key person” life insurance policies. The loss of the services of any of our senior management or other key personnel, or our inability to attract highly qualified senior management and other key personnel, could harm our business. Risks Related to the Separation and Our Operation as an Independent Publicly Traded Company We may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the separation. We may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the separation of PayPal from eBay Inc., which we refer to as the separation, or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all. The separation and distribution were expected to provide the following benefits, among others: enhanced strategic and management focus; better ability to form strategic relationships; faster decision-making; more efficient allocation of capital; alignment of incentives with performance objectives; direct access to the capital markets; and a distinct investment identity. If we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits expected to result from the separation, or if such benefits are delayed, our business could be harmed. If the distribution, together with certain related transactions, does not qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), eBay,PayPal and eBay stockholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities and, in certain circumstances, we could be required to indemnify eBay for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement. eBay received an opinion from its outside legal counsel regarding the qualification of the distribution, together with certain related transactions, as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code. The opinion was based on and relied on, among other things, certain facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements and undertakings of eBay and PayPal, including those relating to the past and future conduct of eBay and PayPal. If any of these representations, statements or undertakings are, or become, inaccurate or incomplete, or if eBay or PayPal breach any of their respective covenants in the separation documents, the opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized.Notwithstanding the opinion of counsel, the IRS could determine that the distribution, together with certain related transactions, should be treated as a taxable transaction if the IRS determines that any of these representations, assumptions, or undertakings upon which such opinion was based are incorrect or have been violated or if the IRS disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel. An opinion of counsel is not binding on the IRS or any court and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge the conclusions reached in the opinion. The IRS did not provide any opinion in advance of the separation that our proposed transaction will be tax-free.If the distribution, together with certain related transactions, failed to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code, in general, eBay would recognize taxable gain as if it had sold the PayPal common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value, eBay stockholders who received PayPal common stock in the distribution may be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares and we could incur significant liabilities. 28 Table of Contents We may not be able to engage in desirable strategic or capital-raising transactions following the separation. In addition, we could be liable for adverse tax consequences resulting from engaging in significant strategic or capital-raising transactions. To preserve the tax-free treatment to eBay of the separation and the distribution, under the tax matters agreement that we entered into with eBay, for a period of time following the distribution, we are generally prohibited from taking certain actions that prevent the distribution and related transactions from qualifying as a transaction that is generally tax-free, for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code. These restrictions may limit our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or other transactions that we or our stockholders might consider desirable or may present us from engaging in certain capital-raising transactions. We have no history of operating as an independent, publicly traded company in our current form, and our historical financial information is not necessarily representative of the results that we would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results. The combined and consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K were derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of eBay and do not necessarily reflect the financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows that we would have achieved as a separate, independent, publicly traded company during the periods presented or those that we will achieve in the future, primarily as a result of the factors described below:•Prior to the separation, our business was operated by eBay as part of its broader corporate organization, rather than as an independent company. eBay or its affiliates performed various corporate functions for us, such as legal, finance, treasury, accounting, tax, auditing, human resources, certain compliance functions, and public affairs. Our historical financial results reflect allocations of corporate expenses from eBay for such functions, which are likely to be less than the comparable expenses we would have incurred had we operated as a separate publicly traded company. In addition, we may need to significantly increase our investment in certain of these functions to maintain appropriate levels of administrative, legal and regulatory compliance. •Prior to the separation, our business was integrated with the other businesses of eBay. Historically, we shared economies of scope and scale in costs, employees, vendor relationships and customer relationships. Although we have entered into arm’s length agreements with eBay, including the operating agreement, these arrangements may not retain or fully capture the benefits that we enjoyed as a result of being integrated with eBay and may result in our paying higher charges than in the past for these services. This could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.•As a part of eBay, we benefited from, among other things, the acquisition of new customers from eBay, capital to fund acquisitions, investments and credit, and data from eBay that helps us to manage risks and maintain a low loss rate. In addition, being a part of eBay enabled us to leverage eBay’s technology capabilities, data, commerce platforms and relationships with retailers, brands and large merchants worldwide. The loss of these synergies and benefits could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.•Generally, our working capital requirements and capital for our general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and capital expenditures, were historically satisfied as part of the corporate-wide cash management policies of eBay. We may need to obtain additional financing from banks, through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities, or through strategic relationships or other arrangements, which may or may not be available and may be more costly.•The cost of capital for our business may be higher than eBay’s cost of capital prior to the separation.Other significant changes may occur in our cost structure, management, financing, and business operations as a result of operating as an independent company separate from eBay. For additional information, please see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the combined and consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 29 Table of Contents eBay remains a significant source of our revenues after the distribution. After the distribution, we continue to derive a significant amount of revenues and operating income from eBay. If the operating agreement expires or is terminated prior to its expiration, or if there is a significant change in our relationship with eBay, including if eBay becomes a merchant of record, eliminates or modifies any of its risk management or customer protection programs, directs transactions to a different provider of payment services or offers eBay customers more payment options, our business could be materially harmed. eBay may fail to perform under various agreements that were executed as part of the separation or we may fail to have necessary systems and services in place when certain of the transaction agreements expire. In connection with the separation, we entered into a separation and distribution agreement with eBay as well as various other agreements, including an operating agreement, colocation services agreements, transition services agreements, a tax matters agreement, an employee matters agreement, an intellectual property matters agreement, a data sharing addendum, and a product development agreement. The separation agreement, the tax matters agreement, the employee matters agreement, and the intellectual property matters agreement determine the allocation of assets and liabilities (including by means of licensing) between the companies following the separation for those respective areas and include any necessary indemnifications related to liabilities and obligations. The operating agreement, the colocation services agreements and the data sharing addendum establish certain commercial relationships between eBay and us related to payment processing, credit, information technology infrastructure and data sharing. The transition services agreements provide for the performance of certain services by each company for the benefit of the other for a limited period of time after the separation. If we or eBay is unable to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements, including its respective indemnification obligations, we could incur operational difficulties or losses or be required to make substantial indemnification or other payments to eBay. If we do not have in place our own systems and services, or if we do not have agreements with other providers of these services once these transaction agreements expire or terminate, we may not be able to operate our business effectively and our financial condition and result of operations may be adversely affected. After the separation, certain of our directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their previous or continuing positions at eBay. Because of their current or former positions with eBay, certain of our directors own eBay common stock and equity awards. Following the separation, even though our board of directors consists of a majority of directors who are independent, some of our directors continue to have a financial interest in eBay common stock and equity awards. In addition, one of our directors continues to serve on the eBay board of directors. Continuing ownership of eBay common stock and equity awards or service as a director at both companies could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest if PayPal and eBay were to have disagreements about the agreements between them or face decisions that could have different implications for PayPal and eBay. Risks Related to Our Common Stock The price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly. The price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:•actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;•changes in earnings estimated by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;•the change in our stockholder base following the distribution;•the operating and stock price performance of comparable companies;•changes to the regulatory and legal environment under which we operate; and•market conditions in the payments industry, the industries of merchants and the domestic and worldwide economy as a whole. 30 Table of Contents PayPal’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the state courts of the State of Delaware, or, if no state court located in the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the District of Delaware, as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by PayPal’s stockholders, which could discourage lawsuits against PayPal and PayPal’s directors and officers. PayPal’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that unless the corporation otherwise determines, the state courts of the State of Delaware, or, if no state court located in the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the District of Delaware, will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of PayPal, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director or officer of PayPal to PayPal or PayPal’s stockholders, creditors or other constituents, any action asserting a claim against PayPal or any director or officer of PayPal arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (\"DGCL\") or PayPal’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against PayPal or any director or officer of PayPal governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of PayPal’s stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes with PayPal or PayPal’s directors or officers, which may discourage such lawsuits against PayPal and PayPal’s directors and officers. Alternatively, if a court outside of Delaware were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above, PayPal could incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect PayPal’s business, financial condition or results of operations. Certain provisions in PayPal’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may prevent or delay an acquisition of PayPal, which could decrease the trading price of PayPal common stock. PayPal’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain certain provisions that may have the effect of deterring coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and by encouraging prospective acquirers to negotiate with PayPal’s board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others:•rules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings;•the fact that directors may not be elected, removed or replaced at stockholder-requested special meetings unless a person, entity or group owns at least a majority of PayPal’s outstanding common stock;•the right of PayPal’s board to issue preferred stock and to determine the voting, dividend and other rights of preferred stock without stockholder approval; and•the ability of PayPal’s directors, and not stockholders, to fill vacancies on PayPal’s board of directors in most circumstances.PayPal has also elected not to be governed by Section 203 of the DGCL, which provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that acquire, or are affiliated with a person that acquires, more than 15% of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the date on which that person or its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15% of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock. PayPal’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, however, contains a provision that generally mirrors Section 203 of the DGCL, except that it provides for a 20% threshold instead of the 15% provided for by the DGCL. These provisions could delay or prevent a change of control that PayPal’s stockholders may favor.Certain of the above provisions were added pursuant to the agreement between eBay Inc. and certain entities under the control of Carl C. Icahn. These provisions are not intended to make PayPal immune from takeovers. However, these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and may delay or prevent an acquisition that PayPal’s board of directors determines is not in the best interests of PayPal and PayPal’s stockholders. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors.In addition, an acquisition or further issuance of PayPal’s stock (including preferred stock) could trigger the application of Section 355(e) of the Code. For a discussion of Section 355(e), see “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” in our registration statement on Form 10, as amended, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Under the tax matters agreement, in such circumstances, PayPal would be required to indemnify eBay for any resulting taxes, which could materially and adversely affect us. Moreover, this indemnity obligation might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control that PayPal’s stockholders may consider favorable. Please refer to “Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions” and “Description of PayPal’s Capital Stock” in our registration statement on Form 10, as amended, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a more detailed description of these agreements and provisions. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. The following discussion is divided into three sections. The first section, which begins immediately following this paragraph, discusses some of the risks that may affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The second section, captioned “Risks Related to the Separation and Our Operation as an Independent Publicly Traded Company,” discusses some of the risks relating to our separation into an independent publicly traded company. The third section, captioned “Risks Related to Our Common Stock,” discusses some of the risks relating to an investment in our Common Stock. You should carefully review all of these sections, as well as our combined and consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the other information appearing in this report, for important information regarding risks that affect us. Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition Substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry may harm our business. The global payments industry is highly competitive. We compete against businesses in varied industries, many of which are larger than we are, have a dominant and secure position in other industries, or offer other goods and services to consumers and merchants which we do not offer. As online and offline commerce are increasingly converging, the pace of change, innovation and disruption is also increasing. The global payments industry is rapidly changing, highly innovative and increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny, which may negatively affect the competitive landscape. We compete against a wide range of businesses with varying roles in all forms of payments, including:•paper-based transactions (principally cash and checks);•providers of traditional payment methods, particularly credit and debit cards, and Automated Clearing House transactions (in particular, well-established banks);•payment networks which facilitate payments for credit card users;•providers of “digital wallets” which offer customers the ability to pay online and/or on mobile devices through a variety of payment methods, including with mobile applications, through contactless payments, and with a variety of payment cards (these providers include Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Amazon.com, Wal-Mart, the Merchant Customer Exchange (MCX) initiative supported by major U.S. retailers, Apple, Google, and others);•providers of mobile payments solutions that use tokenized card data approaches and Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality (e.g., Apple's mobile Apple Pay) or Host Card Emulation (HCE) functionality to eliminate the need for access to the physical secure element in the device (e.g., Google's Android solution);•payment-card processors that offer their services to merchants, including for “card on file” payments where the merchant invites the consumer to select a payment method for their first transaction, and subsequently uses the same payment method for subsequent transactions;•providers of “person-to-person” payments that facilitate individuals sending money with an email address or mobile phone number, such as Facebook messaging payments, Google and many banks;•merchants and merchant associations providing proprietary payment networks to facilitate payments within their own retail network, such as Wal-Mart;•money remitters, such as MoneyGram, Western Union, Global Payments, Inc. and Euronet; and•providers of card readers for mobile devices and of other point-of-sale and multi-channel technologies.We often partner with many of these businesses.We also face competition and potential competition from:•services that provide online merchants the ability to offer their customers the option of paying for purchases from their bank account or paying on credit in the United States and abroad;•issuers of stored value targeted at online payments;•other international online payment-services providers;•other providers of online account-based payments;•payment services targeting users of social networks and online gaming, including those offering billing to the consumer’s mobile phone account;•mobile payment services between bank accounts;•payment services enabling banks to offer their online banking customers the ability to send and receive payments through their bank account;•online shopping services that provide special offers linked to a specific payment provider; and•services that help merchants accept and manage virtual currencies.Some of these payment providers have greater customer bases, volume, scale, resources, and market share than we do, which may provide significant competitive advantages. Some of our competitors may also be subject to less burdensome licensing, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, and other regulatory requirements. They may devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of products and services, and they may offer lower prices or more effectively introduce their own innovative programs and services that adversely impact our growth. We also expect new entrants, as well as established banks and other financial institutions that do not currently offer online payments, to offer competitive products and services in the future. In addition, some merchants provide such services for themselves. Competing services tied to established banks and other financial institutions may engender greater consumer confidence in the safety and efficacy of their services. In certain countries, such as Germany, Netherlands and Australia, electronic funds transfer is a leading method of payment for both online and offline transactions with which our products compete. We compete primarily on the basis of the following:•ability to attract, retain and engage both merchants and consumers;•ability to show that merchants will achieve incremental sales by offering our PayPal services;•security of transactions and the ability for consumers to use our PayPal products and services without sharing their financial information with the merchant or the party they are paying;•simplicity of our fee structure;•ability to develop services across multiple commerce channels, including mobile payments and payments at the retail point of sale;•trust in our dispute resolution and buyer and seller protection programs;•customer service;•brand recognition;•website, mobile platform and application onboarding, ease-of-use and accessibility;•system reliability and data security;•ease and quality of integration into third-party mobile applications and operating systems; and•quality of developer tools, such as our application programming interfaces and software development kits.If we are not able to differentiate our business from those of our competitors, drive value for our customers, or effectively align our resources with our goals and objectives, we may not be able to compete effectively against our competitors. Our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threats could materially and adversely harm our business. 12 Table of Contents Our operating and financial results come primarily from transactions involving payments made in a reporting period and are therefore subject to fluctuations that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as well as the trading price of our common stock. Our operating and financial results have varied on a quarterly basis during our operating history and may continue to fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including as a result of the risks set forth in this “Risk Factors” section. It is difficult for us to forecast the level or source of our revenues or earnings (loss) accurately. In view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful, and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance. We do not have a backlog, and substantially all of our net revenues each quarter come primarily from transactions involving payments during that quarter. Due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting revenues, it is also difficult to forecast expenses as a percentage of net revenues. Quarterly and annual expenses as a percentage of net revenues reflected in our financial statements may be significantly different from historical or projected rates. Our operating results in one or more future quarters may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. The trading price of our common stock could decline, perhaps substantially, as a result of the factors described in this paragraph. Global and regional economic conditions could harm our business. Our operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions. Adverse economic conditions and events have negatively impacted regional and global financial markets in the past and will likely continue to do so from time to time in the future. These events and conditions could have a negative and adverse impact on the companies and customers with which we do business. In addition, financial turmoil affecting the banking system or financial markets could cause additional consolidation of the financial services industry, significant financial service institution failures, new or incremental tightening in the credit markets, low liquidity, and extreme volatility or distress in the fixed income, credit, currency, and equity markets. Adverse impacts to the companies and customers with which we do business, the banking system, or financial markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, including a reduction in the volume and prices of transactions on our payments platforms. 13 Table of Contents If we cannot keep pace with rapid technological developments, particularly developments with respect to mobile payments, to provide new and innovative programs, products and services, the use of our products and our revenues could decline. Rapid, significant, and disruptive technological changes continue to impact the industries in which we operate, including developments in payment card tokenization, ecommerce (e.g., social commerce), mobile, virtual currencies and near field communication and other proximity payment devices, such as contactless payments. We cannot predict the effects of technological changes on our business. In addition to our own initiatives and innovations, we rely in part on third parties, including some of our competitors, for the development of and access to new technologies. We expect that new services and technologies applicable to the industries in which we operate will continue to emerge, which may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies we currently use in our products and services. Developing and incorporating new technologies into our products and services may require substantial expenditures, take considerable time, and ultimately may not be successful. In addition, our ability to adopt new services and develop new technologies may be inhibited by industry-wide standards, payments networks, new laws and regulations, resistance to change from consumers or merchants, or third-party intellectual property rights. Our success will depend on our ability to develop and incorporate new technologies and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards; if we are unable to do so in a timely or cost-effective manner, our business could be harmed.For example, mobile devices are increasingly used for ecommerce transactions and payments, and a significant and growing portion of our customers access our Payments Platform through mobile devices. We may lose customers if we are not able to continue to meet our customers’ mobile and multi-screen experience expectations. The variety of technical and other configurations across different mobile devices and platforms increases the challenges associated with this environment. In addition, a number of other companies with significant resources and a number of innovative startups have introduced products and services focusing on mobile markets. Our ability to successfully address the challenges posed by the rapidly evolving market for mobile transactions is crucial to our continued success, and any failure to continue to increase the volume of mobile transactions effected through our Payments Platform could harm our business. Changes in how consumers fund their PayPal transactions could harm our business. We pay significant transaction fees when consumers fund payment transactions using credit cards, lower fees when consumers fund payments with debit cards, nominal fees when consumers fund payment transactions by electronic transfer of funds from bank accounts, and nominal fees when consumers fund payment transactions from an existing PayPal account balance or through our PayPal Credit products. Our financial success is highly sensitive to changes in the rate at which our consumers fund payments using credit and debit cards (collectively, “payment cards”), which can significantly increase our costs. Some of our consumers may prefer to use payment cards, especially if these payment cards offer functionality and benefits not associated with the use of their bank accounts. Some of our offerings, including the ability of consumers to make a limited number of “guest” payments without opening a PayPal account, have a higher rate of payment card funding than our basic product offering. An increase in the portion of our payment volume funded using payment cards or in fees associated with our funding mix, or other events or developments that make it more difficult or costly for us to fund transactions by electronic transfer of funds from bank accounts or existing PayPal account balances, could materially and adversely affect our financial performance and significantly harm our business. Some of our plans to lower our funding costs, including our PayPal Credit products and enabling consumers to defer payment for a short period of time on some transactions, may increase the risk to us of nonpayment by consumers. Our business is subject to cyberattacks and security and privacy breaches. Our business involves the collection, storage, processing and transmission of customers’ personal data, including financial information. In addition, a significant number of our customers authorize us to bill their payment card or bank accounts directly for all transaction and other fees charged by us. We have built our reputation on the premise that our Payments Platform offers customers a secure way to make payments. An increasing number of organizations, including large on-line and off-line merchants and businesses, other large Internet companies, financial institutions, and government institutions, have disclosed breaches of their information security systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks, including on portions of their websites or infrastructure. For example, in May 2014, eBay Inc. publicly announced that criminals were able to penetrate and steal certain data, including user names, encrypted user passwords and other non-financial user data, from certain of eBay's Marketplaces business unit databases, which led to eBay Marketplaces requiring a password reset and fewer eBay Marketplaces transactions using our PayPal services. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized, improper or illegal access to our systems, our data or customers' data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems are constantly evolving, may be difficult to detect quickly, and often are not recognized until launched against a target. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means, including, among others, hacking into the systems or facilities of us or our partners or customers, or attempting to fraudulently induce our employees, partners, customers or others into disclosing user names, passwords, payment card information, or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems. Certain efforts may be state-sponsored and supported by significant financial and technological resources, making them even more difficult to detect. As a result of our prominence, we believe that we are a particularly attractive target for such breaches and attacks. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and customer data and to prevent data loss and other security breaches, and expect to expend significant additional resources to bolster these protections, these security measures cannot provide absolute security, Our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyberattacks or security breaches, and third parties may be able to access our customers’ personal or proprietary information and payment card data that are stored on or accessible through those systems. Our security measures may also be breached due to employee error, malfeasance, system errors or vulnerabilities, or other irregularities. Any actual or perceived breach of our security could interrupt our operations; result in our systems or services being unavailable; result in improper disclosure of data; materially harm our reputation and brand; result in significant legal and financial exposure; lead to loss of customer confidence in, or decreased use of, our products and services; and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Any breaches of network or data security at our partners or customers could have similar effects. In addition, our customers could have vulnerabilities on their own computer systems that are entirely unrelated to our systems, but could mistakenly attribute their own vulnerabilities to PayPal.In addition, under payment card rules and our contracts with our card processors, if there is a breach of payment card information that we store, or that is stored by our direct payment card processing customers, we could be liable to the payment card issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses. We also expect to expend significant additional resources to protect against security or privacy breaches, and may be required to redress problems caused by breaches. Among other reasons, financial services regulators in various jurisdictions, including the United States and the European Union, have implemented or are considering proposals to impose new authentication requirements on banks and payment processors intended to reduce online fraud, which could impose significant costs, require us to change our business practices, make it more difficult for new customers to join PayPal, and reduce the ease of use of our products, which could harm our business. Additionally, our insurance policies carry low coverage limits, which may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches, and we may not be able to collect fully, if at all, under these insurance policies. 14 Table of Contents Systems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our websites, applications, products or services could harm our business. Our systems may experience service interruptions or degradation because of hardware and software defects or malfunctions, computer denial-of-service and other cyberattacks, human error, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, natural disasters, power losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist attacks, computer viruses or other malware, or other events. Our systems also may be subject to break-ins, sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. In addition, as a provider of payments solutions, we are subject to increased scrutiny by regulators that may require specific business continuity, resiliency and disaster recovery plans and more rigorous testing of such plans. This increased scrutiny may be costly and time-consuming and may divert our resources from other business priorities.We have experienced and will likely continue to experience system failures, denial of service attacks and other events or conditions from time to time that interrupt the availability or reduce or affect the speed or functionality of our products and services. These events have resulted and likely will result in loss of revenue. A prolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in the availability, speed or other functionality of our products and services could materially harm our business. Frequent or persistent interruptions in our services could cause current or potential customers to believe that our systems are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid our products and services, and could permanently harm our reputation and brands. Moreover, to the extent that any system failure or similar event results in damages to our customers or their businesses, these customers could seek significant compensation or contractual penalties from us for their losses and those claims, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and costly for us to address, and could have other consequences described in this “Risk Factors” section under the caption “Our business is subject to cyberattacks and security and privacy breaches.”Our Payments Platform has suffered significant intermittent unavailability. Reliability is particularly critical for us because the full-time availability of our PayPal products and services is critical to our goal of gaining widespread acceptance among consumers and merchants for digital and mobile payments. We have undertaken certain system upgrades and re-platforming efforts designed to improve our reliability and speed. These efforts are costly and time-consuming, involve significant technical risk and may divert our resources from new features and products, and there can be no guarantee that these efforts will succeed. Because we are a regulated financial institution in certain jurisdictions, frequent or persistent site interruptions could lead to regulatory scrutiny, significant fines and penalties, and mandatory and costly changes to our business practices, and ultimately could cause us to lose existing licenses that we need to operate or prevent or delay us from obtaining additional licenses that we need to expand our business.We also rely on facilities, components and services supplied by third parties, including eBay, and our business may be materially adversely affected to the extent these components or services do not meet our expectations or these third parties cease to provide the services or facilities. We do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for all losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of systems failures and similar events. 15 Table of Contents Changes to payment card networks or bank fees, rules, or practices could harm our business. We do not directly access the payment card networks, such as Visa and MasterCard, that enable our acceptance of credit cards and debit cards, including some types of prepaid cards. Accordingly, we must rely on banks or other payment processors to process transactions and must pay fees for the services. From time to time, payment card networks have increased, and may increase in the future, the interchange fees and assessments that they charge for each transaction which accesses their networks. Our payment card processors may have the right to pass any increases in interchange fees and assessments on to us as well as increase their own fees for processing. Any changes in interchange fees and assessments could increase our operating costs and reduce our operating income.In addition, in some jurisdictions, governments have required Visa and MasterCard to reduce interchange fees, or have opened investigations as to whether Visa’s or MasterCard’s interchange fees and practices violate antitrust law. In the United States, the Federal Reserve Board issued a final rule capping debit card interchange fees at significantly lower rates than Visa or MasterCard previously charged. In the European Union, the Multilateral Interchange Fee (“MIF”) Regulation limits credit and debit interchange fees for payments and imposes business rules on card processing services. Any material reduction in credit or debit card interchange rates in the United States or other markets could adversely affect our competitive position against traditional credit and debit card service providers, and may subject us to pricing pressure, although it would also lower our costs. Future changes to those regulations could potentially adversely affect our business.We are required by our processors to comply with payment card network operating rules, including special operating rules for payment service providers to merchants, and we have agreed to reimburse our processors for any fines they are assessed by payment card networks as a result of any rule violations by us or our merchants. The payment card networks set and interpret the card operating rules. From time to time, the networks have alleged that various aspects of our business model violate these operating rules. If such allegations are not resolved, they may result in material fines and penalties or require changes in our business practices that may be costly. The payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or re-interpret existing rules that we or our processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow, or costly to implement. As a result, we could lose our ability to give consumers the option of using payment cards to fund their payments or the choice of currency in which they would like their payment card to be charged. If we are unable to accept payment cards or are meaningfully limited in our ability to do so, our business would be adversely affected.We and our payment card processors have implemented specific business processes for merchants to comply with payment card network operating rules for providing services to merchants. Any failure to comply with these rules could result in fines. We are also subject to fines from payment card networks if we fail to detect that merchants are engaging in activities that are illegal or that are considered “high risk,” primarily the sale of certain types of digital content. For “high risk” merchants, we must either prevent such merchants from using our PayPal services or register such merchants with the payment card networks and conduct additional monitoring with respect to such merchants. Although the amount of these fines has not been material to date, additional fines in the future could become material and could result in a termination of our ability to accept payment cards or require changes in our process for registering new customers, which would materially harm our business. Payment card network rules may also increase the cost of, impose restrictions on, or otherwise negatively impact the development of, our retail point-of-sale solutions, which may negatively impact their deployment and adoption. Failure to deal effectively with fraud, fictitious transactions, bad transactions, and negative customer experiences would increase our loss rate and harm our business, and could severely diminish merchant and consumer confidence in and use of our services. We incur substantial losses due to claims from consumers that merchants have not performed or that their goods or services do not match the merchant’s description. We seek to recover such losses from the merchant, but may not be able to recover in full if the merchant is unwilling or unable to pay. We also incur losses from claims that the consumer did not authorize the purchase, from consumer fraud, from erroneous transmissions and from customers who have closed bank accounts or have insufficient funds in them to satisfy payments. In addition, if losses incurred by us related to payment card transactions become excessive, they could potentially result in our losing the right to accept payment cards for payment, which would harm our business. Our PayPal Credit products are similarly subject to the risk of fraudulent activity. We have taken measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud, but these measures need to be continually improved and may not be effective against new and continually evolving forms of fraud or in connection with new product offerings. If these measures do not succeed, our business could be harmed. 16 Table of Contents We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We have significant operations internationally that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar, subjecting us to foreign currency risk. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar versus the British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar, and Canadian Dollar impacts the translation of our net revenues generated in these foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar. Additionally, in connection with providing our services in multiple currencies, we set our foreign exchange rates twice per day. We may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the times that we set them. Given that we also hold some corporate and customer funds in non-U.S. currencies, our financial results are affected by the translation of these non-U.S. currencies into U.S. dollars. We also have foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. While we regularly enter into transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency translation and balance sheet exposure, it is impossible to predict or eliminate the effects of this exposure. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could significantly impact our financial results. Any factors that reduce cross-border trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business. Cross-border trade (i.e., transactions where the merchant or consumer were in different countries) is an important source of our revenue and profits. Cross-border transactions generally provide higher revenues and operating income than similar transactions that take place within a single country or market. Cross-border trade also represents our primary (and in some cases, our only) presence in certain important markets.Cross-border trade is subject to, and may be impacted by, foreign exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, the potential interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions (e.g., the jurisdiction of the merchant and of the consumer) are often extremely complicated in the context of cross-border trade. The interpretation and/or application of such laws could impose additional requirements (which may impose conflicting obligations) and restrictions on cross-border trade. Any factors that increase the costs of cross-border trade or restrict, delay, or make cross-border trade more difficult or impractical would lower our revenues and profits and could harm our business. Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight, as well as extensive, complex, overlapping and frequently changing rules, regulations and legal interpretations. Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight. For a discussion of how government regulation impacts key aspects of our business, please see Item I - “Business—Government Regulation” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our business is also subject to laws, rules, regulations, policies and legal interpretations in the markets in which we operate, including (but not limited to) those governing banking, credit, deposit taking, cross-border and domestic money transmission, foreign exchange, privacy, data protection, banking secrecy, payment services (including payment processing and settlement services), consumer protection, anti-money laundering, and counter-terrorist financing. The legal and regulatory requirements applicable to us are extensive, complex, frequently changing, and increasing in number, and may impose overlapping and/or conflicting requirements or obligations. Financial and political events have increased the level of regulatory scrutiny on the payments industry, and regulatory agencies may view matters or interpret laws and regulations differently than they have in the past and in a manner adverse to our business. Our success and increased visibility may result in increased regulatory oversight and tighter enforcement of rules and regulations that may apply to our business.As we expand and localize our international activities, we are increasingly becoming obligated to comply with the laws of the countries or markets in which we operate. In addition, because our services are accessible worldwide and we facilitate sales of goods and provide services to customers worldwide, one or more jurisdictions may claim that we or our customers are required to comply with their laws. Laws regulating the Internet, mobile and related technologies outside of the United States often impose different, more specific, or even conflicting obligations on us , as well as broader liability. For example, certain transactions that may be permissible in a local jurisdiction may be prohibited by regulations of U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) or U.S. anti-money laundering or counter-terrorist financing regulations. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or new laws and regulations (including changes to or expansion of the interpretation of those laws and regulations), including those discussed in this risk factor, may subject us to significant fines, penalties, criminal and civil lawsuits, forfeiture of significant assets, and other enforcement actions in one or more jurisdictions; result in additional compliance and licensure requirements; increase regulatory scrutiny of our business; restrict our operations; force us to change our business practices, make product or operational changes or delay planned product launches or improvements. The foregoing could, individually or in the aggregate, expose us to significant liability, impose significant costs, require us to expend substantial resources, increase the cost and complexity of compliance, damage our brand and business, make our products and services less attractive, result in the loss of customers, limit our ability to grow the business, adversely affect our results of operations, and harm our reputation. The complexity of U.S. federal and state regulatory and enforcement regimes, coupled with the global scope of our operations and the evolving global regulatory environment, could result in a single event giving rise to a large number of overlapping investigations and legal and regulatory proceedings by multiple government authorities in different jurisdictions. We have implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws, and regulations, but there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations. 17 Table of Contents Payments Regulation In the United States, PayPal, Inc. has obtained licenses to operate as a money transmitter (or its equivalent) in the states where it is required, as well as in the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. This license includes not only the PayPal branded products and services in these states, but also our Venmo branded products and services. Our subsidiary, Xoom, is also licensed as a money transmitter in certain U.S. states. As licensed money transmitters, PayPal and Xoom are subject to restrictions with respect to their investment of customer funds, reporting requirements, bonding requirements and inspection by state regulatory agencies. Accordingly, if we violate these laws or regulations, we could be subject to liability and/or additional restrictions, forced to cease doing business with residents of certain states, forced to change our business practices or be required to obtain additional licenses or regulatory approvals that could impose substantial costs.While we currently allow our consumers with credit cards to send payments from approximately 200 markets, we allow customers in only approximately half of those markets (including the United States) to also receive payments, in some cases with significant restrictions on the manner in which customers can withdraw funds. These limitations may affect our ability to grow our business in these markets. Of the markets whose residents can use our PayPal services, approximately 30 markets are in member states of the European Union. We provide our services to customers in the European Union through PayPal (Europe) S.à r.l. et Cie, SCA (“PayPal (Europe)”), our wholly-owned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a bank in Luxembourg. Accordingly, PayPal (Europe) is subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if it violates the disclosure, reporting, anti-money-laundering, capitalization, fund management, corporate governance, privacy, data protection, information security, banking secrecy, taxation, sanctions, or other requirements imposed on Luxembourg banks. In addition, European Union laws and regulations are typically subject to different and potentially inconsistent interpretations by the countries that are members of the European Union, which can make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage.In Australia, we serve our customers through PayPal Australia Pty. Ltd. (“PayPal Australia”), which is licensed by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission as a provider of a non-cash payment product and by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority as a purchased payment facility provider, which is a type of authorized depository institution. Accordingly, PayPal Australia is subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if it violates the product disclosure, reporting, anti-money laundering, capitalization, privacy, corporate governance or other requirements imposed on Australian depository institutions.In many of the other markets in which we do business, including Canada and a number of markets in Asia, Central America and South America, we serve our customers through PayPal Pte. Ltd., our wholly-owned subsidiary that is based in Singapore. PayPal Pte. Ltd. is supervised by the Monetary Authority of Singapore and is designated as a holder of a stored value facility and does not hold a remittance license. As a result, PayPal Pte. Ltd. is not able to offer outbound remittance payments (including donations to charities) from Singapore, and can only offer payments for the purchase of goods and services in Singapore. In many of the markets (other than Singapore) served by PayPal Pte. Ltd., it is unclear and uncertain whether our Singapore-based service is subject only to Singapore law or, if it is subject to the application of local laws, whether such local laws would require a payment processor like us to be licensed as a payments service, bank, financial institution or otherwise.We are also subject to regulation in other markets in which we do business and we have been and expect to continue to be required to apply for various licenses, certifications and regulatory approvals in a number of the countries where we provide our services. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such licenses. Even if we were able to obtain such licenses, there are substantial costs and potential product changes involved in maintaining such licenses, and we could be subject to fines or other enforcement action if we are found to violate disclosure, reporting, anti-money laundering, capitalization, corporate governance or other requirements of such licenses. These factors could impose substantial additional costs and involve considerable delay to the development or provision of our products in certain countries.In many other countries it may not be clear whether we are required to be licensed as a payment services provider, bank, financial institution or otherwise. In such markets, we may rely on local banks to process payments and conduct foreign exchange in local currency. Local regulators may use their power to slow or halt payments to local merchants conducted through the local bank. Such regulatory actions or the need to obtain licenses, certifications or other regulatory approvals could impose substantial costs and involve considerable delay to the provision or development of our services in a given market, or could require significant and costly operational changes or prevent us from providing any services in a given market. 18 Table of Contents Consumer Protection We are subject to consumer protection laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. The financial services sector has been increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny. In the U.S., we have been, and we expect that we will continue to be, required to make additional disclosures to our consumers and to comply with new restrictions and requirements on our activities. Among other things, our services are subject to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Regulation E issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). Under such regulations, among other things, we are required to provide advance disclosure of changes to our services, to follow specified error resolution procedures and to reimburse consumers for losses from certain transactions not authorized by the consumer. Additionally, even technical violations of these laws can result in assessment of actual damages or statutory damages or penalties of up to $1,000 in individual cases or up to $500,000 per violation in any class action and treble damages in some instances, and we could also be liable for plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees. We are subject to, and have paid amounts in settlement of, lawsuits containing allegations that our business violated the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Regulation E or otherwise advance claims for relief relating to our business practices (e.g., that we improperly held consumer funds or otherwise improperly limited consumer accounts). In January 2012, the CFPB finalized rules under Regulation E, mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act, which required us, beginning in October 2013, to provide additional disclosures, error resolution rights, and cancellation rights to U.S. consumers who make international remittance payments. In November 2014, the CFPB proposed a new prepaid account rule that would apply to prepaid cards, mobile wallets and potentially PayPal accounts. In December 2014, we became subject to CFPB supervision and examination pursuant to a new regulation that allows the CFPB to supervise all companies, including PayPal, that provide more than one million international remittance transfers per year. Under the regulation, CFPB examiners are now able to examine us for compliance with the remittance transfer rule and other laws and regulations. These and other rules promulgated by the CFPB could increase our costs and require us to expend substantial resources and make changes to our business practices. In May 2015, we entered into a Stipulated Final Judgment and Consent Order (\"Consent Order\") with the CFPB in which we settled regulatory claims arising from PayPal Credit practices between 2011 and 2015. The Consent Order included obligations on PayPal to pay $15 million in redress to consumers and a $10 million civil monetary penalty, and required PayPal to make various changes to the PayPal Credit disclosures and related business practices. We continue to cooperate and engage with the CFPB and work to ensure compliance with the Consent Order, which may result in us incurring additional costs associated with compliance or redress. PayPal (Europe) offers its services in European Union countries through a “passport” notification process through the Luxembourg regulator to regulators in other European Union member states pursuant to European Union Directives, and has completed the “passport” notification process in all European Union member countries. The regulators in these countries could notify PayPal (Europe) of local consumer protection laws that apply to its business, in addition to Luxembourg consumer protection law, and could also seek to persuade the Luxembourg regulator to order PayPal (Europe) to conduct its activities in the local country through a branch office. These or similar actions by these regulators could increase the cost of, or delay, our plans for expanding our business in European Union countries. In addition, the countries that are members of the European Union may each have different and potentially inconsistent interpretations of regulations implementing the European Union Payment Services Directive, which could make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage. The European Commission has proposed revisions to the Payments Services and Anti-Money Laundering Directives, which could make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage. Finally, if the assets of PayPal (Europe) exceed certain thresholds, or if the European Central Bank (\"ECB\") determines that PayPal (Europe) is a significant supervised entity or that some activity of PayPal (Europe) is subject to oversight by the ECB, PayPal (Europe) or certain of its activities could become directly regulated by the ECB in addition to the Luxembourg regulator, the Commission de surveillance du secteur financier, as our national supervisor, which could subject us to additional requirements and would likely increase compliance costs. 19 Table of Contents Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing We are subject to various anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws and regulations around the world that prohibit, among other things, our involvement in transferring the proceeds of criminal activities. We routinely report to the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"OFAC\") on payments we have rejected or blocked pursuant to OFAC sanctions regulations and on any possible violations of those regulations. In March 2015, we reached a settlement with OFAC regarding possible violations arising from our practices between 2009 and 2013. In addition, we continue to cooperate with OFAC regarding other transactions that could also possibly be in violation of OFAC sanctions regulations. In addition, we continue to cooperate with OFAC regarding other transactions that we have self-reported could also possibly be in violation of OFAC sanctions regulations. Subsequent to our March 2015 settlement, we have received new subpoenas from OFAC seeking additional information about certain of these transactions. Such self-reported transactions could result in claims or actions against us including litigation, injunctions, damage awards, fines or penalties, or require us to change our business practices that could result in a material loss, require significant management time, result in the diversion of significant operational resources or otherwise harm our business. Violation of OFAC sanctions regulations that OFAC determines to be egregious can result in statutory penalties of up to $250,000 per transaction. For a discussion of our dealings with OFAC, please see “Note 11: Commitments and Contingencies - Litigation and Regulatory Matters.”U.S. and other regulators globally continue to increase their scrutiny of compliance with these obligations, which may require us to further revise or expand our compliance program, including the procedures we use to verify the identity of our customers and to monitor international and domestic transactions. Many countries in which we operate also have anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws and regulations, and we have been and continue to be required to make changes to our compliance program in various jurisdictions in response. Regulators regularly re-examine the transaction volume thresholds at which we must obtain and keep applicable records or verify identities of customers and any change in such thresholds could result in greater costs for compliance. Privacy and Protection of User Data We are subject to a number of laws, rules and directives (which we refer to as \"privacy laws\") relating to the collection, use, retention, security, processing and transfer (which we refer to as \"process\") of personally identifiable information about our customers and employees (sometimes called personal data) in the countries where we operate. Much of the personal information that we process, especially financial information, is regulated by multiple privacy laws and, in some cases, the privacy laws of multiple jurisdictions. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between or among us, our subsidiaries, and other parties with which we have commercial relationships. The European Court of Justice in the Schrems case has ruled that the U.S.-E.U. Safe Harbor framework clauses, one compliance method by which companies could transfer personal data regarding citizens of the European Union to the United States, could no longer be relied upon. The potential impact of this ruling is subject to further determination and additional developments, including the potential development of a new form of Safe Harbor framework or a requirement to find alternative bases for the compliant transfer of personal data from the E.U. to the U.S. PayPal, Inc. has not relied on the Safe Harbor framework for the transfer of E.U. personal data to the United States. Rather, when our company was a subsidiary of eBay Inc., we relied on binding corporate rules that permitted such transfers; upon separation from eBay, we have continued to operate under these same binding corporate rules pending the approval of our application for our own independent binding corporate rules. While PayPal, Inc. has not relied on the Safe Harbor framework, some of our data processing subsidiaries, service providers, customers or other business partners do. In addition, because PayPal (Europe) is headquartered in Luxembourg and subject to regulation as a bank in that jurisdiction, we have relied on the “one-stop-shop” concept under which Luxembourg has been our lead data protection regulator in the E.U. However, a recent European Court of Justice ruling (Weltimmo) affecting companies that do business in the E.U. potentially could make us subject to the local data protection laws or regulatory enforcement activities of the various E.U. member states in which we have established legal entities. Regulatory scrutiny of privacy, data protection, collection, use and sharing of data is increasing on a global basis. There is uncertainty associated with the legal and regulatory environment around privacy and data protection laws, which continue to develop in ways we cannot predict. Privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and impose inconsistent or conflicting requirements. Complying with varying jurisdictional requirements could increase the costs and complexity of compliance or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business, and violations of privacy and data protection-related laws can result in significant penalties and damage to our brand and business. In addition, compliance with inconsistent privacy laws may restrict our ability to provide services to our customers. A determination that there have been violations of laws of privacy or data protection laws could expose us to significant damage awards, fines and other penalties that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business and reputation. In addition, because of the large number of text messages, emails, phone calls and other communications we send or make to our customers for various business purposes, communication-related privacy laws that provide a specified monetary damage award or fine for each violation could result in particularly significant damage awards or fines. For example, under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (\"TCPA\"), in the U.S., plaintiffs may seek actual monetary loss or statutory damages of $500 per violation, whichever is greater, and courts may treble the damage award for willful or knowing violations. We have been and may be subject to lawsuits (including class-action lawsuits) containing allegations that our business violated the TCPA. These lawsuits seek damages (including statutory damages) and injunctive relief, among other remedies. Given the large number of communications we send to our customers, a determination that there have been violations of the TCPA or other communications-based statutes could expose us to significant damage awards that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business.We post on our websites our privacy policies and practices including concerning the collection, use and disclosure of user data. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any applicable regulatory requirements or orders, or privacy, data protection, information security or consumer protection-related privacy laws and regulations in one or more jurisdictions could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, including class action privacy litigation in certain jurisdictions, subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments and negative publicity, require us to change our business practices, increase the costs and complexity of compliance, and adversely affect our business. Data protection, privacy and information security have become the subject of increasing public, media and legislative concern. If our customers were to reduce their use of our products and services as a result of these concerns, our business could be harmed. As noted above, we are also subject to the possibility of security and privacy breaches, which themselves may result in a violation of these privacy laws. 20 Table of Contents PayPal is not a bank or licensed lender in the United States and relies upon third parties to make loans and provide other products critical to our business. As PayPal is neither a chartered financial institution nor licensed to make loans in any state, we rely on a third party chartered financial institution to issue the PayPal Credit consumer product in the United States, and a different chartered financial institution to issue the PayPal Working Capital product in the United States. Both of these chartered financial institutions are industrial banks chartered by the State of Utah. In the event of a termination or interruption in the ability of the chartered financial institution that currently issues the PayPal Credit consumer product in the United States to lend under the PayPal Credit consumer product, our chartered financial institution that issues the PayPal Working Capital product in the U.S. has agreed to take ownership of (and originate loans with respect to) all consumer accounts. Nevertheless, any termination or interruption of either bank’s ability to lend could result in the inability to originate any new PayPal Credit or PayPal Working Capital loans. In the event of either bank’s inability to lend, we would either need to reach a similar agreement with another chartered financial institution or obtain our own bank charter or licenses. We may be unable to reach a similar agreement with another partner on favorable terms or at all, and obtaining a bank charter or lending licenses would be a time-consuming and costly process and would subject us to additional laws and regulatory requirements, which could be burdensome and increase our costs. In addition, our commercial relationships with third parties which are federally supervised U.S. financial institutions could subject us to examination by their federal banking regulators with respect to certain services that we provide. Our credit products expose us to additional risks. Our PayPal Credit and PayPal Working Capital products are offered to a wide range of consumers and merchants, and the financial success of these products depends on the effective management of the risk related to these products. The lender for the PayPal Credit product extends credit using proprietary segmentation and credit algorithms and other analytical techniques designed to analyze the credit risk of specific consumers based on their past purchasing and payment history as well as their credit scores. Similarly, to assess a merchant who wishes to obtain a PayPal Working Capital advance, among other indicators, the lender applies a proprietary risk model to help predict the merchant's ability to repay the working capital advance. These risk models may not accurately predict the creditworthiness of a consumer or merchant due to inaccurate assumptions about the particular consumer or merchant or the economic environment or limited product history, among other factors. The accuracy of these risk models and the ability of the lender and our ability to manage credit risk related to our PayPal Credit and PayPal Working Capital products may also be affected by legal or regulatory changes (e.g., bankruptcy laws and minimum payment regulations), competitors’ actions, changes in consumer behavior, changes in the economic environment and other factors. Like other businesses with significant exposure to losses from consumer credit, we face the risk that PayPal Credit consumer account holders will default on their payment obligation, making the receivables uncollectible and creating the risk of potential charge-offs. The non-payment rate among account holders may increase due to, among other things, changes to underwriting standards, worsening economic conditions, such as a recession or greater austerity in various countries, and high unemployment rates. Account holders who miss payments often fail to repay their loans, and account holders who file for protection under the bankruptcy laws generally do not repay their loans.We purchase receivables related to PayPal Credit and PayPal Working Capital products. If we are unable to fund our purchase of these receivables adequately or in a cost-effective manner, or if we are unable to efficiently manage the cash resources utilized for these purposes, our business could be harmed.Our international expansion of our PayPal Credit product offerings exposes us to additional risks, including those discussed below under the risk factor titled “Our international operations are subject to increased risks, which could harm our business.” 21 Table of Contents We are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates. We are exposed to interest rate risk from our investment portfolio and from interest-rate sensitive assets underlying the customer balances we hold on our balance sheet as customer accounts. The assets underlying our customer balances we hold on our balance sheet as customer accounts are maintained in interest and non-interest bearing bank deposits, time deposits, corporate debt securities and U.S. and foreign government and agency securities. We seek to preserve principal while holding eligible liquid assets, as defined by applicable regulatory requirements and commercial law in jurisdictions in which we operate, equal to at least 100% of the aggregate amount of all customer balances. We do not pay interest on amounts due to customers. In addition, fluctuations in interest rates may adversely impact our customers’ spending levels and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amounts owed to us. Higher interest rates often lead to higher payment obligations by customers to us and other lenders under mortgage, credit card and other consumer loans, which may reduce our customers’ ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore lead to increased delinquencies, charge-offs and allowance for loan and interest receivable which could have an adverse effect on our net income.In July 2015, we entered into a revolving credit facility. As a result, we will be exposed to fluctuations in interest rates to the extent of our borrowings under the facility, which bear interest at a floating rate. Changes to our buyer and seller protection programs could increase our loss rate. Our buyer and seller protection programs protect merchants and consumers from fraudulent transactions. In 2015, we increased the scope of our buyer protection program to cover digital goods and intangible goods and services. In addition, consumers who pay through PayPal may have reimbursement rights from their payment card issuer (usually a bank), which in turn will seek recovery from us. The risk of losses from our buyer and seller protection programs are specific to individual buyers, sellers and transactions, and may also be impacted by regional variations to these programs, modifications to these programs resulting from changes in regulatory requirements, or changes that we decide to implement, such as expanding the scope of transactions covered by one or more of these programs. Upon PayPal becoming an independent publicly-traded company on July 17, 2015 through the distribution of 100 percent of the outstanding capital stock of PayPal to eBay’s stockholders, which we refer to as the distribution, we extended our protection programs in several countries to cover certain customers’ purchases on eBay, and our costs associated with these programs have therefore increased. Increases in our loss rate, including as a result of changing our buyer and seller protection programs, could harm our business. Our international operations are subject to increased risks, which could harm our business. Our international operations, especially in European Union countries (in particular, United Kingdom and Germany) and China, have generated approximately one-half of our net revenues in recent years. In addition to uncertainty about our ability to generate revenues from our foreign operations and expand into international markets, and the foreign currency risks discussed earlier in this “Risk Factors” section under the caption “We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates,” there are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:•expenses associated with localizing our products and services and customer data, including offering customers the ability to transact business in the local currency and adapting our products and services to local preferences (e.g., payment methods) with which we may have limited or no experience;•trade barriers and changes in trade regulations;•difficulties in developing, staffing, and simultaneously managing a large number of varying foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences;•stringent local labor laws and regulations;•credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;•profit repatriation restrictions, foreign currency exchange restrictions or extreme fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for a particular currency;•political or social unrest, economic instability, repression, or human rights issues;•geopolitical events, including natural disasters, public health issues, acts of war, and terrorism;•import or export regulations;•compliance with U.S. laws and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, and other local anticorruption laws; •compliance with U.S. and foreign laws designed to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities; •antitrust and competition regulations;•potentially adverse tax developments and consequences;•economic uncertainties relating to sovereign and other debt;•different, uncertain, or more stringent user protection, data protection, privacy, and other laws;•risks related to other government regulation or required compliance with local laws;•risks related to multiple overlapping legal or regulatory regimes, which may impose conflicting requirements on us;•national or regional differences in macroeconomic growth rates;•local licensing and reporting obligations; and•increased difficulties in collecting accounts receivable.Violations of the complex foreign and U.S. laws, rules and regulations that apply to our international operations may result in fines, criminal actions, or sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws, violations by our employees, contractors, or agents could nevertheless occur. These risks are inherent in our international operations and expansion, may increase our costs of doing business internationally, and could harm our business. 22 Table of Contents Use of our payments services for illegal purposes could harm our business. Our payment system is susceptible to potentially illegal or improper uses, including money laundering, terrorist financing, illegal online gambling, fraudulent sales of goods or services, illicit sales of prescription medications or controlled substances, piracy of software, movies, music, and other copyrighted or trademarked goods (in particular, digital goods), money laundering, bank fraud, child pornography trafficking, prohibited sales of alcoholic beverages or tobacco products, online securities fraud, or to facilitate other illegal activity. Certain activity that may be legal in one country may be illegal in another country, and a merchant may intentionally or inadvertently be found responsible for importing illegal goods, creating liability to us. Changes in law have increased the penalties for intermediaries providing payment services for certain illegal activities and additional payments-related proposals are under active consideration by government authorities. Intellectual property rights owners or government authorities may seek to bring legal action against providers of payments solutions, including PayPal, that are peripherally involved in the sale of infringing items. Any resulting claims could result in reputational harm and any resulting liabilities, loss of transaction volume or increased costs could harm our business. Our failure to manage the assets underlying our customer funds properly could harm our business. Our ability to manage and account accurately for the assets underlying our customer funds requires a high level of internal controls. As our business continues to grow and we expand our product offerings, we must continue to strengthen our associated internal controls. Our success requires significant public confidence in our ability to handle large and growing transaction volumes and amounts of customer funds. Any failure to maintain the necessary controls or to manage the assets underlying our customer funds accurately could result in reputational harm, lead customers to discontinue or reduce their use of our products and result in significant penalties and fines, which could harm our business. We are subject to regulatory activity and antitrust litigation under competition laws. We are subject to scrutiny by various government agencies under U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including antitrust and competition laws. An increasing number of jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. Other companies and government agencies have in the past and may in the future allege that our actions violate the antitrust or competition laws of the United States, individual states, other countries, or the European Commission, or otherwise constitute unfair competition. An increasing number of governments are regulating competition law activities, including increased scrutiny in large markets such as China. Our business agreements or arrangements with customers or other companies could give rise to regulatory action or antitrust litigation. Some regulators, particularly those outside of the United States, may perceive our business to be used so broadly that otherwise uncontroversial business practices could be deemed anticompetitive. Any claims or investigations, even if without foundation, may be very expensive to defend or respond to, involve negative publicity and substantial diversion of management time and effort and could result in significant judgments against us or require us to change our business practices. 23 Table of Contents We are subject to patent litigation. We have repeatedly been sued for allegedly infringing other parties’ patents. At any given time, we are typically a defendant in a number of patent lawsuits and have been notified of several other potential patent disputes. We expect that we will increasingly be subject to patent infringement claims because, among other reasons:•our products and services continue to expand in scope and complexity;•we continue to expand into new business areas, including through acquisitions; and•the number of patent owners who may claim that we, any of the companies that we have acquired, or our customers infringe their patents, and the aggregate number of patents controlled by such patent owners, continues to increase.Such claims may be brought directly against us and/or against our customers whom we may indemnify either because we are contractually obligated to do so or we choose to do so as a business matter. We believe that an increasing number of these claims against us and other technology companies have been, and continue to be, initiated by third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims. In addition, we have seen significant patent disputes between operating companies in some technology industries. Patent claims, whether meritorious or not, are time-consuming and costly to defend and resolve, and could require us to make expensive changes in our methods of doing business, enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements, make substantial payments to satisfy adverse judgments or settle claims or proceedings, or cease conducting certain operations, which would harm our business. We may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or third parties may allege that we are infringing their intellectual property rights. We believe the protection of our intellectual property, including our trademarks, patents, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, and trade secrets, is critical to our success. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on applicable laws and regulations in the United States and internationally, as well as a variety of administrative procedures. We also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights when offering or procuring products and services, including confidentiality and invention assignment agreements entered into with our employees and contractors and confidentiality agreements with parties with whom we conduct business.Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are made available, and contractual arrangements and other steps that we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our intellectual property or deter independent development of equivalent or superior intellectual property rights by others. We must protect our intellectual property rights, including our trademarks, patents, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, and other proprietary rights in an increasing number of jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and time-consuming. We may not be successful in protecting or enforcing our rights in every jurisdiction. Also, we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. We have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to others. These licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation. Any failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or significant costs incurred in doing so, could materially harm our business.As the number of products in the software industry increases and the functionality of these products further overlaps, and as we acquire technology through acquisitions or licenses, we may become increasingly subject to intellectual property infringement and other claims. Litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of the patent and other intellectual property rights of others. The ultimate outcome of any allegation is uncertain and, regardless of the outcome, any such claim, with or without merit, may be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert management’s time and attention from our business, and require us to, among other things, stop providing transaction processing and other payment related services or redesign, stop selling our products or services, pay substantial amounts to satisfy judgments or settle claims or lawsuits, pay substantial royalty or licensing fees, or satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with certain parties with whom we have commercial relationships. Our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights, or litigation or claims arising out of intellectual property matters, may harm our business. 24 Table of Contents We are regularly subject to general litigation, regulatory disputes, and government inquiries. We are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits (including class actions and individual lawsuits), government and regulatory investigations, and other proceedings involving competition and antitrust law, intellectual property, privacy, data protection, information security, consumer protection, accessibility claims, securities, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, services, escheatment of unclaimed or abandoned property, and other matters. In particular, our business faces ongoing consumer protection and intellectual property litigation, as discussed above. The number and significance of these disputes and inquiries have increased as our company has grown larger, our business has expanded in scope and geographic reach, and our products and services have increased in complexity. In addition, the laws, rules and regulations affecting our business, including those pertaining to Internet and mobile commerce, payments services, and credit, are subject to ongoing interpretation by the courts and governmental authorities, and the resulting uncertainty in the scope and application of these laws, rules and regulations increases the risk that we will be subject to private claims and governmental actions alleging violations of those laws, rules and regulations. The scope, outcome and impact of claims, lawsuits, government investigations, and proceedings that we are subject to cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of the outcome, such investigations and proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. Determining reserves for our pending litigation is a complex, fact-intensive process that is subject to management’s judgment. Resolving one or more such legal and regulatory proceedings could potentially require us to make substantial payments to satisfy judgments, fines or penalties or to settle claims or proceedings, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business. These proceedings could also result in reputational harm, criminal sanctions, consent decrees, or orders preventing us from offering certain products or services, requiring a change in our business practices in costly ways or development of non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies. Any of these consequences could materially and adversely affect our business.Certain of our customer agreements contain arbitration provisions with class action waiver provisions that may limit our exposure to consumer class action litigation, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in enforcing these arbitration provisions, or the class action waiver provisions in them, in the future or in any given case. Legislative, administrative or regulatory developments may directly or indirectly prohibit or limit the use of pre-dispute arbitration clauses and class action waiver provisions. Any such prohibitions or limitations on or discontinuation of the use of such arbitration or class action waiver provisions could subject us to additional lawsuits, including additional consumer class action litigation, or materially impact our ability to avoid exposure from consumer class action litigation. We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities. The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation and significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Like many other multinational corporations, we are subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Our determination of our tax liability is always subject to audit and review by applicable domestic and foreign tax authorities, and we are currently undergoing a number of investigations, audits and reviews by taxing authorities throughout the world, including with respect to our tax structure. Any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could have a negative effect on our business and the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the periods for which such determination is made. While we have established reserves based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventualities, these reserves may prove to be insufficient.In addition, our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated (or by the incurrence of losses) in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, as a result of gains on our foreign exchange risk management program, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items.In light of continuing global fiscal challenges, various levels of government and international organizations such as the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and European Union (EU) are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative or regulatory action to increase tax revenue. These tax reform efforts are designed to ensure that corporate entities are taxed on a larger percentage of their earnings. Any such tax reform or other legislative or regulatory actions to increase tax revenue could increase our effective tax rate. We and our merchants may be subject to sales reporting and record-keeping obligations. One or more states or the federal government or foreign countries may seek to impose reporting or record-keeping obligations on companies that engage in or facilitate ecommerce. Such an obligation could be imposed by legislation intended to improve tax compliance (and legislation to such effect has been contemplated by several additional states and is in the process of being implemented by a number of foreign jurisdictions) or if one of our companies was deemed to be the legal agent of our merchants by a jurisdiction in which it operates. We have modified our software to meet these requirements and expect increased operational costs and changes to our customer experience in connection with complying with these reporting obligations. Any failure by us to comply with these and similar reporting and record-keeping obligations could result in substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions and could harm our business. 25 Table of Contents Acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic investments could result in operating difficulties and could harm our business. We have acquired a significant number of businesses, technologies, services, and products. We expect to continue to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions as part of our overall business strategy, including business combinations, acquisitions, and dispositions of certain businesses, technologies, services, products, and other assets, as well as strategic investments and joint ventures. These transactions may involve significant challenges and risks, including:•the potential loss of key customers, vendors and other key business partners of the companies we acquire, or dispose of, following and continuing after announcement of our transaction plans;•declining employee morale and retention issues affecting employees of companies that we acquire or dispose of, which may result from changes in compensation, management, reporting relationships, future prospects, or the direction of the acquired or disposed business;•difficulty making strategic hires of new employees;•diversion of management time and a shift of focus from operating the business to the transaction, and in the case of an acquisition, integration and administration;•the need to integrate the operations, systems (including accounting, management, information, compliance, human resource and other administrative systems), technologies, products and personnel of each acquired company, which is an inherently risky and potentially lengthy and costly process;•the inefficiencies and lack of control that may result if such integration is delayed or not implemented, and unforeseen difficulties and expenditures that may arise as a result;•the need to implement or improve controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at companies that, prior to acquisition, may have lacked such controls, procedures and policies or whose controls, procedures and policies did not meet applicable legal and other standards;•potential exposure to new or increased regulatory oversight associated with new lines of business;•risks associated with our expansion into new international markets;•lawsuits resulting from the acquisition;•liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including intellectual property and other litigation claims or disputes, violations of laws, rules and regulations, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities;•the potential loss of key employees following the transaction;•the acquisition of new customer and employee personal information, which in and of itself may require regulatory approval and or additional controls, policies and procedures and subject us to additional exposure and additional complexity and costs of compliance; and•our dependence on the acquired business’ accounting, financial reporting, operating metrics and similar systems, controls and processes and the risk that errors or irregularities in those systems, controls and processes will lead to errors in our financial statements or make it more difficult to manage the acquired business.At any given time we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more of these types of transactions and any of these transactions could, individually or in the aggregate, be material to our financial condition and results of operations. It may take us longer than expected to fully realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions, and those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Any acquisitions or dispositions may also require us to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt (and increased interest expense), liabilities, and amortization expenses related to intangible assets or write-offs of goodwill, which could adversely affect our results of operations and dilute the economic and voting rights of our stockholders.We may make certain investments, including through joint ventures, in which we have a minority equity interest and/or lack management and operational control. Under such circumstances, the controlling joint venture partner in a joint venture investment may have business interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours, and business decisions or other actions or omissions of the controlling investor, joint venture partner or joint venture company may result in reputational harm or adversely affect the value of our investment. 26 Table of Contents We are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our services. Companies providing online services may be subject to claims relating to information disseminated through their services, including claims alleging defamation, libel, breach of contract, invasion of privacy, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, among other things. The laws relating to the liability of companies providing online services for information disseminated through their services are subject to frequent challenges both in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. We are also subject to potential liability to third parties for the customer-provided content on our sites, particularly in jurisdictions outside the United States where the applicable laws are unsettled. If we become liable for information provided by our customers and carried on our service, we could be directly harmed and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability, including expending substantial resources or discontinuing certain service offerings, which could harm our business. Problems with or price increases by third parties who provide services to us or to our customers could harm our business. A number of third parties provide services to us or to our customers. As discussed in this Risk Factors section under the caption “Changes to payment card networks or bank fees, rules, or practices could harm our business,” we are dependent on banks and other payment processors that link us to the payment card and bank clearing networks to process transactions. We rely on unaffiliated third party lenders to make the consumer and other loans originated through the PayPal Credit and PayPal Working Capital products. We also rely heavily on third parties to operate our services, including merchant processors and payment gateways to process transactions and third parties that provide loan receivable tracking and customer statements processing. Financial or regulatory issues, labor issues, or other problems that prevent these companies from providing services to us or our customers could harm our business. We have outsourced certain functions to third-party providers, including some customer support and product development functions, which are critical to our operations. If our service providers do not perform satisfactorily, our operations could be disrupted, which could result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business.Price increases or financial penalties by, or service terminations, disruptions or interruptions at, companies that provide services to us and our customers and clients could also make it more difficult for our merchants to complete transactions, thereby harming our business. Some third parties who provide services to us may have or gain market power and be able to increase their prices to us without competitive constraint. In addition, there can be no assurance that third parties who provide services directly to us or our customers will continue to do so on acceptable terms, or at all. If any third parties were to stop providing services to us or our customers on acceptable terms, including as a result of bankruptcy, we may be unable to procure alternatives from other third parties in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all. Our developer platforms, which are open to merchants and third-party developers, subject us to additional risks. We provide third-party developers with access to application programming interfaces, software development kits and other tools designed to allow them to produce applications for use, with a particular focus on mobile applications. There can be no assurance that merchants or third-party developers will develop and maintain applications and services on our open platforms on a timely basis or at all, and a number of factors could cause such third-party developers to curtail or stop development for our platforms. In addition, our business is subject to many regulatory restrictions. It is possible that merchants and third-party developers who utilize our development platforms or tools could violate these regulatory restrictions and we may be held responsible for such violations, which could harm our business. Our retail point of sale solutions expose us to additional risks. We have announced several retail point of sale solutions, which enable merchants to accept payments using a payments card reader attached to, or otherwise communicating with, a mobile device or to scan payment cards and codes using the mobile device’s embedded camera, and which enable consumers to use their mobile devices to pay at the point of sale. As we continue to expand our product and service offerings at the retail point of sale, we will face additional risks, including:•increased expectations from offline retailers regarding the reliability and availability of our systems and services and correspondingly lower amounts of downtime, which we may not be able to meet;•significant competition at the retail point of sale, particularly from established payment card providers such as Visa, MasterCard and American Express, many of which have substantially greater resources than we do;•increased targeting by fraudsters; given that our fraud models are less developed in this area, we may experience increases in fraud and associated transaction losses as we adjust to fraudulent activity at the point of sale;•exposure to product liability claims to the extent that hardware devices that we produce for use at the retail point of sale malfunction or are not in compliance with laws, which could result in substantial liability and require product recalls or other actions;•exposure to additional laws, rules and regulations;•increased reliance on third parties involved with processing in-store payments, including independent software providers, electronic point of sale providers, hardware providers (such as cash register and pin-pad providers), payment processors and banks that enable in-store transactions; and•lower operating income than our other payment solutions.Unless we are able to successfully manage these risks, including driving adoption of, and significant volume through, our retail point of sale solutions over time, our business may be harmed. 27 Table of Contents Our success largely depends on key personnel. Because competition for our key employees is intense, we may not be able to attract, retain, and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our business. The loss of senior management or other key personnel could harm our business. Our future performance depends substantially on the continued services of our senior management and other key personnel, including engineering and product development personnel, and our ability to attract, retain, and motivate such personnel. Competition for key personnel is intense, especially in the Silicon Valley where our corporate headquarters are located, and we may be unable to successfully attract, integrate, or retain sufficiently qualified key personnel. In making employment decisions, particularly in high-technology and payments industries, job candidates often consider the value of the equity awards they would receive in connection with their employment, and fluctuations in our stock price may make it more difficult to attract, retain, and motivate employees. In addition, we do not have long-term employment agreements with any of our key personnel and do not maintain any “key person” life insurance policies. The loss of the services of any of our senior management or other key personnel, or our inability to attract highly qualified senior management and other key personnel, could harm our business. Risks Related to the Separation and Our Operation as an Independent Publicly Traded Company We may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the separation. We may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the separation of PayPal from eBay Inc., which we refer to as the separation, or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all. The separation and distribution were expected to provide the following benefits, among others: enhanced strategic and management focus; better ability to form strategic relationships; faster decision-making; more efficient allocation of capital; alignment of incentives with performance objectives; direct access to the capital markets; and a distinct investment identity. If we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits expected to result from the separation, or if such benefits are delayed, our business could be harmed. If the distribution, together with certain related transactions, does not qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), eBay,PayPal and eBay stockholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities and, in certain circumstances, we could be required to indemnify eBay for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement. eBay received an opinion from its outside legal counsel regarding the qualification of the distribution, together with certain related transactions, as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code. The opinion was based on and relied on, among other things, certain facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements and undertakings of eBay and PayPal, including those relating to the past and future conduct of eBay and PayPal. If any of these representations, statements or undertakings are, or become, inaccurate or incomplete, or if eBay or PayPal breach any of their respective covenants in the separation documents, the opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized.Notwithstanding the opinion of counsel, the IRS could determine that the distribution, together with certain related transactions, should be treated as a taxable transaction if the IRS determines that any of these representations, assumptions, or undertakings upon which such opinion was based are incorrect or have been violated or if the IRS disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel. An opinion of counsel is not binding on the IRS or any court and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge the conclusions reached in the opinion. The IRS did not provide any opinion in advance of the separation that our proposed transaction will be tax-free.If the distribution, together with certain related transactions, failed to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code, in general, eBay would recognize taxable gain as if it had sold the PayPal common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value, eBay stockholders who received PayPal common stock in the distribution may be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares and we could incur significant liabilities. 28 Table of Contents We may not be able to engage in desirable strategic or capital-raising transactions following the separation. In addition, we could be liable for adverse tax consequences resulting from engaging in significant strategic or capital-raising transactions. To preserve the tax-free treatment to eBay of the separation and the distribution, under the tax matters agreement that we entered into with eBay, for a period of time following the distribution, we are generally prohibited from taking certain actions that prevent the distribution and related transactions from qualifying as a transaction that is generally tax-free, for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code. These restrictions may limit our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or other transactions that we or our stockholders might consider desirable or may present us from engaging in certain capital-raising transactions. We have no history of operating as an independent, publicly traded company in our current form, and our historical financial information is not necessarily representative of the results that we would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results. The combined and consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K were derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of eBay and do not necessarily reflect the financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows that we would have achieved as a separate, independent, publicly traded company during the periods presented or those that we will achieve in the future, primarily as a result of the factors described below:•Prior to the separation, our business was operated by eBay as part of its broader corporate organization, rather than as an independent company. eBay or its affiliates performed various corporate functions for us, such as legal, finance, treasury, accounting, tax, auditing, human resources, certain compliance functions, and public affairs. Our historical financial results reflect allocations of corporate expenses from eBay for such functions, which are likely to be less than the comparable expenses we would have incurred had we operated as a separate publicly traded company. In addition, we may need to significantly increase our investment in certain of these functions to maintain appropriate levels of administrative, legal and regulatory compliance. •Prior to the separation, our business was integrated with the other businesses of eBay. Historically, we shared economies of scope and scale in costs, employees, vendor relationships and customer relationships. Although we have entered into arm’s length agreements with eBay, including the operating agreement, these arrangements may not retain or fully capture the benefits that we enjoyed as a result of being integrated with eBay and may result in our paying higher charges than in the past for these services. This could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.•As a part of eBay, we benefited from, among other things, the acquisition of new customers from eBay, capital to fund acquisitions, investments and credit, and data from eBay that helps us to manage risks and maintain a low loss rate. In addition, being a part of eBay enabled us to leverage eBay’s technology capabilities, data, commerce platforms and relationships with retailers, brands and large merchants worldwide. The loss of these synergies and benefits could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.•Generally, our working capital requirements and capital for our general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and capital expenditures, were historically satisfied as part of the corporate-wide cash management policies of eBay. We may need to obtain additional financing from banks, through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities, or through strategic relationships or other arrangements, which may or may not be available and may be more costly.•The cost of capital for our business may be higher than eBay’s cost of capital prior to the separation.Other significant changes may occur in our cost structure, management, financing, and business operations as a result of operating as an independent company separate from eBay.

After the distribution, we continue to derive a significant amount of revenues and operating income from eBay. If the operating agreement expires or is terminated prior to its expiration, or if there is a significant change in our relationship with eBay, including if eBay becomes a merchant of record, eliminates or modifies any of its risk management or customer protection programs, directs transactions to a different provider of payment services or offers eBay customers more payment options, our business could be materially harmed. eBay may fail to perform under various agreements that were executed as part of the separation or we may fail to have necessary systems and services in place when certain of the transaction agreements expire. In connection with the separation, we entered into a separation and distribution agreement with eBay as well as various other agreements, including an operating agreement, colocation services agreements, transition services agreements, a tax matters agreement, an employee matters agreement, an intellectual property matters agreement, a data sharing addendum, and a product development agreement. The separation agreement, the tax matters agreement, the employee matters agreement, and the intellectual property matters agreement determine the allocation of assets and liabilities (including by means of licensing) between the companies following the separation for those respective areas and include any necessary indemnifications related to liabilities and obligations. The operating agreement, the colocation services agreements and the data sharing addendum establish certain commercial relationships between eBay and us related to payment processing, credit, information technology infrastructure and data sharing. The transition services agreements provide for the performance of certain services by each company for the benefit of the other for a limited period of time after the separation. If we or eBay is unable to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements, including its respective indemnification obligations, we could incur operational difficulties or losses or be required to make substantial indemnification or other payments to eBay. If we do not have in place our own systems and services, or if we do not have agreements with other providers of these services once these transaction agreements expire or terminate, we may not be able to operate our business effectively and our financial condition and result of operations may be adversely affected. After the separation, certain of our directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their previous or continuing positions at eBay. Because of their current or former positions with eBay, certain of our directors own eBay common stock and equity awards. Following the separation, even though our board of directors consists of a majority of directors who are independent, some of our directors continue to have a financial interest in eBay common stock and equity awards. In addition, one of our directors continues to serve on the eBay board of directors. Continuing ownership of eBay common stock and equity awards or service as a director at both companies could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest if PayPal and eBay were to have disagreements about the agreements between them or face decisions that could have different implications for PayPal and eBay. Risks Related to Our Common Stock The price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly. The price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:•actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;•changes in earnings estimated by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;•the change in our stockholder base following the distribution;•the operating and stock price performance of comparable companies;•changes to the regulatory and legal environment under which we operate; and•market conditions in the payments industry, the industries of merchants and the domestic and worldwide economy as a whole. 30 Table of Contents PayPal’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the state courts of the State of Delaware, or, if no state court located in the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the District of Delaware, as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by PayPal’s stockholders, which could discourage lawsuits against PayPal and PayPal’s directors and officers. PayPal’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that unless the corporation otherwise determines, the state courts of the State of Delaware, or, if no state court located in the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the District of Delaware, will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of PayPal, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director or officer of PayPal to PayPal or PayPal’s stockholders, creditors or other constituents, any action asserting a claim against PayPal or any director or officer of PayPal arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (\"DGCL\") or PayPal’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against PayPal or any director or officer of PayPal governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of PayPal’s stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes with PayPal or PayPal’s directors or officers, which may discourage such lawsuits against PayPal and PayPal’s directors and officers. Alternatively, if a court outside of Delaware were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above, PayPal could incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect PayPal’s business, financial condition or results of operations. Certain provisions in PayPal’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may prevent or delay an acquisition of PayPal, which could decrease the trading price of PayPal common stock. PayPal’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain certain provisions that may have the effect of deterring coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and by encouraging prospective acquirers to negotiate with PayPal’s board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others:•rules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings;•the fact that directors may not be elected, removed or replaced at stockholder-requested special meetings unless a person, entity or group owns at least a majority of PayPal’s outstanding common stock;•the right of PayPal’s board to issue preferred stock and to determine the voting, dividend and other rights of preferred stock without stockholder approval; and•the ability of PayPal’s directors, and not stockholders, to fill vacancies on PayPal’s board of directors in most circumstances.PayPal has also elected not to be governed by Section 203 of the DGCL, which provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that acquire, or are affiliated with a person that acquires, more than 15% of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the date on which that person or its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15% of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock. PayPal’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, however, contains a provision that generally mirrors Section 203 of the DGCL, except that it provides for a 20% threshold instead of the 15% provided for by the DGCL. These provisions could delay or prevent a change of control that PayPal’s stockholders may favor.Certain of the above provisions were added pursuant to the agreement between eBay Inc. and certain entities under the control of Carl C. Icahn. These provisions are not intended to make PayPal immune from takeovers. However, these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and may delay or prevent an acquisition that PayPal’s board of directors determines is not in the best interests of PayPal and PayPal’s stockholders. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors.In addition, an acquisition or further issuance of PayPal’s stock (including preferred stock) could trigger the application of Section 355(e) of the Code. For a discussion of Section 355(e), see “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” in our registration statement on Form 10, as amended, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Under the tax matters agreement, in such circumstances, PayPal would be required to indemnify eBay for any resulting taxes, which could materially and adversely affect us. Moreover, this indemnity obligation might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control that PayPal’s stockholders may consider favorable. Please refer to “Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions” and “Description of PayPal’s Capital Stock” in our registration statement on Form 10, as amended, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a more detailed description of these agreements and provisions. 31 Table of Contents We own and lease various properties in the U.S. and other countries around the world.

The Separation from eBay On September 30, 2014, eBay Inc. (“eBay”) announced its intent to separate its payments business into an independent, publicly-traded company. To accomplish this separation, in January 2015, eBay incorporated PayPal Holdings, Inc. (“PayPal Holdings”) which is now the parent of PayPal, Inc. and holds directly or indirectly all of the assets and liabilities associated with PayPal, Inc. In June 2015, the board of directors of eBay approved the separation (the \"separation\") of eBay's payments business through the distribution (the \"distribution\") of 100% of the outstanding common stock of PayPal to eBay's stockholders. PayPal Holdings' registration statement on Form 10, as amended, was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on June 29, 2015. On July 17, 2015 (the \"distribution date\"), PayPal Holdings became an independent publicly-traded company through the pro rata distribution by eBay of 100% of the outstanding common stock of PayPal Holdings to eBay stockholders. Each eBay stockholder of record as of the close of business on July 8, 2015 received one share of PayPal Holdings common stock for every share of eBay common stock held on the record date. Approximately 1.2 billion shares of PayPal Holdings common stock were distributed on July 17, 2015 to eBay stockholders. PayPal Holdings' common stock began \"regular way\" trading under the ticker symbol \"PYPL\" on The NASDAQ Stock Market on July 20, 2015.Prior to the separation, eBay transferred substantially all of the assets and liabilities and operations of eBay's payments business to PayPal Holdings, which was completed in June 2015 (the \"capitalization\"). The combined financial statements prior to the capitalization were prepared on a stand-alone basis and were derived from eBay's consolidated financial statements and accounting records. The combined financial statements reflect our financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income and cash flows as our business was operated as part of eBay prior to the capitalization. Following the capitalization, our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PayPal Holdings and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The combined and consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of dates and for periods prior to the separation may not be indicative of what our financial position, results of operations and cash flows would have been as a separate stand-alone entity during the periods presented, nor are they indicative of what our financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be in the future. For additional information, see \"Note 1—Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to our combined and consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires, references to “we,” “our,” “us,” “the Company” and “PayPal” refer to PayPal Holdings and its consolidated subsidiaries or, in the case of information as of dates or for periods prior to the separation, the combined and consolidated entities of the payments business of eBay, including PayPal, Inc. and certain other assets and liabilities that had been historically held at the eBay corporate level but were specifically identifiable and attributable to the payments business. 35 Table of Contents Overview Net revenues increased $1.2 billion, or 15% in 2015 and $1.3 billion, or 19% in 2014. The increase was primarily driven by growth in total payment volume (“TPV”) of 20% in 2015 and 26% in 2014. Operating expenses increased $1 billion and $1.1 billion, or 15% and 20%, in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in 2015 was primarily due to an increase in transaction expense, customer support and operations expense, and transaction and loan losses. The increase in 2014 was primarily due to an increase in transaction expense, higher expenses due to additional sales and marketing programs and product development initiatives, and an increase in transaction and loan losses.Operating income increased $193 million, or 15%, in 2015 compared to 2014, and $177 million, or 16%, in 2014 compared to 2013. Non-GAAP operating income increased $327 million, or 20%, in 2015 compared to 2014 and $237 million, or 17%, in 2014 compared to 2013. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 21% in 2015, 2014 and 2013. Operating income and non-GAAP operating income increased in 2015 and 2014 primarily as a result of higher net revenues partially offset by increased operating expenses.We recorded net income of $1.2 billion in 2015, $419 million in 2014 and $955 million in 2013. The increase in net income in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily attributable to an increase in operating income of $193 million and a decrease in income tax expense of $582 million primarily resulting from the recognition of deferred tax liabilities in 2014 relating to undistributed foreign earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries for 2013 and prior years. The decrease in net income in 2014 compared to 2013 also was primarily attributable to the recognition of deferred tax liabilities in 2014 relating to undistributed foreign earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries for 2013 and prior years which resulted in an increase in income tax expense in 2014. We recorded non-GAAP net income of $1.6 billion in 2015, $1.3 billion in 2014 and $1.2 billion in 2013. The increase in non-GAAP net income in 2015 and 2014 was primarily attributable to an increase in operating income in each of these periods. Our diluted net income per share was $1.00 in 2015, $0.34 in 2014 and $0.78 in 2013. Our non-GAAP diluted net income per share was $1.29 in 2015, $1.10 in 2014 and $0.97 in 2013.We generated net cash flows from operations of $2.5 billion in 2015, compared to $2.2 billion and $2.0 billion in 2014 and 2013, respectively. We generated free cash flow of $1.8 billion, $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.The following table provides a summary of our combined and consolidated operating results for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013: Year Ended December 31, Percent Increase/(Decrease) 2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 (In millions, except percentages)Net Revenues$9,248 $8,025 $6,727 15 % 19 %Operating Expenses7,787 6,757 5,636 15 % 20 %Operating Income1,461 1,268 1,091 15 % 16 %Income Tax Expense260 842 129 (69)% 553 %Effective income tax rate17% 67% 12% ** ** Net Income$1,228 $419 $955 193 % (56)%Net income per diluted share(1)(2)$1.00 $0.34 $0.78 192 % (56)% 1 On July 17, 2015, the distribution date, eBay stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 8, 2015 received one share of PayPal common stock for every share of eBay common stock held as of the record date.

Business Environment We are a leading technology platform company that enables digital and mobile payments on behalf of consumers and merchants worldwide. We believe in providing simple, affordable, secure and reliable financial services and digital payments to help our customers around the world to achieve their financial goals. We strive to increase our relevance for consumers, merchants, friends and family to access and move their money anywhere in the world, anytime, on any platform and through any device (e.g., mobile, tablets, personal computers or wearables). We provide safer and simpler ways for businesses of all sizes to accept payments from merchant websites, mobile devices and applications, and at offline retail locations through a wide range of payment solutions. We also facilitate person to person payments through PayPal, Venmo and Xoom (acquired in November 2015). Our combined payment solution capabilities, including our PayPal, PayPal Credit, Braintree, Venmo, and Xoom products, comprise our proprietary Payments Platform.We provide merchants and consumers with protection programs on substantially all transactions completed through our Payments Platform, except for transactions using our gateway and Paydiant products. Our gateway products include our Payflow Payments and certain Braintree products. A payment gateway links a merchant's website to their processing network and merchant account. These programs protect both merchants and consumers from loss primarily due to fraud and counterparty non-performance. Our risk management capabilities allow us to provide these protections, which are generally much broader than those protections provided by other participants in the payments industry. Most payments providers do not offer merchant protection in general, and those that do so generally do not provide protection of online or card not present transactions. As a result, merchants may incur losses for chargebacks and other claims on certain transactions when using other payments providers that they would not incur if they had used PayPal’s payments services. PayPal also provides consumer protection against losses on qualifying purchases and accepts claims for 180 days post transaction in the markets that PayPal serves. This protection is generally consistent with, or better than, that offered by other payments providers. We believe that as a result of these programs, consumers can be confident that they will only be required to pay if they receive the product in the condition as described, and merchants can be confident that they will receive payment for the product that they are delivering to the customer.Our Payments Platform and open application programming interfaces (“APIs”) are designed to allow developers to innovate with ease and to offer cutting edge applications to a large ecosystem of merchants and consumers, while at the same time maintaining the security of our customers’ financial information. We provide developers with easy to use, flexible and powerful tools that are designed to leverage our global reach and payment capabilities. Our software developer kits (“SDKs”) are specifically focused on the mobile application market and are designed to remove friction by not requiring a redirect to PayPal.com or an additional login. We are using a true “mobile first” approach to make payments simple and intuitive.Information security risks for global payments and technology companies have significantly increased in recent years. Although we have not experienced any material impacts relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches on our Payments Platform, there can be no assurance that we are immune to these risks and will not suffer such losses in the future. See “Risk Factors-Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition-Our business is subject to online security risks, including security and privacy breaches.”We operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened regulatory focus on all aspects of the payments industry. That focus continues to become even more heightened as regulators on a global basis focus on such important issues as countering terrorist financing, anti-money laundering, privacy and consumer protection. Some of the laws and regulations to which we are subject were enacted recently and the laws and regulations applicable to us, including those enacted prior to the advent of digital and mobile payments, are continuing to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation. Non-compliance with laws and regulations, increased penalties and enforcement actions related to non-compliance, changes in laws and regulations or their interpretation, and the enactment of new laws and regulations applicable to us could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Therefore, we monitor these areas closely to ensure compliant solutions for our customers who depend on us. 37 Table of Contents Impact of Foreign Currency Rates We have significant operations internationally that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar, subjecting us to foreign currency risk which may adversely impact our financial results. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar versus the British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar, as well as other currencies in which we conduct our international operations, impacts the translation of our net revenues and expenses generated in these foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar. We generated approximately 50% of our 2015 net revenues, 52% of our 2014 net revenues and 52% of our 2013 net revenues from merchants or consumers domiciled outside of the United States. Other than the United States, the United Kingdom was the only country where we generated more than 10% of total net revenues in 2015, 2014 and 2013. During each of these periods, we have also generated more than 10% of total net revenues in the Euro zone. Because we have generated substantial net revenues internationally in recent periods, including 2015, 2014 and 2013, we are subject to the risks of doing business in foreign countries as discussed under “Risk Factors—Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition.” We calculate the year-over-year impact of foreign currency movements on our business using prior period foreign currency exchange rates applied to current year transactional currency amounts. While changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported results, we have a foreign exchange exposure management program whereby we designate certain foreign currency exchange contracts as cash flow hedges to help minimize the impact on earnings from foreign currency rate movements. Gains and losses from these foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized as a component of transaction revenues in the same period the forecasted transactions impact earnings. In 2015, foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net revenues by approximately $345 million (inclusive of a $182 million favorable impact from hedging activities) and favorably impacted operating expenses by approximately $310 million. In 2014, foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net revenues by approximately $58 million (inclusive of a $36 million negative impact from hedging activities) and favorably impacted operating expenses by approximately $55 million. While we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to minimize the impact on earnings from foreign currency rate movements, it is impossible to predict or eliminate the effects of this exposure.Additionally, in connection with our services in multiple currencies, we set our foreign exchange rates twice per day, and may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the times that we set our foreign exchange rates. Given that we also have foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries, we have an additional foreign exchange exposure management program whereby we use foreign exchange contracts to offset the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency gains and losses on our assets and liabilities are recorded in “Other income (expense), net,” which are offset by the gains and losses on the foreign exchange contracts. These foreign exchange contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. 38 Table of Contents Financial Results Net revenues Revenue description We earn revenue primarily by processing customer transactions on our Payments Platform and from other value added services. Our revenues are classified into the following two categories:•Transaction revenues: Net transaction fees charged to consumers and merchants based on the volume of activity processed through our Payments Platform, including our PayPal, PayPal Credit, Venmo, Braintree and Xoom products.•Other value added services: Net revenues derived principally from interest and fees earned on our PayPal Credit loans receivable portfolio, subscription fees, gateway fees, gain on sale of participation interests in certain consumer loans receivable, revenue share we earn through partnerships, interest earned on certain PayPal customer account balances, fees earned through our Paydiant products and other services that we provide to consumers and merchants.Transaction revenues are generated from fees charged to consumers and merchants on the volume of activity we enable (“Total Payments Volume” or “TPV”). We define TPV as the value of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed through our Payments Platform, excluding transactions processed through our gateway and Paydiant products. Growth in TPV is also directly impacted by the payment transactions that we enable on our Payments Platform. Payment transactions are the total number of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed through our Payments Platform, excluding transactions processed through our gateway and Paydiant products. We earn additional fees on transactions settled in foreign currencies when we enable cross-border transactions (i.e., transactions where the merchant or consumer were in different countries).Our revenues can be significantly impacted by the following:•The mix of merchants, products and services;•Mix between domestic and cross-border transactions;•Geographic region or country in which a transaction occurs; and•The amount of PayPal Credit loans receivable outstanding with consumers and merchants. Net revenues analysis The significant components of our net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were as follows: Year Ended December 31, Percent Increase/(Decrease) 2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 (In millions, except percentages)Transaction revenues$8,128 $7,107 $5,992 14% 19%Other value added services1,120 918 735 22% 25%Net revenues$9,248 $8,025 $6,727 15% 19% Net revenues from transaction revenues increased by $1.0 billion, or 14%, in 2015 compared to 2014. Net revenues from transaction revenues increased by $1.1 billion, or 19%, in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase in transaction revenues in 2015 and 2014 was due primarily to the growth in TPV and the growth in total number of payment transactions on our Payments Platform. Acquisitions were not material to total transaction revenue growth in 2015 or 2014. The impact of increases or decreases in prices charged to our customers did not significantly impact revenue growth in 2015 or 2014.The following table provides a summary of our active customer accounts, number of payment transactions, TPV and related metrics: 39 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, Percent Increase/(Decrease) 2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 (In millions, except percentages*)Active customer accounts(1)179 162 143 11% 13%Number of payment transactions(2)4,928 3,964 3,261 24% 22%Payment transactions per active account(3)27.5 24.5 22.9 12% 7%Total TPV(4)$281,764 $234,635 $185,606 20% 26%Percent of cross-border TPV22% 24% 24% ** ** 1 An active customer account is a registered account that successfully sent or received at least one payment or payment reversal through our Payments Platform, excluding transactions processed through our gateway and Paydiant products, in the past 12 months.2 Payment transactions are the total number of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed through our Payments Platform, excluding transactions processed through our gateway and Paydiant products.3 Number of payment transactions per active customer account reflects the total number of payment transactions within the previous 12 month period, divided by active customer accounts at the end of the period4 Total Payment Volume or “TPV” is the value of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed through our Payments Platform, excluding transactions processed through our gateway and Paydiant products. * All amounts in tables are rounded to the nearest millions, except as otherwise noted. As a result, certain amounts may not recalculate using the rounded amounts provided.** Not MeaningfulThe growth in TPV of 20% in 2015 and 26% in 2014 was driven by growth in active accounts, a higher number of payment transactions driven by the increase in engagement from our customers and growth from our Braintree and Venmo products. TPV growth in 2015 was negatively impacted by foreign currency fluctuations due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. The growth in transaction revenues was lower than the growth in TPV and growth in payment transactions in 2015 and 2014 due to a higher portion of TPV generated by large merchants who generally pay lower rates on higher transaction volume and a lower mix of cross-border transactions. The percent of TPV generated by large merchants increased four percentage points in 2015 and three percentage points in 2014. Cross-border transactions generally provide higher revenues than similar transactions that take place within a single country or market. Net revenues from other value added services increased by $202 million, or 22% in 2015 compared to 2014. Net revenues from other value added services increased by $183 million or 25% in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase in net revenues from other value added services in 2015 was due primarily to interest and fee income earned on loans receivable outstanding from consumers and merchants that used our PayPal Credit products, revenue share earned under our credit program agreement with Synchrony Financial (formerly GE Capital Retail Bank), and the gain on sale of a participation interest in certain consumer loans receivable that we purchased, as described further below. The increase in net revenues from other value added services in 2014 was due primarily to interest and fee income earned on loans receivable outstanding from consumers and merchants that used our PayPal Credit products. In the third quarter of 2015, we amended the terms of our credit program agreement with Synchrony Financial. As a result of the amendment, we recognized $78 million of additional revenue under the agreement during 2015. In addition, as part of the amended agreement, our obligation to purchase the portfolio of consumer loan receivables relating to the customer accounts arising out of the credit program agreement with Synchrony Financial was terminated. We retain an option to purchase the portfolio at the end of the new contract term. In the second quarter of 2015, we completed an arrangement with certain investors under which we sold participation interests in certain consumer loans and interest receivable related to our PayPal Credit products with a gross book value of approximately $708 million. As a result of the arrangement, the impact to net revenues from other value added services during 2015 was a net decrease of $35 million compared to 2014 due to the reduction in net revenues earned from interest and fees on the participation interests sold, partially offset by the gain recognized on the sale of the participation interest (inclusive of the gain of $26 million recognized on the initial sale of approximately $708 million in certain consumer loans receivable) and servicing fees. 40 Table of Contents Operating Expenses The following table summarizes our operating expenses and related metrics we use to assess the trend in each: Year Ended December 31, Percent Increase/(Decrease) 2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 (In millions, except percentages)Transaction expense$2,610 $2,170 $1,835 20 % 18%Transaction and loan losses809 646 502 25 % 29%Customer support and operations1,220 1,055 950 16 % 11%Sales and marketing985 998 791 (1)% 26%Product development947 890 727 6 % 22%General and administrative560 482 378 16 % 28%Depreciation and amortization608 516 453 18 % 14%Restructuring48 — — ** ** Total operating expenses$7,787 $6,757 $5,636 15 % 20%Transaction expense rate10.93% 0.92% 0.99% Transaction and loan loss rate20.29% 0.28% 0.27% 1 Transaction expense rate is calculated by dividing transaction expense by TPV 2 Transaction and loan loss rate is calculated by dividing transaction and loan losses by TPV**Not Meaningful Transaction expense Transaction expense is primarily comprised of the costs we incur to accept a customer’s funding source of payment. These costs include fees paid to payment processors and other financial institutions in order to draw funds from a customer’s credit or debit card, bank account or other funding source they have stored in their digital wallet. Transaction expense also includes fees paid to disbursement partners for processing and disbursement costs to enable a transaction and interest expense on borrowings incurred to finance our portfolio of loans receivable arising from our PayPal Credit funding option. We refer to the allocation of funding sources used by our consumers as our “funding mix.” The cost of funding a transaction with a credit or debit card is generally more costly than the cost of funding a transaction from a bank or through internal sources such as a PayPal account balance or PayPal Credit. As we expand the availability of alternative funding sources to our customers, a change in funding mix can increase or decrease our transaction expense rate. The cost of funding a transaction is also impacted by the geographic region or country in which a transaction occurs because we generally pay lower rates for transactions funded with credit cards outside the U.S. than in the U.S. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, approximately 45%, 48%, and 48% of TPV, respectively, was generated outside of the U.S. Transaction expense increased $440 million, or 20%, in 2015 compared to 2014. The increases in transaction expense in 2015 was primarily attributable to an increase in TPV, offset by favorable foreign currency fluctuations due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Transaction expense increased by $335 million, or 18%, in 2014 compared to 2013, due primarily to an increase in TPV. The impact from acquisitions was not material to our total transaction expense growth in 2015 or 2014.Our transaction expense rate in 2015 increased compared to 2014 due to higher assessments charged by payments processors and other financial institutions when we draw funds from a customer’s credit or debit card, bank account or other funding sources partially offset by cost efficiencies from our Payments Platform and a favorable funding mix. Our transaction expense rates in 2014 decreased compared to 2013 due to cost efficiencies from our Payments Platform, a favorable funding mix and a larger share of TPV in countries where we pay lower rates for transactions funded with credit cards than in the U.S. Interest expense on borrowings incurred to finance our portfolio of loans receivable, included in transaction expense, was $3 million, $7 million and $14 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Transaction and loan losses Transaction losses include the expense associated with our customer protection programs, fraud, and chargebacks. Loan losses include the losses associated with our loans receivable balances. We expect our transaction and loan losses to fluctuate depending on many factors, including TPV, macroeconomic conditions, the extent of our customer protection programs, the impact of regulatory changes, and the credit quality of loans receivable arising from transactions funded with our PayPal Credit products and working capital advances to selected merchant sellers. Additionally, prior to the distribution we recovered certain amounts from eBay related to customer protection programs offered on eligible eBay purchases made with PayPal. These costs include the actual amount of protection losses associated with eBay's customer protection programs that we administer and fund on behalf of eBay, which are included as a reduction of transaction and loan losses. Recoveries associated with protection losses incurred on eligible eBay purchases during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $27 million, $43 million and $48 million, respectively. Following the distribution, we no longer administer eBay's customer protection programs or recover amounts from eBay associated with protection losses incurred on eligible eBay purchases; instead, we and eBay each independently administer our own customer protection programs. Further, our customer protection programs extend to customers’ eligible purchases on eBay and therefore we have incurred and expect to continue to incur related incremental costs associated with our customer protection programs following the distribution.Transaction and loan losses increased $163 million or 25% in 2015 compared to 2014, and increased $144 million or 29% in 2014 compared to 2013. Transaction losses were $511 million in 2015, $408 million in 2014 and $310 million in 2013, reflecting an increase of 25% in 2015 compared to 2014, and an increase of 32% in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase in each of these periods was predominately attributable to higher TPV. Our transaction loss rate in 2015 increased compared to 2014 due to lower recoveries in 2015 associated with transaction losses incurred on eligible eBay purchases offset by improved consumer loss performance and a higher provision in the prior year from actual losses incurred. Our transaction loss rate in 2014 increased compared to 2013 due to a higher provision in 2014 from actual losses incurred.Loan losses relating to our loans receivable portfolio were $298 million in 2015, $238 million in 2014 and $192 million in 2013, reflecting an increase of 25% in 2015 compared to 2014, and an increase of 23% in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase in loan losses in both 2015 and 2014 was due primarily to growth in the portfolio of loans receivable outstanding arising from consumers who chose PayPal Credit as a funding option and an increase in working capital advances to selected merchant sellers. The total consumer loans receivable balance as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $4.0 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively, reflecting a year over year increase of 8% in 2015, including the sale of additional participation interests to certain investors in the second quarter of 2015. The following table provides information regarding the credit quality of our pool of U.S. consumer loans and interest receivable balance: 41 Table of Contents December 31, 2015 2014Percentage of Loans Receivable with FICO scores > 68054% 54%Percentage of Loans Receivable with FICO scores < 5999% 9%Percent of Loans Receivable current90% 90%Percent of Loans Receivable > 90 days outstanding4% 4% We offer credit products to certain existing small and medium-sized merchants through our PayPal Working Capital product. The total PayPal Working Capital advances and fees receivable (\"Merchant Receivables\") outstanding as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $421 million and $103 million, respectively, reflecting a year over year increase of 309%. To assess a merchant seeking a PayPal Working Capital advance, we use, among other indicators, a risk model that we have internally developed that we refer to as our PayPal Working Capital Risk Model (“PRM”), as a credit quality indicator to help predict the merchant's ability to repay the principal balance and fixed fee related to the working capital advance. The PRM uses multiple variables as predictors of the merchant's ability to repay a working capital advance. Drivers of the model include the merchant's annual payment volume and payment processing history with PayPal, prior repayment history with the PayPal Working Capital product, and other measures. Merchants are assigned a PRM credit score within the range of 350 to 750. We generally expect that merchants to which we extend a working capital advance will have PRM scores greater than 525. We generally consider scores above 610 to be very good and to pose limited credit risk. We assess a participating merchant’s PRM score on a recurring basis. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the weighted average PRM score related to our PayPal Working Capital balances outstanding was 630 and 622, respectively.The determination of delinquency for merchant receivables is based on the current expected repayment period of the advance and fixed fee as compared to the original expected repayment period. We calculate the repayment rate based on the merchant's expected future payment volume such that repayment of the advance and fixed fee is typically expected to occur within 9 to 12 months from the date of the advance. On a monthly basis, we recalculate the repayment period based on the actual repayment activity on the receivable. As such, actual repayment periods are dependent on actual payment processing volumes. The following table provides information regarding the credit quality of our merchant receivables: 42 Table of Contents December 31, 2015 2014Percentage of Merchant Receivable with PRM scores > 61061% 56%Percentage of Merchant Receivable with PRM scores < 56517% 21%Percent of Merchant Receivable within original expected repayment period77% 77%Percent of Merchant Receivable > 90 days outstanding6% 9% Modifications to the acceptable risk parameters of our PayPal Credit products for the periods presented did not have a material impact on our loan losses. Customer support and operations Customer support and operations expenses include costs incurred to provide 24-hour call support to our customers, our site operations and other infrastructure costs incurred to support our Payments Platform, costs to support our trust and security programs protecting our merchants and consumers and other costs incurred in our operations centers. Customer support and operations costs increased $165 million, or 16%, in 2015 compared to 2014 and $105 million, or 11%, in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase in 2015 and 2014 was predominantly related to an increase in headcount to service the growth in our active customer accounts and the number of payment transactions occurring on our Payments Platform and an increase in expenses incurred in 2015 to operate as an independent public company. This increase was offset in part by favorable foreign currency fluctuations due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Sales and marketing Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of customer acquisition, business development, advertising, marketing programs, and employee compensation and contractor costs to support these programs. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $13 million, or 1%, in 2015 compared to 2014. Sales and marketing expense increased by $207 million, or 26%, in 2014 compared to 2013. The decrease in 2015 was due to a decrease in employee and contractor related expenses and favorable foreign currency fluctuations due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, offset in part by higher marketing spend. The increase in sales and marketing expenses in 2014 was due primarily to higher spend to support our strategic initiatives. In 2014, we redesigned our PayPal logo and carried out significant campaigns designed to enhance our global brand recognition and drive consumer engagement. Product development Product development expenses consist primarily of employee compensation and contractor costs that are incurred in connection with the development of our Payments Platform, new products and the improvement of our existing products. Product development expenses exclude software and website development costs that are capitalized. The amortization of developed technology is included in depreciation and amortization expense.Product development expenses increased $57 million, or 6%, in 2015 compared to 2014 and $163 million, or 22%, in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase in 2015 was due primarily to investments in our Payments Platform, creating new mobile experiences for our customers and supporting our strategic initiatives, partially offset by a decrease in employee and contractor related expenses. The increase in 2014 was due primarily to investments in our Payments Platform, creating new mobile experiences for our customers and supporting our strategic initiatives. The acquisition of Braintree also impacted the growth in product development expenses in 2014 compared to 2013. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs incurred to provide support to our business, including legal, human resources, finance, executive and other support operations. Our legal expenses, including those related to ongoing legal proceedings, case settlements and judgments, and regulatory proceedings and fines, may fluctuate substantially from period to period.For periods prior to the separation, our combined and consolidated financial statements include expenses associated with workplace resources and information technology that were previously allocated to the Payments segment of eBay, and additional expenses related to certain corporate functions, including senior management, legal, human resources and finance. These expenses also include allocations related to stock based compensation. The expenses that were incurred by eBay have been allocated to us based on direct usage or benefit where identifiable, with the remainder allocated on a pro rata basis of revenue, headcount, or other systematic measure. The corporate costs and allocation of expenses from eBay may not be indicative of the expenses that may have been incurred had we been a separate stand-alone entity during the periods presented, nor are the results stated herein indicative of the expenses we may incur in the future. Such expenses could be higher or lower. In the periods presented, a significant portion of expenses associated with these functions and allocated to us in our combined and consolidated financial statements are included in general and administrative expenses.General and administrative expenses increased $78 million, or 16%, in 2015 compared to 2014 and $104 million, or 28%, in 2014 compared to 2013. In 2015, increase in general and administrative expenses related primarily to an increase in expenses incurred to operate as an independent public company and an increase in expenses associated with professional services, including contractor related expenses, and regulatory matters. In 2015, $121 million of corporate costs and expenses allocated to us by eBay were included in general and administrative expenses representing a decrease of $86 million, or 42% compared to 2014. In 2014, $207 million of corporate costs and expenses allocated to us by eBay were included in general and administrative expenses representing an increase of $24 million, or 13%, compared to 2013. In 2014, the remaining increase in general and administrative expenses related primarily to higher employee-related costs, including those related to the separation, and other costs incurred to operate as an independent public company. 43 Table of Contents Depreciation and Amortization The primary components of our depreciation and amortization expenses include the depreciation and amortization of software, including our technology platform, equipment used to deliver our services and the amortization of acquired intangible assets. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $92 million, or 18%, in 2015 compared to 2014 and $63 million, or 14%, in 2014 compared to 2013. The increases in 2015 and 2014 were predominantly due to additional depreciation expenses associated with investments in our technology platforms and an increase in capital expenditures to operate as an independent public company. Amortization expense for intangible assets was $93 million, $84 million and $70 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 respectively. The increase in amortization of intangibles in 2015 and 2014 was due primarily to our acquisitions. Restructuring In January 2015, at a regular meeting of eBay’s board of directors (the “eBay Board”), the eBay Board approved a plan to implement a strategic reduction of its existing global workforce. The reduction was completed by the end of 2015 primarily impacting sales and marketing and product development expenses. Restructuring expenses were $48 million in 2015. No restructuring expenses were recognized in 2014 or 2013. Income Tax Expense Our effective tax rate was 17% in 2015, 67% in 2014, and 12% in 2013. The decrease in our effective tax rate during 2015 compared to 2014 and increase in our effective tax rate during 2014 compared to 2013 was due primarily to the recognition in 2014 of a U.S. deferred tax liability of approximately $650 million on $1.9 billion of undistributed foreign earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries for 2013 and prior years. See “Note 14—Income Taxes” to the combined and consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information on our effective tax rate. Non-GAAP Financial Information Non-GAAP financial information is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s performance that excludes or includes amounts that are different than the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation S-K, portions of this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” include a reconciliation of certain non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the Company’s related financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP.We present non-GAAP financial measures to enhance an investor’s evaluation of our ongoing operating results and to facilitate meaningful comparison of our results between periods. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to, among other things, evaluate our ongoing operations, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation.We exclude the following items from non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted share, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP effective tax rate:•Stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes. This consists of expenses for stock options, restricted stock and employee stock purchases. We exclude stock-based compensation expense from our non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses that management does not believe are reflective of ongoing operating results. The related employer payroll taxes is dependent on our stock price and the timing and size of exercises by employees of their stock options and the vesting of their restricted stock, over which management has limited to no control, and as such management does not believe it correlates to the operation of our business.•Amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets, impairment of goodwill, and transaction expenses from the acquisition or disposal of a business. We incur amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill in connection with acquisitions and may incur significant gains or losses or transactional expenses from the acquisition or disposal of a business and therefore exclude these amounts from our non-GAAP measures. We exclude these items because management does not believe they are reflective of our ongoing operating results.•Separation. These are significant expenses related to the separation of our business from eBay into a separate, independent publicly-traded company. These consist primarily of third-party consulting fees, legal fees, employee retention payments and other expenses incurred to complete the separation. We exclude these items because management does not believe they are reflective of our ongoing operating results.•Restructuring. These consist of expenses for employee severance and other exit and disposal costs. We exclude restructuring charges primarily because management does not believe they are reflective of ongoing operating results.•Other certain significant gains, losses, or charges that are not indicative of our core operating results. These are significant gains, losses, or charges during a period that are the result of isolated events or transactions which have not occurred frequently in the past and are not expected to occur regularly in the future. We exclude these amounts from our results because management does not believe they are indicative of our ongoing operating results. For the year ended December 31, 2014, this includes the recognition of a U.S. deferred tax liability of approximately $650 million.•Tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments. This amount is used to present stock-based compensation and the other amounts described above on an after-tax basis consistent with the presentation of non-GAAP net income. 44 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 (In millions)GAAP operating income$1,461 $1,268 $1,091Stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes356 309 269Amortization of acquired intangible assets85 70 55Separation15 — —Restructuring48 1 (4)Acquisition related transaction expense10 — —Total non-GAAP operating income adjustments514 380 320Non-GAAP operating income$1,975 $1,648 $1,411Non-GAAP operating margin21% 21% 21% 45 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 (In millions)GAAP income before income taxes$1,488 $1,261 $1,084GAAP provision for income taxes260 842 129GAAP net income1,228 419 955Non-GAAP adjustments to net income: Non-GAAP operating income adjustments (see table above)514 380 320Amortization of investments— 4 7Other certain significant gains, losses, or charges— 646 —Separation (other income and expense)(12) — —Tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments(142) (106) (96)Non-GAAP net income$1,588 $1,343 $1,186 GAAP net income per diluted share$1.00 $0.34 $0.78Non-GAAP net income per diluted share$1.29 $1.10 $0.97Shares used in GAAP diluted share calculation(1)(2)1,229 1,224 1,224Shares used in non-GAAP diluted share calculation(1)(2)1,229 1,224 1,224 GAAP effective tax rate17% 67 % 12%Tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments to net income3% (49)% 4%Non-GAAP effective tax rate20% 18 % 16% 1 On July 17, 2015, the distribution date, eBay stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 8, 2015 received one share of PayPal common stock for every share of eBay common stock held as of the record date. Basic and diluted net income per share for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was calculated using the number of common shares distributed on July 17, 2015.2 Basic and diluted net income per share for the year ended December 31, 2015 was calculated using the number of common shares distributed on July 17, 2015 for periods prior to distribution. In addition to the non-GAAP measures discussed above, we also use free cash flow to assess our operating performance. Free cash flow represents cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. We consider free cash flow to be a key performance measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases of property and equipment and including investments in our Payments Platform, which can then be used to, among other things, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions, and return cash to shareholders. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period. Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 (In millions)Net cash provided by operating activities$2,546 $2,220 $1,993Less: Purchases of property and equipment(722) (492) (391)Free cash flow$1,824 $1,728 $1,602 Liquidity and Capital Resources We require liquidity and access to capital to fund our global operations, including customer protection programs, our PayPal Credit products, capital expenditures, investments in our business, potential acquisitions, working capital and other cash needs. The following table summarizes the cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investment balances available as of December 31, 2015 and 2014: December 31, 2015 2014 (in millions)Cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investment securities1$5,732 $2,2301Excludes assets related to customer accounts of $12.3 billion and $10.6 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.Cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments held by our foreign subsidiaries (i.e., any entities where earnings would be subject to United States tax upon repatriation) were $4.2 billion as of December 31, 2015 and $2.0 billion at December 31, 2014, or 74% and 90% of our total cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments as of those dates, respectively. During the first quarter of 2014, eBay changed its capital allocation strategy to reflect its objective of increasing its available U.S. cash, preserving its credit rating, and providing greater liquidity to meet its other cash needs in the U.S., including potential merger and acquisition activity and funding opportunistic share repurchases on an accelerated basis. As a result of the change in eBay’s capital allocation strategy, we provided for U.S. income and applicable foreign withholding taxes on $1.9 billion of undistributed foreign earnings of certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries for 2013 and prior years. We recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately $650 million based on the estimated tax consequences of repatriating these earnings. We did not provide for U.S. federal income and foreign withholding taxes on $2.3 billion of our non-U.S. subsidiaries’ undistributed earnings as of December 31, 2015. Since we do not know the time or manner in which we may repatriate those funds, we cannot determine the impact of local taxes, withholding taxes and foreign tax credits associated with the future repatriation of such earnings and therefore cannot quantify the tax liability. In the second quarter of 2015, we received a contribution of approximately $3.8 billion of cash from eBay, as well as a related estimated deferred tax liability of $236 million associated with the foreign earnings that are not considered indefinitely reinvested. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we reassessed the measurement of the deferred tax liability based on updated valuation information and reduced the deferred tax liability balance to $172 million as of December 31, 2015. The adjustment to the deferred tax liability was recorded as a contribution from eBay and resulted in an increase to net parent investment within stockholders' equity. This cash is being used for general corporate purposes in both our international and domestic operations.In the third quarter of 2015, we entered into a credit agreement (\"Credit Agreement\") that provides for an unsecured $2.0 billion, five-year revolving credit facility that includes a $150 million letter of credit sub-facility and a $150 million swingline sub-facility, with available borrowings under the revolving credit facility reduced by the amount of any letters of credit and swingline borrowings outstanding from time to time. Borrowings and other amounts payable under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by PayPal, Inc. (the \"Guarantor\"). We may also, subject to the agreement of the applicable lenders, increase the commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to $500 million. Subject to specified conditions, we may designate one or more of our subsidiaries as additional borrowers under the Credit Agreement provided that we and the Guarantor guarantee all borrowings and other obligations of any such subsidiaries under the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2015, no subsidiaries were designated as additional borrowers. Funds borrowed under the Credit Agreement may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes .As of December 31, 2015, no borrowings or letters of credit were outstanding under the Credit Agreement. Accordingly, at December 31, 2015, $2.0 billion of borrowing capacity was available for the purposes permitted by the Credit Agreement. Loans under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at either (i) the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a margin (based on our public debt ratings) ranging from 1.00 percent to 1.625 percent or (ii) a formula based on the agent bank’s prime rate, the federal funds effective rate or LIBOR plus a margin (based on our public debt ratings) ranging from zero percent to 0.625 percent. Subject to certain conditions stated in the Credit Agreement, we and any of our subsidiaries designated as additional borrowers may borrow, prepay and reborrow amounts under the revolving credit facility at any time during the term of the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement will terminate and all amounts owing thereunder will be due and payable on July 17, 2020, unless (a) the commitments are terminated earlier, either at our request or, if an event of default occurs, by the lenders (or automatically in the case of certain bankruptcy-related events), or (b) the maturity date is extended upon our request , subject to the agreement of the lenders. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants, events of default and indemnification provisions in favor of the banks. The negative covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens, subject to certain exceptions. The financial covenants require us to meet a quarterly financial test with respect to a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio, based on our public debt ratings.We have a cash pooling arrangement with a financial institution for cash management purposes. The arrangement allows for cash withdrawals from the financial institution based upon our aggregate operating cash balances held within the financial institution (“Aggregate Cash Deposits”). The arrangement also allows us to withdraw amounts exceeding the Aggregate Cash Deposits up to an agreed-upon limit. The net balance of the withdrawals and the Aggregate Cash Deposits are used by the financial institution as a basis for calculating our net interest expense or income under these arrangements. As of December 31, 2015, we had a total of $2.0 billion in cash withdrawals offsetting our $2.0 billion in Aggregate Cash Deposits held within the financial institution under the cash pooling arrangement.As of December 31, 2015, we were rated investment grade by Standard and Poor's Financial Services, LLC and Fitch Ratings, Inc. We expect that these credit rating agencies will continue to monitor our performance now that we have separated from eBay, including our capital structure and results of operations. Our goal is to be rated investment grade, but as circumstances change there are factors that could drive the long term credit ratings both down and up. If that were to occur, it could increase our borrowing costs, including the interest rate on loans under our Credit Agreement. The risk of losses from our customer protection programs are specific to individual customers, merchants and transactions, and may also be impacted by regional variations in these programs and modifications to the program resulting from changes to regulatory requirements. For the periods presented in these combined and consolidated financial statements included in this report, payments under these customer protection programs have ranged between 0.08% and 0.12% of TPV. Historical trends may not be an indication of future results. In addition, prior to the distribution, we recovered certain amounts from eBay related to customer protection programs offered on eligible eBay purchases made with PayPal. These costs included the actual amount of protection losses associated with eBay's customer protection programs that we administered and funded on behalf of eBay, which are included as a reduction of transaction and loan losses. Following the distribution, we no longer administer eBay's customer protection programs or recover amounts from eBay associated with transaction losses incurred on eligible eBay purchases; instead, we and eBay each independently administer our own customer protection programs. Further, our customer protection programs extend to customers’ eligible purchases on eBay and therefore we have incurred and expect to continue to incur incremental costs associated with our customer protection programs following the distribution.We currently fund the purchase of the PayPal Credit consumer receivables with international and domestic cash resources. To the extent that our PayPal Credit products become more widely available, and as we further promote PayPal Credit, customer adoption and usage of such products may expand. Any resulting growth in the portfolio of loan receivables would increase our liquidity needs and any failure to meet those liquidity needs could adversely affect our business. In the second quarter of 2015, we completed an arrangement with certain investors under which we sold a participation interest in certain consumer loan and interest receivables related to our PayPal Credit products with a gross book value of approximately $708 million. The sale resulted in cash proceeds of approximately $710 million, of which $692 million related to the outstanding principal and $18 million related to the interest receivable. We will continue to evaluate partnerships and third party sources of funding of our credit portfolio, including, but not limited to, commercial banks, securitization markets, private equity firms and sovereign wealth funds and under certain specific circumstances, the use of customer funds. Our objective is to expand the availability of our credit products with capital from external sources, although there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving that goal. We believe that our access to the capital markets and funds that may be available from other third party sources, together with cash expected to be generated from operations, will be sufficient to fund our PayPal Credit products for the foreseeable future. In the second quarter of 2014, we agreed, subject to certain conditions, that we, one of our affiliates or a designated third party would purchase a portfolio of consumer loan receivables relating to the customer accounts arising out of our credit program agreement with Synchrony Financial (formerly GE Capital Retail Bank) for a price based on the book value of the consumer loan receivables portfolio at the time of the purchase (expected to be October 2016), subject to certain adjustments and exclusions. In the third quarter of 2015, we amended and extended the existing credit card program agreement on new terms. As part of the amended agreement, our obligation to purchase the portfolio of consumer loan receivables relating to the customer accounts arising out of the credit program agreement with Synchrony Financial was terminated. We retain an option to purchase the portfolio at the end of the new contract term.In January 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program that provides for the repurchase of up to $2 billion of our common stock, with no expiration from the date of authorization. This stock repurchase program is intended to offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and, subject to market conditions and other factors, may also be used to make opportunistic repurchases of our common stock to reduce outstanding share count. Any share repurchases under our stock repurchase program may be made through open market transactions, block trades, privately negotiated transactions or other means at times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate and will be funded from our working capital or other financing alternatives. However, any stock repurchases are subject to market conditions and other uncertainties and we cannot predict if or when any stock repurchases will be made. Moreover, we may terminate our stock repurchase program at any time without notice. Our liquidity, access to capital and borrowing costs could be adversely impacted by declines in our credit rating, our financial performance, and global credit market conditions, as well as a broad range of other factors. In addition, our liquidity, access to capital and borrowing costs could also be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. See “Risk Factors—Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition” and “Note 11—Commitments and Contingencies” to the combined and consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these and other risks facing our business.We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, available-for-sale investments, cash expected to be generated from operations, and our expected access to capital markets, together with potential external funding through third party sources, such as commercial banks, private equity firms, and sovereign wealth funds, will be sufficient to fund our operating activities, anticipated capital expenditures, and PayPal Credit products for the foreseeable future. 46 Table of Contents 47 Table of Contents 48 Table of Contents Cash Flows Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 (In millions)Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities$2,546 $2,220 $1,993Investing activities(6,389) (1,546) (1,721)Financing activities3,079 (51) (85)Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents(44) (26) 3Net increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$(808) $597 $190 Operating Activities Cash flows from operating activities includes net income adjusted for certain non-cash expenses, timing differences between expenses recognized for provision for transaction and loan losses and actual transaction losses paid, and changes in other assets and liabilities. Significant non-cash expenses for the period include depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and deferred tax expenses. The expenses recognized for provision for transaction losses are estimates of the transaction losses incurred during the period but for which cash has not been paid. The cash impact from actual transaction losses paid during a period are reflected as a negative impact to changes in other current and non-current assets in cash from operating activities. The expenses recognized during the period for provision for loan losses are estimates of probable incurred losses on our PayPal Credit products for which the receivable has not been charged off. Actual charge offs of receivables related to our PayPal Credit products are reflected as a reduction in changes in principal loans receivable impacting investing activities and thus have no impact on cash from operating activities.We generated cash from operating activities of $2.5 billion in 2015 due primarily to operating income of approximately $1.5 billion. Adjustments for non-cash expenses of depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation including excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation were approximately $928 million during 2015. Adjustments for non-cash expenses related to transaction and loan losses were approximately $809 million during 2015. The cash generated from operating activities was offset by uses of cash from increases in working capital primarily related to transaction loss allowance for cash losses, net. Additional uses of cash impacting cash generated from operating activities include net cash outflows relating to settlement of eBay payables and receivables of approximately $96 million and increases in accounts receivable of approximately $22 million.We generated cash from operating activities of $2.2 billion in 2014 and $2.0 billion in 2013, due primarily to operating income of $1.3 billion in 2014 and $1.1 billion in 2013. Adjustments for non-cash expenses of depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation including excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation were approximately $774 million during 2014 and $630 million during 2013. Adjustments for non-cash expenses for transaction and loan losses were $646 million during 2014 and $502 million during 2013. The cash generated from operating activities was offset by uses of cash primarily related to transaction loss allowance for cash losses, net and changes in other working capital.Cash paid for income taxes in 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $216 million, $47 million and $28 million, respectively. Investing Activities The net cash used in investing activities of $6.4 billion in 2015 was due primarily to purchases of available for sale investments of $7.5 billion, cash paid for acquisitions (net of cash acquired) of $1.2 billion, increases in our loan receivable portfolio (net of collections) originated through our PayPal Credit products of $819 million and purchases of property and equipment of $722 million, due in part to the separation from eBay. These net cash outflows were offset by maturities and sales of investments of $3.3 billion and net cash inflows relating to receivables from eBay of $575 million.The net cash used in investing activities of $1.5 billion in 2014 was due primarily to increases in our loan receivable portfolio (net of collections) originated through our PayPal Credit products of $1.0 billion, purchases of property and equipment of $492 million and net cash outflows relating to receivables from eBay of $362 million, offset by and net cash received for maturities and sales of investments of $409 million.The net cash used in investing activities of $1.7 billion in 2013 was due primarily to increases in our loan receivable portfolio (net of collections and charge-offs) originated through our PayPal Credit products of $793 million, cash paid for acquisitions (net of cash acquired) of $731 million, purchases of investments of $610 million and purchases of property and equipment of $391 million, offset by net cash inflows relating to receivables from eBay of $484 million and cash received for maturities and sales of investments of $320 million. 49 Table of Contents Financing Activities The net cash provided by financing activities of $3.1 billion in 2015 was due primarily to a contribution of approximately $3.9 billion of cash from eBay, offset by repayments of borrowings from eBay of $862 million.The net cash used in financing activities of $51 million in 2014 and $85 million in 2013 was due primarily to net cash outflows relating to repayments of borrowings from eBay. Free Cash Flow We define free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. Free cash flow was $1.8 billion in 2015, an increase of $96 million from 2014. The increase in free cash flow during the period was primarily due to higher cash generated from operating activities of $326 million offset by higher purchases of property and equipment of $230 million. Free cash flow generated during 2015 was used for general business purposes and towards our acquisitions completed in 2015. Free cash flow was $1.7 billion in 2014, an increase of $126 million from 2013. The increase in free cash flow during the period was primarily due to higher cash generated from operating activities of $227 million offset by higher purchases of property and equipment of $101 million. Free cash flow generated during 2014 was used to fund our increase in loans to consumers and merchants.Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Information\" for information on how we compute free cash flow and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Effect of Exchange Rates on Cash The negative effect of currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents during 2015 and 2014 of $44 million and $26 million, respectively, was due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against certain foreign currencies, primarily the Euro. There was minimal impact of currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents during 2013. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our combined and consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Future Liquidity and Obligations As of December 31, 2015, approximately $24.8 billion of unused credit was available to PayPal Credit account holders. While this amount represents the total unused credit available, we have not experienced, and do not anticipate, that all of our PayPal Credit account holders will access their entire available credit at any given point in time. In addition, the individual lines of credit that make up this unused credit are subject to periodic review and termination by the chartered financial institution that is the issuer of PayPal Credit products based on, among other things, account usage and customer creditworthiness. When a consumer funds a purchase in the U.S. using a PayPal Credit product issued by a chartered financial institution, the chartered financial institution extends credit to the consumer, funds the extension of credit at the point of sale and advances funds to the merchant. We subsequently purchase the receivables related to the consumer loans extended by the chartered financial institution and, as a result of such purchase, bear the risk of loss in the event of loan defaults. Although the chartered financial institution continues to own each customer account, we own the related receivable (excluding participation interests sold) and are responsible for all servicing functions related to the account.We have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments for general operating purposes. Changes in our business needs, contractual cancellation provisions, fluctuating interest rates, and other factors may result in actual payments differing from the estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of these payments. The following table summarizes our obligations as of December 31, 2015 that are expected to impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods. We believe we will be able to fund these obligations through our existing cash and investment portfolio and cash expected to be generated from operations. 50 Table of Contents Payments Due During the Year Ending December 31,PurchaseObligations OperatingLeases Total (In millions)2016$269 $55 $324201773 51 124201832 49 81201920 38 58202010 32 42Thereafter— 129 129 $404 $354 $758 The significant assumptions used in our determination of amounts presented in the above table are as follows:•Purchase obligation amounts include minimum purchase commitments for advertising, capital expenditures (computer equipment, software applications, engineering development services, construction contracts) and other goods and services entered into in the ordinary course of business.•Lease amounts include minimum rental payments under our non-cancelable operating leases for office facilities, fulfillment centers, as well as computer and office equipment that we utilize under lease arrangements. The amounts presented are consistent with contractual terms and are not expected to differ significantly from actual results under our existing leases, unless a substantial change in our headcount needs requires us to expand our occupied space or exit an office facility early.As we are unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits, net, the table does not include $288 million of such non-current liabilities included in deferred and other tax liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. Seasonality The Company does not experience meaningful seasonality. No individual quarter in 2015, 2014 or 2013 accounted for more than 30% of net revenue. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The application of U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect our reported financial condition. We have established detailed policies and control procedures to provide reasonable assurance that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period. The accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to our financial statements. An accounting estimate is considered critical if both (a) the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (b) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to our financial condition. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Our significant accounting policies, including recent accounting pronouncements, are described in Note 1 - Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the combined and consolidated annual financial statements.A quantitative sensitivity analysis is provided where that information is reasonably available, can be reliably estimated and provides material information to investors. The amounts used to assess sensitivity are included to allow users of this report to understand a general direction cause and effect of changes in the estimates and do not represent management’s predictions of variability. For all of these estimates, it should be noted that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted, and estimates require regular review and adjustment. Transaction and loan losses Transaction and loan losses include the expense associated with our customer protection programs, fraud, chargebacks, and credit losses associated with our loans receivable balances. We expect our transaction and loan losses to fluctuate depending on many factors, including: the total TPV, macroeconomic conditions, the extent of our customer protection programs, the impact of regulatory changes, and the credit quality of loans receivable arising from transactions funded with our PayPal Credit products and working capital advances to selected merchant sellers.We establish allowances for estimated transaction losses arising from processing customer transactions, such as chargebacks for unauthorized credit card use and merchant-related chargebacks due to non-delivery of goods or services, ACH returns, buyer protection program claims, account take-overs, and account overdrafts. Additions to the allowance, in the form of provisions, are reflected in transaction and loan losses in our combined and consolidated statements of income. The allowances, which involve the use of actuarial techniques, are monitored monthly and are updated based on actual claims data reported by our claims processors and other actual data received. The allowances are based on known facts and circumstances, internal factors including experience with similar cases, historical trends involving loss payment patterns, and the mix of transaction and loss types.We also establish an allowance for loans receivable which represents our estimate of probable incurred loan losses inherent in our consumer loans receivable and merchant working capital advances. Increases to the allowance for loans receivable are reflected as transaction and loan losses in our combined and consolidated financial statements. This evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates and judgments, and is primarily based on forecasted principal balance delinquency rates (“roll rates”). Roll rates represent the percentage of balances which we estimate will migrate from one stage of delinquency to the next based on our historical experience, as well as external factors such as estimated bankruptcies and levels of unemployment. Roll rates are applied to principal balances for each stage of delinquency, from current to 180 days past due, in order to estimate the principal loans which have incurred a loss event and are probable to be charged off. The determination of delinquency, from current to 180 days past due, for principal balances related to merchant working capital advances is based on the current expected repayment period of the advance and fixed fee as compared to the original expected repayment period. We calculate the repayment rate based on the merchant's expected future payment volume such that repayment of the advance and fixed fee is typically expected to occur within 9 to 12 months from the date of the advance. On a monthly basis, we recalculate the repayment period based on the actual repayment activity on the receivable. As such, actual repayment periods are dependent on actual payment processing volumes. The allowance for loss against the interest and fees receivable is primarily determined by applying historical average customer account roll rates to the interest receivable balance in each stage of delinquency to project the value of accounts that have incurred losses and are probable to be charged off. We charge off loans receivable balances in the month in which the customer balance becomes 180 days past due. Bankrupt accounts are charged off within 60 days of receiving notification from the bankruptcy courts. Past due loans receivable continue to accrue interest until such time as they are charged off, with the portion of the reserve related to interest receivable balance classified as a reduction of revenue.Determining appropriate allowances for these losses is an inherently uncertain process and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates. We regularly update our allowance estimates as new facts become known and events occur that may impact the settlement or recovery of losses. The allowances are maintained at a level we deem appropriate to adequately provide for losses incurred at the balance sheet date. Based on our results for the year ended December 31, 2015, an aggregate ten percentage increase in our transaction and loan loss rate would negatively impact transaction and loan losses by approximately $81 million. 51 Table of Contents Accounting for Income Taxes Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective government taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. Our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rates that apply to our foreign earnings. In addition to local country tax laws and regulations, our income tax rate depends on the extent that our earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management’s judgment about and intentions concerning our future operations. To the extent we do not intend to repatriate these earnings to fund U.S. operations, we do not provide for U.S. federal income and foreign withholding tax on these earnings.Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates that are based on a number of factors, including our historical experience and short range and long-range business forecasts. To the extent deferred tax assets are not expected to be realized, we record a valuation allowance.We recognize and measure uncertain tax positions in accordance with GAAP, pursuant to which we only recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. GAAP further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings in the quarter in which such change occurs. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.We file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions around the world. A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited by the relevant tax authorities and finally resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our reserves for income taxes are adequate such that we reflect the benefits more likely than not to be sustained in an examination. We adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest, where appropriate in light of changing facts and circumstances. Settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash.Based on our results for the year ended December 31, 2015, a one-percentage point increase in our provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes would have resulted in an increase in the provision of approximately $15 million. 52 Table of Contents Loss Contingencies We are currently involved in various claims, legal proceedings and investigations of potential operating violations by regulatory oversight authorities. We regularly review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim, legal proceeding or potential regulatory violation is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims, litigation or other violation and may revise our estimates. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes. Revenue Recognition Application of the various accounting principles in U.S. GAAP related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires us to make judgments and estimates. Complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting. Specifically, the determination of whether we are a principal to a transaction (gross revenue) or an agent (net revenue) can require considerable judgment. Further, we provide incentive payments to consumers and merchants, which require judgment to determine whether the payments should be recorded as a reduction to gross revenue. Changes in judgments with respect to these assumptions and estimates could impact the amount of revenue recognized. Valuation of Goodwill and Intangibles The valuation of assets acquired in a business combination and asset impairment reviews require the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to estimate the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill. Impairment testing for assets, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, requires the allocation of cash flows to those assets or group of assets and if required, an estimate of fair value for the assets or group of assets. Our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. These valuations require the use of management’s assumptions, which would not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur.We evaluate goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or sooner if indicators of impairment exist. Under the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) guidance, the evaluation of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment allows for qualitative assessment to be performed, which is similar to the FASB guidance for evaluating goodwill for impairment. In performing these qualitative assessments, we consider relevant events and conditions, including but not limited to: macroeconomic trends, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance, cost factors, company-specific events, legal and regulatory factors and our market capitalization (previously assessed under eBay). If the qualitative assessments indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than their carrying amounts, we must perform a quantitative impairment test.Under the quantitative impairment test, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset, an impairment loss is recorded in the Combined and Consolidated Statement of Income. Measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit is based on one or more of the following fair value measures: amounts at which the unit as a whole could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties, using present value techniques of estimated future cash flows, or using valuation techniques based on multiples of earnings or revenue, or a similar performance measure. 53 Table of Contents Market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity price risk. Management establishes and oversees the implementation of policies governing our investing, funding, and foreign currency derivative activities in order to mitigate market risks. We monitor risk exposures on an ongoing basis. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to interest rate risk relating to our investment portfolio and from interest-rate sensitive assets underlying the customer balances we hold on our condensed combined and consolidated balance sheet as customer accounts. We seek to reduce earnings volatility that may result from changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, approximately 24% and 97% of our total cash and investment portfolio was held in cash and cash equivalents. The proportionate decrease was primarily driven by an increase in available-for-sale investments of $4.3 billion for 2015. Prior to the separation, PayPal participated in eBay Inc.’s cash pooling arrangement and had limited available-for-sale investment activity. As part of the capitalization we received from eBay a cash contribution of approximately $3.8 billion which was used to purchase available-for-sale investments. We held no direct investments in auction rate securities, collateralized debt obligations, structured investment vehicles or mortgage-backed securities in any periods presented. For additional details related to our investment activities, please see “Note 5—Investments” to the combined and consolidated financial statements included in this report. The assets underlying the customer balances we hold on our combined and consolidated balance sheet as customer accounts are maintained in interest and non-interest bearing bank deposits, time deposits, and U.S. and foreign government and agency securities. We classify the assets underlying the customer balances as current based on their purpose and availability to fulfill our direct obligation under amounts due to customers. We seek to preserve principal while holding eligible liquid assets, as defined by applicable regulatory requirements and commercial law in jurisdictions where we operate, equal to at least 100% of the aggregate amount of all customer balances. We do not pay interest on amounts due to customers.In the third quarter of 2015, we entered into a $2 billion senior unsecured credit facility maturing in 2020. Borrowings under the revolving facility, if any, bear interest at floating rates. As a result, we will be exposed to fluctuations in interest rates to the extent of our borrowings under the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2015, no borrowings or letters of credit were outstanding under the Credit Agreement. Interest rates may also adversely impact our customers’ spending levels and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amounts owed to us. Higher interest rates often lead to higher payment obligations by customers to us and other lenders under mortgage, credit card and other consumer loans, which may reduce our customers’ ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore lead to increased delinquencies, charge-offs and allowance for loan and interest receivable which could have an adverse effect on our net earnings. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would not have had a material impact on our financial assets or liabilities as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. Foreign Currency Risk We have significant operations internationally that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar, subjecting us to foreign currency risk which may adversely impact our financial results. We transact business in various foreign currencies and have significant international revenues as well as costs. In addition, we charge our international subsidiaries for their use of intellectual property and technology and for certain corporate services. Our cash flow, results of operations and certain of our intercompany balances that are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses due to foreign currency fluctuations and related hedging activities. We are generally a net receiver of foreign currencies and therefore benefit from a weakening of the U.S. dollar, and are adversely affected by a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, relative to foreign currencies.We have a foreign exchange exposure management program designed to identify material foreign currency exposures, manage these exposures and reduce the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our reported combined and consolidated cash flows and results of operations through the execution of foreign currency exchange contracts. These foreign currency exchange contracts are accounted for as derivative instruments; for additional details related to our foreign currency exchange contracts, please see “Note 7—Derivative Instruments” to the combined and consolidated financial statements included in this report.We use foreign exchange forward contracts to protect our forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These hedging contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movements. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. The effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (\"AOCI\") and subsequently reclassified into revenue in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the unrealized gains and losses on these contracts, if any, is recorded immediately in earnings. We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that changes in exchange rates of 20% for all currencies could be experienced in the near term. If the U.S. dollar weakened by 20% at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign exchange forward contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately $321 million and $294 million lower, respectively. If the U.S. dollar strengthened by 20% at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign exchange forward contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately $321 million and $294 million higher, respectively.We have an additional foreign exchange management program whereby we use foreign exchange contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. These contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency gains and losses on our assets and liabilities are recorded in “Other income (expense), net,” which are offset by the gains and losses on the foreign exchange contracts.Adverse changes in exchange rates of 20% for all currencies would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately $136 million and $32 million at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, without considering the offsetting effect of hedging. Foreign exchange contracts in place as of December 31, 2015 would have positively impacted income before income taxes by approximately $133 million, resulting in a net negative impact of approximately $3 million. Foreign exchange contracts in place as of December 31, 2014 would have positively impacted income before income taxes by approximately $34 million, resulting in a net positive impact of approximately $2 million. These reasonably possible adverse changes in exchange rates of 20% were applied to total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of our subsidiaries at the balance sheet dates to compute the adverse impact these changes would have had on our income before income taxes in the near term. 54 Table of Contents Equity Price Risk As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, our cost and equity method investments totaled $26 million and $31 million, respectively, which represented less than 1% of our total cash and investment portfolio and were primarily related to cost method investments in privately held companies. We did not hold any marketable equity instruments. We review our investments for impairment when events and circumstances indicate a decline in fair value of such assets below carrying value is other-than-temporary. Our analysis includes a review of recent operating results and trends, recent sales and acquisitions of the securities in which we have invested and other publicly available data. European Debt Exposures We actively monitor our exposure to the European markets, including the impact of sovereign debt issues associated with Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we did not have any direct investments in the sovereign debt of these countries or in debt securities issued by corporations or financial institutions organized in these countries. We maintain a small number of operating bank accounts with local and foreign banks in the aforementioned countries that have balances that we do not consider material. 55 Table of Contents",
